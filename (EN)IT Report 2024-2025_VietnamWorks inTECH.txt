PART 1

1.1. introduction
2023 marked a period of rapid development, with Artificial Intelligence (AI) becoming a mainstream
trend and a focal point of both excitement and concern in the technology sector. In 2024, AI
technology continues to be a hot topic and has the potential to bring about significant breakthroughs
in the future. Automation and AI contribute to increase productivity and economic growth, but millions
of people worldwide may need to transition their careers or upgrade their skills to adapt.

Numerous market reports and news articles predict that AI has the potential to replace IT personnel
while also creating new job opportunities. With a mission to be Vietnam's leading IT recruitment brand,
VietnamWorks inTECH launches a Report on Human Resources and Recruitment Trends in the IT
Industry Amidst the Artificial Intelligence Surge of 2024-2025. This report provides valuable insights
for IT professionals in their career development and for businesses in their upcoming recruitment
plans.


1.2. Methodology
This report is based on a survey of 2,000 participants (including IT candidates and businesses)
throughout Vietnam. This survey was conducted from July 22nd, 2024 to August 22nd, 2024 through
VietnamWorks inTECH ecosystems.

Data is anonymized according to General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) guidelines and is stored
separately and used only for reporting analysis. Percentages may not always equal 100% due to
different options and different response behaviors. Many questions are only shown to respondents
based on their previous answers.

In addition, we also use some data from public reliable sources.

1.3. Disclaimer
The information in the report is compiled and analyzed from responses from 1,500 IT candidates from
many positions, programming languages, years of experience, provinces, etc., and 500 businesses from
July and August 2024.

Although the report has been collected and analyzed with the most detail and transparency, this
report does not represent the entire IT industry market and is for reference only.

All information in the report may not be copied in whole or in part without written consent from
VietnamWorks inTECH.

Human Resources and Recruitment Trends in the IT Industry
Amidst the Artificial Intelligence Surge of 2024-2025

1.4. Highlight from the report

04

1

60% of IT personnels laid off in 2023 have yet to find new jobs in 2024

2

IT professionals are willing to take on more workloads and multitasking to find
new jobs quickly

3

Threads becomes a new source for job seeking and recruitment

4

Skilled Product Owners/Product Managers are in short supply

5

AI Chatbots surpass Stack Overflow in terms of top-rated pages/tools for
code solutions

6

Salaries for AI candidates are 10-50% higher than other positions

IT personnel continue to be significantly impacted by the aftermath of layoffs, as
nearly 60% of those laid off in the previous year have still not found new employment
in 2024. This figure is approximately 1.5 times higher compared to the corresponding
rate for IT personnel who voluntarily left their jobs in 2023 (page 19)


To find new jobs quickly, many IT professionals are willing to consider taking on heavier
workloads and multitasking. This figure has increased by 10% compared to the previous
year, indicating the increasing competitiveness of the job market (page 22).

Although the social network Threads is relatively new, 4.4% of IT professionals use it to
search for jobs, and 2.4% of companies reported using it to reach out to candidates
(page 23 and page 28).


Based on a survey of recruiters, Product Owners/Product Managers are the most
difficult positions to fill, accounting for 25.6% of total responses (page 30). Most
companies believe that this position is difficult to fill because candidates do not meet
the required qualifications.

AI Chatbots like ChatGPT and Gemini are gradually becoming indispensable tools for IT
professionals to solve coding-related tasks, as they have the second most responses to
the question: "What is the first page/tool IT personnel think of when seeking solutions
to coding problems?" (page 35).

Survey results show that a majority of companies are willing to offer higher salaries for
AI candidates compared to other positions. Specifically, 43.7% of companies reported
that they pay AI personnel 10-20% more, while 18.4% indicated that the salaries of AIrelated titles are 20-50% higher than non AI-related titles (page 43).

Based on the survey, it can be concluded that:

Senior-level positions filled the fastest: Individuals in Leader/Manager and Head/CTO/COO roles found

new employment in the shortest time, often within a month. This suggests a high demand for leadership

and high level positions in the IT industry.


Senior

and Middle-level

professionals had comparable job search durations: Both Senior

and Middle-level

employees had a high percentage of finding new jobs within three months, indicating a relatively active

job market for these levels.


A small percentage of employees across all levels took a significant amount of time to find a new job:

While most employees found employment quickly, a small but notable proportion, especially at the

Fresher level, took a year or more. This could be attributed to lower demand for entry-level positions in the

current job market.


Significant variations across job levels: Despite some similarities, the chart reveals distinct differences in job

search durations across various levels. This indicates that job opportunities and hiring requirements vary

significantly between different job levels
