                  Welcome to
               Exploring Strategy
Strategy is a crucial subject. It’s about the development, success and failure of all kinds
of organisations, from multinationals to entrepreneurial start-ups, from charities to
government agencies, and many more. Strategy raises the big questions about these
organisations – how they grow, how they innovate and how they change. As a manager or
an entrepreneur, you will be involved in shaping, implementing or communicating these
strategies.
   Our primary aim with Exploring Strategy is to give you a comprehensive understanding
of the issues and techniques of strategy. We can also help you get a great final result in your
course. You can make the most of the text by:

• Exploring hot topics in cutting-edge issues such as business models, corporate gover-
  nance, innovation, entrepreneurship and strategy practice.
• Engaging with our ‘Thinking Differently’ sections to access novel and distinctive perspec-
  tives on core themes in strategy
• Using the ‘Strategy Lenses’ to think critically and originally about key topics and to set you
  on your way to better grades in your assignments and exams.
• Pursuing some of the recommended readings at the end of each chapter. They’re specially
  selected as accessible and valuable sources that will enhance your learning and give you
  an extra edge in your course work.

We want Exploring Strategy to give you what you need: a comprehensive view of the
subject, an ambition to put that into practice, and – of course – success in your studies. We
hope that you’ll be as excited by the key issues of strategy as we are!

So, read on and good luck!

Preface

     We are delighted to offer this twelfth edition of Exploring Strategy. With sales of previous
     editions now well over one million worldwide, we believe we have a tried and tested product.
     Yet the strategy field is constantly changing. For this edition, therefore, we have thoroughly
     refreshed all chapters, with new concepts, new cases and new examples throughout. Here we
     would like to highlight three principal changes, while recalling some of the classic features
     of the book.
        As well as more detailed changes, the twelfth edition has the following principal changes:

     • a stronger focus on technology strategy: reflecting today’s culture of rapid technolog-
       ical change, we have developed the discussion of business models and ecosystems, with
       concepts such as multisided platforms and peer-to-peer models.
     • an updated approach to corporate strategy: with radical changes to the nature of the
       corporation, this edition enhances its treatment of divestment as well as acquisitions and
       mergers
     • a revised approach to strategy evaluation: we focus our discussion of the evaluation of
       strategic options on practical techniques, adding for instance DuPont pyramid analysis

       At the same time, Exploring Strategy retains its longstanding commitment to a compre-
     hensive and real-world view of strategy. In particular, this entails a deep concern for:

     • Process: we believe that the human processes of strategy, not only the economics of partic-
       ular strategies, are central to achieving long-term organisational success. Throughout the
       book, we underline the importance of human processes, but in particular we devote Part
       III to processes of strategy formation, implementation and change.
     • Practice: we conclude the book with a chapter on the Practice of Strategy (Chapter 16),
       focused on the practicalities of managing strategy. Throughout the book, we introduce
       concepts and techniques through practical illustrations and applications, rather than
       abstract descriptions..

     Many people have helped us with the development of this new edition. Jason Evans and
     Clive Kerridge have led in coordinating the case collection. We have consulted carefully with
     reviewers and our Advisory Board, made up of experienced lecturers, many of whom are
     adopters of the book. Many other adopters of the book provide more informal advice and
     suggestions – many of whom we have had the pleasure of meeting at our annual teachers’
     workshops. This kind of feedback is invaluable and we hope you will keep the comments
     flowing. Also, our students and clients at Lancaster University, Oxford University, Stockholm
     School of Economics, Sheffield Hallam and the many other places where we teach are a
     constant source of ideas and stimulus. We also gain from our links across the world, particu-
     larly in Austria, Ireland, the Netherlands, Denmark, Sweden, France, Canada, China, Australia,
     New Zealand, Hong Kong, Malaysia, Morocco, Singapore and the USA. Many contribute
     directly by providing case studies and illustrations and these are acknowledged in the text.

          Finally, we thank those organisations that have been generous enough to be written up as
          case studies. We hope that those using the book will respect the wishes of the case study
          organisations and not contact them directly for further information.

Exploring Strategy features

     This twelfth edition of Exploring Strategy builds on the established strengths of this best-
     selling textbook. A range of in-text features and supplementary features have been devel-
     oped to enable you and your students to gain maximum added value from the teaching and
     learning of strategy.

     • Outstanding pedagogical features. Each chapter has clear learning outcomes, practical
       questions associated with real-life illustrations and examples which students can easily
       apply to what they have learnt.
     • Flexibility of use. You can choose to use either the Text and Cases version of the book,
       or – if you don’t use longer cases (or have your own) – the Text-only version.

     The two versions are complemented by a concise version of the text, Fundamentals of
     Strategy, and instructors also have the option of further customising the text. Speak to your
     local Pearson Sales Representative if you would like to explore customization options.

     • Up-to-date materials. we have fully revised all chapters, incorporating new research and
       updating references so that you can easily access the latest research.
     • Encouraging innovative and critical thinking. The Strategy Lenses and commentaries
       are designed to encourage critical thinking, while each chapter ends with a ‘Thinking
       Differently’ section, introducing students new and distinctive approaches to key issues of
       the chapter.
     • Our ‘three circles’ framework – depicting the overlapping issues of strategic position,
       strategic choices and strategy-in-action – also challenges a simple linear, sequential view
       of the strategy process.
     • Case and examples. A wide range of Illustrations, Case Examples and (in the Text and
       Cases version) longer Case Studies are fresh and engage with student interests and
       day-to-day experience. Many of these are entirely new to this edition; others have been
       extensively revised. We draw these examples from all over the world and use examples
       from the public and voluntary sectors as well as the private.
     • Teaching and learning support. You and your students can access a wealth of resources
       detailed in the Exploring Strategy Online section that follows this.
     • Teachers’ workshop. We run an annual workshop to facilitate discussion of key challenges
       and solutions in the teaching of strategic management. Details of forthcoming workshops
       can be found at: https://heuk.pearson.com/events.html

Digital Courseware

     Revel is an interactive learning environment designed for how you want to teach — and
     how your students want to learn. Cleverly combining reading material with interactive
     videos, quizzes and writing activities, it enriches the learning experience and boosts student
     performance.

     We have launched Exploring Strategy in Revel, which offers interactive media, including
     videos and writing activities, within the narrative content to reinforce key concepts and
     encourage exploration and application of a complex and diverse subject area. It caters to
     today’s modern strategy students, who need a hands-on, applied and current exploration
     to the subject.

     Unlike any existing resource, Revel for Strategy allows lecturers to bring strategy to life
     and drive engagement across large classes, increasing students’ understanding of the key
     concepts, encouraging them to reflect on their actions, build confidence, and helping them
     to evaluate the impact of their decisions.

     MyStrategyExperience is an engaging and rigorous simulation designed to bring together
     the theory and practice of strategy-making in the realistic environment of a dynamic organ-
     isation and industry. The simulation puts students on the board of directors in a global
     advertising agency and allows them to make a strategic analysis of the business, put together
     a business plan and then make a number of challenging decisions on the future strategy of
     the company.

     As students set and implement strategy, they will see the impact of their decisions on
     financial and non-financial measures of performance within the simulated company. Your
     students will need to balance strategic opportunities with inherent risk thus gaining knowl-
     edge and insights relevant to their strategic studies.

     The simulation draws on the content of Exploring Strategy and the two can be used to
     complement each other on a strategy course.

1.1 Introduction
          The Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of a medium-sized family business knew they had a
          problem. New aggressive competition in their main European markets was threatening their
          performance just as demand was softening. To help him address this major problem the
          CEO invited in a consultancy firm to assess whether this was the right time for his business
          to find new international markets for growth or to invest more in product innovation to
          stimulate demand. Claudia, the junior consultant in the team, heard the consulting partner
          explain how they would carry out a systematic analysis of the company’s situation to under-
          stand its success, assess the challenges posed by the competition and shifting markets and
          identify broader opportunities and threats from the wider environment. It would be her
          task to assemble key data and conduct analysis to generate future possible options for the
          business. These would help inform the CEO’s decision about how his business could improve
          its competitive position. The consulting firm would assist with implementation if needed.
              The problem presented by the CEO to the consultants is one of strategy. It is concerned
          with key issues for the future of the organisation. For instance, how should the company
          compete in the future with aggressive new entrants? What growth options are there for
          the company? If further internationalisation is a good strategy, what would be the optimal
          method to achieve this outcome and what might be the resourcing implications? All of these
          strategy questions are vital to the future survival of the organisation.
              Strategy questions naturally concern entrepreneurs and senior managers at the top of
          their organisations. But these questions matter more widely. Outside of the organisation,
          stakeholders such as investors, including banks, venture capitalists and analysts, influence
          the strategy. Inside the organisation, middle managers also have to understand the strategic
          direction, both to know how to get top management support for their initiatives and to
          explain it to the people they are responsible for. Anybody looking for a management-track job
          needs to be ready to discuss strategy with their potential employer. Indeed, anybody taking
          a job should first be confident that their new employer’s strategy is actually viable. There
          are even specialist career opportunities in strategy, for example like Claudia, as a strategy
          consultant or as an in-house strategic planner, often key roles for fast-track young managers.

Chapter 1 Introducing strategy


                       This book is relevant to any kind of organisation responsible for its own direction into the
                    future. Thus the book refers to large private sector multinationals and small entrepreneurial
                    start-ups; to family businesses, both large and small; to public-sector organisations such as
                    schools and hospitals; and to not-for-profits such as charities or sports clubs. Strategy matters
                    to almost all organisations, and to everybody working in them.
                       In this chapter you will begin with examining the main definitions of strategy, build your
                    understanding of strategy’s purpose, be introduced to the Exploring Strategy Framework for
                    analysing an organisation’s strategy and increase your awareness of working, as students
                    and managers, with strategy in different contexts (see Figure 1.1). But first, why is the book
                    entitled Exploring Strategy?


                    1.1.1 Why ‘Exploring Strategy’?
                    There are a large number of strategy textbooks available on the market so it is important
                    to realise why readers choose Exploring Strategy. As strategists we believe that one of strat-
                    egy’s distinctive features is that it draws upon many other perspectives, including economics,
                    finance, marketing, operational management, organisational behaviour, psychology to
                    name a few. However many strategy textbooks adopt a single disciplinary focus, such as an
                    economics perspective, for instance, that ignores other critical issues, such as the work of
                    strategists, the influence of organisational politics, history and culture. Others focus much
                    more on the behavioural side of strategy and largely overlook the importance of finance
                    and economics. Exploring Strategy is distinctive in emphasising a comprehensive view of
                    strategy, and this will enable you to explore the insights of many disciplinary perspec-
                    tives including both the economics of strategy and the people side of managing strategy
                    in practice.
                       A further reason for the word ‘Exploring’ in the title is rooted in the practical world of
                    strategy work. Our focus on the practice and practicalities of strategy reveals that there are
                    rarely obvious answers. Indeed, many strategy problems are highly complex and managers
                    should beware of over-simplified ‘solutions’. Therefore in strategy it is important both to
                    recognise the real scope of problems and to explore several options. Through exploration
                    you will widen your awareness of practical issues relevant to strategy, recognise the difficul-
                    ties of interconnectedness, and probe each option carefully before making informed choices.
                    We therefore believe that major strengths of Exploring Strategy, its comprehensiveness and
                    focus upon practice, will help reduce your risk of myopia to enable you to produce well-
                    informed, grounded solutions to complex strategic problems.
                       We also believe that ‘Exploring’ in the title is appropriate as this is a research-led book,
                    drawing upon world-class research and including the latest thinking on key strategic topics.
                    These feature throughout Exploring Strategy and particularly pioneering work is found in
                    the ‘Thinking differently’ sections at the ends of chapters. The ‘Strategy lens’ sections at the
                    end of the main parts of the book also introduce novel and distinctive themes. These will
                    ensure that you are at the cutting edge of strategy.
                       Exploring Strategy also explores a wide range of organisational and geographic contexts.
                    Through a diverse and substantial selection of illustrations and case studies, we include large
                    multinationals as well as medium-sized and entrepreneurial start-up firms. We give weight
                    not only to ‘for-profit’ companies but also family businesses that may also be not-for-profit,
                    public sector and other not-for-profit organisations. We examine these not only in devel-
                    oped economies in the West but also in a wide range of emerging markets and developing
                    countries. This broad base of organisations and contexts will give you a wider knowledge
                    base than is common in other strategy texts.

1.2 What is strategy?1
                           The origins of the word strategy have been traced back to the city of Athens in the sixth
                           century BC where it was developed to name a new military and political leadership posi-
                           tion. It combined the words stratos, which meant ‘army spread out over the ground’, and
                           agein, meaning ‘to lead’.2 To this practical consideration of managing and directing a large
                           complex force, the importance of strategy was highlighted by the Chinese military philos-
                           opher Sun Tzu, who defined strategy as ‘the great work of the organization. In situations
                           of life or death, it is the Tao of survival or extinction’ (Tao is a Chinese word that indicates
                           ‘path’, ‘way’, ‘route’ and even ‘principle’). Since that time there have been many new defin-
                           itions of the word strategy, particularly by the military, but in the 1960s Alfred Chandler,
                           strategy’s founding theorist, brought strategy formally into a business context.3 Since then,
                           definitions of strategy have continued to refine our understanding of the term and several
                           prominent ones are examined below. However, for this book our initial basic definition of
                           strategy, which we shall elaborate upon at the end of the chapter, is as follows: strategy is
                           the long-term direction of an organisation. Thus, for example, the long-term direction of
                           Amazon is from book retailing to internet services in general. For Disney, it is from cartoons to
                           diversified entertainment. This section examines the practical implication of this definition of
                           strategy; distinguishes between different levels of strategy; and explains how to summarise
                           an organisation’s strategy in a ‘strategy statement’.


                           1.2.1 Defining strategy
                           Defining strategy as the long-term direction of an organisation implies a more compre-
                           hensive view than some influential definitions. Figure 1.2 shows the strategy definitions of
                           several leading strategy theorists: Alfred Chandler and Michael Porter, both from the Harvard
                           Business School, Peter Drucker from Claremont University, California and Henry Mintzberg,
                           from McGill University, Canada. Each points to important elements of strategy. Chandler
                           emphasises a logical flow from the determination of goals and objectives to the alloca-
                           tion of resources. Porter focuses on deliberate choices, difference and competition. Drucker
                           suggests that it is a theory about how a firm will win.4 Mintzberg, however, takes the view

                                    ‘. . . the determination of the long-run goals and objectives of an
                             enterprise and the adoption of courses of action and the allocation of resources

                                                                 Alfred D. Chandler



                              ‘Competitive strategy is about being different. It means deliberately choosing a

                                                                   Michael Porter

                    that strategy is less certain and uses the word ‘pattern’ to allow for the fact that strategies
                    do not always follow a deliberately chosen and logical plan, but can emerge in more ad hoc
                    ways. Sometimes strategies reflect a series of incremental decisions that only cohere into a
                    recognisable pattern – or ‘strategy’ – after some time.
                        There are two advantages to our opening definition of strategy. First, the long-term direc-
                    tion of an organisation can include both deliberate, logical strategy and more incremental,
                    emergent patterns of strategy. Second, long-term direction can include both strategies that
                    emphasise difference and competition, and strategies that recognise the roles of cooperation
                    and even imitation.
                        The three elements of this strategy definition – the long term, direction and organisation –
                    can each be explored further. The strategy of Tesla Motors illustrates important points (see
                    Illustration 1.1):

                    • The long term. Strategies are typically measured over years, for some organisations a
                      decade or more. The importance of a long-term perspective on strategy is emphasised
                      by the ‘three horizons’ framework shown in Figure 1.3. The three-horizons framework
                      suggests organisations should think of their businesses or activities in terms of
                      different ‘horizons’, defined by time. Horizon 1 businesses are basically the current core
                      activities. In the case of Tesla Motors, Horizon 1 includes the original Tesla Roadster car
                      and subsequent models. Horizon 1 businesses need defending and extending but the
                      expectation is that in the long term they risk becoming flat or declining in terms of profits
                      (or whatever else the organisation values). Horizon 2 businesses are emerging activities
                      that should provide new future sources of profit. For Tesla, that might include the new
                      mega-battery business. Finally, there are Horizon 3 possibilities, which are more open
                      and for which outcomes are even more uncertain. These are typically risky research and
                      development projects, start-up ventures, test-market pilots or similar: at Tesla, these might
                      be further solar electric initiatives, rockets and space transportation. For a fast-moving
                      organisation like Tesla, Horizon 3 might generate profits a few years from the present
                      time. In a pharmaceutical company, where the R&D and regulatory processes for a new
                      drug take many years, Horizon 3 might be a decade ahead. While timescales might differ,
                      as industries and types of firm can move at different rates, the basic point about the ‘three
                      horizons’ framework is that managers need to avoid focusing on the short-term issues of
                      their existing activities. Strategy involves pushing out Horizon 1 as far as possible, at the
                      same time as looking to Horizons 2 and 3.

Chapter 1 Introducing strategy


                    • Strategic direction. Over the years, strategies follow some kind of long-term direction
                      or trajectory. The strategic direction of Tesla Motors is from the original electric car to a
                      diversified set of solar power offerings. Sometimes a strategic direction only emerges as
                      a coherent pattern over time. Typically, however, managers and entrepreneurs try to set
                      the direction of their strategy according to long-term objectives. In private-sector busi-
                      nesses, the objective guiding strategic direction is usually maximising profits for share-
                      holders. However, profits do not always set strategic direction. First, public-sector and
                      charity organisations may set their strategic direction according to other objectives: for
                      example, a sports club’s objective may be to move up from one league to a higher one.
                      Second, even in the private sector profit is not always the sole criterion for strategy. Thus
                      family businesses may sometimes sacrifice the maximisation of profits for family object-
                      ives, for example passing down the management of the business to the next generation.
                      The objectives behind strategic direction always need close scrutiny.
                    • Organisation. In this book, organisations are not treated as discrete, unified entities.
                      Organisations involve many relationships, both internally and externally. This is because
                      organisations typically have many internal and external stakeholders, in other words
                      people and groups that depend on the organisation and upon which the organisation
                      itself depends. Internally, organisations are filled with people, typically with diverse,
                      competing and more or less reasonable views of what should be done. At Tesla, co-founder
                      and original CEO Eberhard was fired by new Chairman Elon Musk. In strategy, therefore, it
                      is always important to look inside organisations and to consider the people involved and
                      their different interests and views. Externally, organisations are surrounded by important
                      relationships, for example with suppliers, customers, alliance partners, regulators and
                      investors. For Tesla, relationships with investors and advertisers are crucial. Strategy, there-
                      fore, is also vitally concerned with an organisation’s external boundaries: in other words,
                      questions about what to include within the organisation and how to manage important
                      relationships with what is kept outside.

                        Because strategy typically involves managing people, relationships and resources, the
                    subject is sometimes called ‘strategic management’. This book takes the view that managing
                    is always important in strategy. Good strategy is about the practicalities of managing as well
                    as the analysis of strategising.


                    1.2.2 The purpose of strategy: mission, vision, values
                          and objectives
                    What is a strategy for? Harvard University’s Cynthia Montgomery5 argues that the core of
                    a strategist’s job is defining and expressing a clear and motivating purpose for the organ-
                    isation. Even for private-sector organisations this is generally more than simple profit-
                    maximisation as long-term prosperity and employee motivation usually require expressions
                    of purpose that go beyond just profits. According to Montgomery, the stated purpose of the
                    organisation should address two related questions: how does the organisation make a differ-
                    ence; and for whom does the organisation make that difference? If the stakeholders of an
                    organisation can relate to such a purpose it can be highly motivating. Indeed, research by Jim
                    Collins and Jerry Porras suggests that the long-run success of many US corporations – such
                    as Disney, General Electric or 3M – can be attributed (at least in part) to the clear guidance
                    and motivation offered by such statements of purpose.6
                       There are four ways in which organisations typically define their purpose:

                    • A mission statement aims to provide employees and stakeholders with clarity about
                      what the organisation is fundamentally there to do. This is often expressed in the


8
                                                                            1.2 What is strategy?


  apparently simple but challenging question: ‘What business are we in?’ Two linked ques-
  tions that can clarify an organisation’s ‘business’ are: ‘What would be lost if the organisa-
  tion did not exist?’; and ‘How do we make a difference?’ Though they do not use the term
  ‘mission statement’, Collins and Porras7 suggest that understanding the fundamental
  mission can be done by starting with a descriptive statement of what the organisation
  actually does, then repeatedly delving deeper into the organisation’s purpose by asking
  ‘why do we do this?’ They use the example of managers in a gravel and asphalt company
  arriving at the conclusion that its mission is to make people’s lives better by improving
  the quality of built structures. At the University of Utrecht the mission includes educating
  students, training the next generation of researchers and addressing social issues.
• A vision statement is concerned with the future the organisation seeks to create. The
  vision typically expresses an aspiration that will enthuse, gain commitment and stretch
  performance. So here the question is: ‘What do we want to achieve?’ Porras and Collins
  suggest managers can identify this by asking: ‘If we were sitting here in twenty years what
  do we want to have created or achieved?’ They cite the example of Henry Ford’s original
  vision in the very early days of automobile production that the ownership of a car should
  be within the reach of everyone. For the Swedish music site Spotify, the vision is to become
  ‘the Operating System of music’, a universal platform for listening just as Microsoft is for
  office software.
• Statements of corporate values communicate the underlying and enduring core ‘prin-
  ciples’ that guide an organisation’s strategy and define the way that the organisa-
  tion should operate. For example, Alphabet (previously Google), famously includes in its
  values ‘you can be serious without a suit’, ‘fast is better than slow’ and ‘don’t be evil’. It
  is important that these values are enduring, so a question to ask is: ‘Would these values
  change with circumstances?’ And if the answer is ‘yes’ then they are not ‘core’ and not
  ‘enduring’. An example is the importance of leading-edge research in some universities.
  Whatever the constraints on funding, such universities hold to the enduring centrality of
  research. On the other hand, as Alphabet has grown and diversified, some critics wonder
  whether the company still abides by its principle of ‘don’t be evil’ (see Chapter 13 end case).
• Objectives are statements of specific outcomes that are to be achieved. These are often
  expressed in precise financial terms, for instance, the level of sales, profits or share valu-
  ation in one, two or three years’ time.8 Organisations may also have quantifiable market-
  based objectives, such as market share, customer service, repeat business and so on.
  Sometimes objectives focus on the basis of competitive advantage: for example, low-cost
  airlines such as RyanAir set objectives on turnaround time for their aircraft because
  this is at the core of their distinctive low-cost advantage. Increasingly organisations are
  also setting objectives referred to as ‘the triple bottom line’, by which is meant not only
  economic objectives such as those above, but also environmental and social objectives to
  do with their corporate responsibility to wider society (see Section 5.4).

   Although visions, missions and values may be liable to become bland and too wide-
ranging,9 they can offer more enduring sources of direction and motivation than the concrete
nature of objectives. It is therefore crucial that vision, mission and values are meaningful
when included in strategy statements.


1.2.3 Strategy statements
David Collis and Michael Rukstad10 at the Harvard Business School argue that all entrepre-
neurs and managers should be able to summarise their organisation’s strategy with a ‘strategy
statement’. Strategy statements should have three main themes: the fundamental goals


                                                                                               9
Chapter 1 Introducing strategy


                    (mission, vision or objectives) that the organisation seeks; the scope or domain of the
                    organisation’s activities; and the particular advantages or capabilities it has to deliver
                    all of these.
                        Mission, vision and objectives have been described above in 1.2.2 so here we concentrate
                    on the other two main themes, scope and advantage, with examples of all three given in
                    Illustration 1.2:

                    • Scope. An organisation’s scope or domain refers to three dimensions: customers or clients;
                      geographical location; and extent of internal activities (‘vertical integration’). For a univer-
                      sity, scope questions are twofold: first, which academic departments to have (a business
                      school, an engineering department and so on); second, which activities to do internally
                      themselves (vertically integrate) and which to externalise to subcontractors (for example,
                      whether to manage campus restaurants in-house or to subcontract them).
                    • Advantage. This part of a strategy statement describes how the organisation will achieve
                      the objectives it has set for itself in its chosen domain. In competitive environments, this
                      refers to the competitive advantage: for example, how a particular company or sports club
                      will achieve goals in the face of competition from other companies or clubs. The organ-
                      isation needs to be better than others at achieving its particular goal. In the public sector,
                      advantage might refer simply to the organisation’s capability in general. But even public-
                      sector organisations frequently need to show that their capabilities are not only adequate,
                      but superior to other rival departments or perhaps to private-sector contractors.

                        Collis and Rukstad suggest that strategy statements covering goals, scope and advan-
                    tage should be no more than 35 words long. The three themes are deliberately made highly
                    concise. Brevity keeps such statements focused on the essentials and makes them easy to
                    remember and communicate. Thus for Tesla, a strategy statement might be: ‘To accelerate
                    the advent of a sustainable solar economy by developing and incorporating superior battery-
                    based technologies into compelling mass market electric products and bringing them to
                    market as soon as possible.’ The IKEA business idea is a little more specific: ‘To create a better
                    everyday life for the many people [by offering] a wide range of well-designed, functional
                    home furnishing products at prices so low that as many people as possible will be able to
                    afford them.’ Of course, such strategy statements are not always fulfilled. Circumstances may
                    change in unexpected ways. In the meantime, however, they can provide a useful guide both
                    to managers in their decision-making and to employees and others who need to understand
                    the direction in which the organisation is going. The ability to give a clear strategy statement
                    is a good test of managerial competence in an organisation.
                        As such, strategy statements are relevant to a wide range of organisations. For example, a
                    small entrepreneurial start-up can use a strategy statement to persuade investors and lenders
                    of its viability. Public-sector organisations need strategy statements not only for themselves,
                    but to reassure clients, funders and regulators that their priorities are the right ones. Volun-
                    tary organisations need persuasive strategy statements in order to inspire volunteers and
                    donors. Thus organisations of all kinds frequently publish materials relevant to such strategy
                    statements on their websites or annual reports. Illustration 1.2 provides published materials
                    on the strategies of two very different organisations: the technology giant Samsung from
                    the private sector and York University in the UK from the public sector.

                    1.2.4 Levels of strategy
                    So far we have considered an organisation as a whole, but inside an organisation, strategies
                    can exist at three main levels.

                    • Corporate-level strategy is concerned with the overall scope of an organisation
                      and how value is added to the constituent businesses of the organisational whole.
                      Corporate-level strategy issues include geographical scope, diversity of products or
                      services, acquisitions of new businesses, and how resources are allocated between the
                      different elements of the organisation. For Tesla, moving from car manufacture to battery
                      production for homes and businesses is a corporate-level strategy. Being clear about
                      corporate-level strategy is important: determining the range of businesses to include is
                      the basis of other strategic decisions, such as acquisitions and alliances.
                    • Business-level strategy is about how the individual businesses should compete in
                      their particular markets (this is often called ‘competitive strategy’). These might be
                      stand-alone businesses, for instance entrepreneurial start-ups, or ‘business units’ within
                      a larger corporation. Business-level strategy typically concerns issues such as innovation,
                      appropriate scale and response to competitors’ moves. For Tesla this means rolling out a
                      lower cost electric car to build volume and capture market share in advance of potential
                      competitor entry. In the public sector, the equivalent of business-level strategy is deci-
                      sions about how units (such as individual hospitals or schools) should provide best-value
                      services. Where the businesses are units within a larger organisation, business-level strat-
                      egies should clearly fit with corporate-level strategy.
                    • Functional strategies are concerned with how the components of an organisation
                      deliver effectively the corporate- and business-level strategies in terms of resources,
                      processes and people. For example, Tesla continues to raise external finance to fund its
                      rapid growth: its functional strategy is partly geared to meeting investment needs. In most
                      businesses, successful business strategies depend to a large extent on decisions that are
                      taken, or activities that occur, at the functional level. Functional decisions need there-
                      fore to be closely linked to business-level strategy. They are vital to successful strategy
                      implementation.

                       This need to link the corporate, business and functional levels underlines the importance
                    of integration in strategy. Each level needs to be aligned with the others. The demands of
                    integrating levels define an important characteristic of strategy: strategy is typically complex,
                    requiring careful and sensitive management. Strategy is rarely simple.



1.3 The Exploring Strategy Framework
                    In order to help you to evaluate an organisation’s strategy, this book provides a three-part
                    framework that emphasises the interconnected nature of strategic issues. The Exploring
                    Strategy Framework includes understanding the strategic position of an organisation;
                    assessing strategic choices for the future; and managing strategy in action. Figure 1.4
                    shows these elements and defines the broad coverage of this book. Together, the three
                    elements provide you with a practical template for studying strategic situations. The
                    following sections of this chapter will introduce the strategic issues that arise under each of
                    these elements of the Exploring Strategy Framework. But first it is important to understand
                    why the framework is drawn in this particular way.

                                                                    1.3 The Exploring Strategy Framework


   Figure 1.4 could have shown the framework’s three elements in a linear sequence – first
understanding the strategic position, then making strategic choices and finally turning
strategy into action. Indeed, this logical sequence is implicit in the definition of strategy given
by Alfred Chandler (Figure 1.2) and many other textbooks on strategy. However, as Henry
Mintzberg recognises, in practice the elements of strategy do not always follow this linear
sequence. Choices often have to be made before the position is fully understood. Sometimes
too a proper understanding of the strategic position can only be built from the experience
of trying a strategy out in action. The real-world feedback from launching a new product is
often far better at uncovering the true strategic position than remote analysis carried out in
a strategic planning department at head office.
   The interconnected circles of Figure 1.4 are designed to emphasise this potentially
non-linear nature of strategy. Position, choices and action should be seen as closely related,
and in practice none has priority over another. Although the book divides its subject matter
into three sections in sequence, this does not mean that the process of strategy must follow
a logical series of distinct steps. The three circles are overlapping and interdependent. The
evidence provided in later chapters will suggest that strategy rarely occurs in tidy ways and
that it is better not to expect it to do so.
   However, the Exploring Strategy Framework does provide you with a comprehensive and
integrated framework for analysing an organisation’s position. It allows you to consider the
choices it has and how strategies might be put into action. You can use each of the chap-
ters to help you ask fundamental strategy questions and to select essential concepts and
techniques that will help you answer them. Working systematically through questions and
answers will provide you with the basis for persuasive strategy recommendations.

Chapter 1 Introducing strategy


                    1.3.1 Strategic position
                    The strategic position is concerned with the impact on strategy of the external environ-
                    ment, the organisation’s strategic resources and capabilities, the organisation’s goals and
                    the organisation’s culture. Understanding these four factors is central for evaluating future
                    strategy. These issues, and the fundamental questions associated with them, are covered in
                    the four chapters of Part I of this book:

                    • Strategic purpose. Most organisations claim for themselves a particular purpose, as encap-
                      sulated in their vision, mission, values and objectives. These may be captured in a key
                      strategy tool, the Strategy Statement. But often an organisation’s purpose is unclear,
                      contested or unrealistic. Chapter 1 explains the components of a strategy statement and
                      allows you to analyse an organisation’s strategic purpose and ask ‘what does it seek to
                      achieve?’ The three-horizons framework will also allow you to assess the sustainability of
                      an organisation’s strategy.
                    • Macro-environment. Organisations operate in complex multi-level environments. At the
                      macro level organisations are influenced by political, economic, social, technological,
                      ecological and legal forces. These may present both opportunities and threats for organ-
                      isations. Chapter 2 contains key frameworks such as PESTLE, forecasting approaches and
                      scenario cube to help you assess key drivers of change in the macro context that may affect
                      organisations and their industries.
                    • Industry and sector. At the industry level competitors, customers and suppliers also present
                      challenges. These environments vary widely in terms of their competitive pressures and
                      overall attractiveness and may present further opportunities and threats to the organ-
                      isation. Key frameworks such as Porter’s Five Forces, industry life cycle, strategic groups,
                      strategy canvas are all reviewed in detail with supporting examples in Chapter 3 to
                      help you focus your analysis on priority issues in the face of contextual complexity and
                      dynamism.
                    • Resources and capabilities. Each organisation has its own strategic resources (e.g. machines
                      and buildings) and capabilities (e.g. technical and managerial skills) that support its posi-
                      tion in a market. The fundamental question on capability regards the organisation’s
                      strengths and weaknesses (for example, where is it at a competitive advantage or disad-
                      vantage?). Are the organisation’s capabilities adequate to the challenges of its environ-
                      ment and the demands of its goals? The key frameworks of VRIO, value chain, activity
                      systems and SWOT are all described in detail with examples in Chapter 4 to enable you to
                      analyse such resources and capabilities.
                    • Stakeholders and governance. The wishes of key stakeholders should define the purpose
                      of an organisation. Here the issue of corporate governance is important: how to ensure
                      that managers stick to the agreed purpose. Questions of purpose and accountability raise
                      issues of corporate social responsibility and ethics: is the purpose of an organisation an
                      appropriate one and are managers sticking to it? Techniques that enable you to iden-
                      tify stakeholders, assess their relative importance through the use of a power/attention
                      matrix, and identify the chain of corporate governance are described in Chapter 5.
                    • History and culture. Organisational cultures can also influence strategy. So can the cultures
                      of a particular industry or particular country. These cultures are typically a product of
                      an organisation’s history. The consequence of history and culture can be strategic drift,
                      a failure to create necessary change. A fundamental question here, therefore, is: how
                      does culture fit with the required strategy? Chapter 6 demonstrates how you can analyse,
                      challenge and even turn to your advantage the various cultural influences on strategy by
                      recognising different layers of culture and using the cultural web analysis

    The Exploring Strategy Framework (Illustration 1.1) points to the following positioning
issues for Tesla Motors. What is the future of the company given the growing social, economic
and political demands for businesses to be environmentally sustainable? Are its distinctive
capabilities really valued sufficiently by consumers to provide a financial return to investors
and to allow sustained investment in further innovative products? How will Tesla cope with
rising competition from car industry giants that are now selling electric and hybrid cars?


1.3.2 Strategic choices
Strategic choices involve the options for strategy in terms of both the directions in which
strategy might move and the methods by which strategy might be pursued. For instance,
an organisation might have a range of strategic directions open to it: the organisation could
diversify into new products; it could enter new international markets; or it could transform its
existing products and markets through radical innovation. These various directions could be
pursued by different methods: the organisation could acquire a business already active in the
product or market area; it could form alliances with relevant organisations that might help
its new strategy; or it could try to pursue its strategies on its own. Typical strategic choices,
and the related fundamental questions, are covered in the five chapters that make up Part
II of this book, as follows:

• Business strategy and models. There are strategic choices in terms of how the organ-
  isation seeks to compete at the individual business level. For example, a business unit
  could choose to be the lowest cost competitor in a market, or the highest quality. The
  fundamental question here, then, is what strategy, and what business model, should a
  company use to compete? To help you decide, Chapter 7 explains the classic generic strat-
  egies framework, the Strategy Clock, a key business model components framework and
  common business models. Key dilemmas for business-level strategy, and ways of resolving
  them, are also discussed.
• Corporate strategy and diversification. The highest level of an organisation is typically
  concerned with issues of corporate scope; in other words, which businesses to include
  in the portfolio. This relates to the appropriate degree of diversification, with regard to
  products offered and markets served. Corporate-level strategy is also concerned both with
  internal relationships, both between business units and with the corporate head-office.
  Chapter 8 provides you with the corporate strategy directions framework, the BCG model,
  the directional policy framework and the parenting matrix to help you assess diversifica-
  tion strategies and the appropriate relationships within the corporate portfolio.
• International strategy. Internationalisation is a form of diversification, but into new
  geographical markets. Here the fundamental question is: where internationally should
  the organisation compete? Chapter 9 shows you how to prioritise various international
  options and key strategies for pursuing them, using an internationalisation drivers frame-
  work, Porter’s Diamond, a global integration and local responsiveness matrix, the CAGE
  framework, an international cross-comparison cultural model, an international compet-
  itor retaliation framework and a subsidiary roles in multinational firms matrix.
• Entrepreneurship and innovation. Most existing organisations have to innovate constantly
  simply to survive. Entrepreneurship, the creation of a new enterprise, is an act of innova-
  tion too. A fundamental question, therefore, is whether the organisation is innovating
  appropriately. Chapter 10 helps you make choices about entrepreneurship and innova-
  tion. It shows how to make those choices based on an entrepreneurial opportunity recog-
  nition model, steps in the entrepreneurial process framework, evaluating entrepreneurial
  growth stages and innovation dilemmas models, the diffusion S-curve, the disruptive inno-
  vation model and the portfolio of innovation options framework.

                                                                                              15
Chapter 1 Introducing strategy


                    • Mergers, acquisitions and alliances. Organisations have to make choices about methods
                      for pursuing their strategies. Many organisations prefer to build new businesses with their
                      own resources. Other organisations develop by acquiring other businesses or forming alli-
                      ances with complementary partners. The fundamental question in Chapter 11, therefore,
                      is whether to buy another company, ally or to go it alone. To help you make this choice the
                      chapter contains an M&A process model, a post-acquisition matrix, a strategic alliances
                      motives figure, an alliance evolution model and a buy, ally or DIY decision tree.

                       Again, issues of strategic choice are live in the case of Tesla Motors (Illustration 1.1).
                    The Exploring Strategy Framework asks the following kinds of questions here. Should
                    Tesla continue to produce new higher volume cheaper cars or remain specialised? How far
                    should it widen the scope of its businesses: is producing batteries for homes really helping
                    or detracting from car production? Where should Tesla innovate next?


                    1.3.3 Strategy in action
                    Managing strategy in action is about how strategies are formed and how they are
                    implemented. The emphasis is on the practicalities of managing. These issues are covered
                    in the five chapters of Part III, and include the following, each with their own fundamental
                    questions:

                    • Evaluating strategies. Managers have to decide whether existing and forecast perform-
                      ance is satisfactory and then choose between options that might improve it. The funda-
                      mental evaluation questions are as follows: are the options suitable in terms of matching
                      opportunities and threats; are they acceptable in the eyes of significant stakeholders;
                      and are they feasible given the capabilities available? Chapter 12 introduces a range of
                      financial and non-financial techniques to help you appraise performance and evaluate
                      strategic options. To begin with the SAFE framework provides criteria for evaluating stra-
                      tegic performance, followed by many techniques including gap analysis, decision trees,
                      ROCE, DCF, sensitivity analysis, cost–benefit assessment, shareholder value analysis and
                      real options.
                    • Strategy development processes. Strategies are often developed through formal planning
                      processes. But sometimes the strategies an organisation actually pursues are emergent –
                      in other words, accumulated patterns of ad hoc decisions, bottom-up initiatives and rapid
                      responses to the unanticipated. Given the scope for emergence, the fundamental ques-
                      tion is: what kind of strategy process should an organisation have? Chapter 13 helps you
                      to address the question of whether to plan strategy in detail or leave plenty of oppor-
                      tunities for emergence by showing how deliberate and emergent strategies develop, by
                      providing you with a strategic direction model and a strategy development in different
                      contexts framework.
                    • Organising and strategy. Once a strategy is developed, the organisation needs to organise
                      for successful implementation. Each strategy requires its own specific configuration of
                      structures and systems. The fundamental question, therefore, is: what kinds of structures
                      and systems are required for the chosen strategy? To help you answer this question,
                      Chapter 14 provides you with models of functional, multidivisional, matrix and multi-
                      national structures, a strategy styles matrix, a strategy map and the McKinsey 7-S.
                    • Leadership and strategic change. In a dynamic world, strategy inevitably involves change.
                      Managing change involves leadership, both at the top of the organisation and lower
                      down. There is not just one way of leading change, however: there are different styles

                                                                               1.3 The Exploring Strategy Framework


                        and different levers for change. So the fundamental question is: how should the organ-
                        isation manage necessary changes entailed by the strategy? Chapter 15 therefore helps
                        you to identify the drivers for change in the change kaleidoscope framework, examine
                        options for managing change with the styles of leadership matrix, the forcefield analysis
                        model and Kotter’s Eight Steps of Change Model, and considers how to choose between
                        them with the types of change framework.
                      • The practice of strategy. Inside the broad processes of strategy development and change
                        is a lot of hard, detailed work. The fundamental question in managing this work is:
                        who should do what in the strategy process? Chapter 16 thus helps you to understand
                        which people to include in the process with the ‘Who to include in Strategy Making?’
                        Matrix; what activities practitioners should do, such as using the formal channels for
                        issue-selling model; and which methodologies can help them do it, such as a hypoth-
                        esis testing approach. These kinds of practicalities are a fitting end to the book and
                        essential equipment for those who will have to go out and participate in strategy work
                        themselves.

                         With regard to strategy in action, the Exploring Strategy Framework raises the following
                      kinds of questions for Tesla. How will Tesla return value to shareholders going forwards?
                      How will the rate of innovation at Tesla be maintained? Should Tesla move towards a more
                      disciplined strategy development process rather than depend on the vision of Elon Musk?
                      Does Tesla need more structure and systems? As Tesla grows, how should any changes that
                      may be necessary be managed?
                         Thus the Exploring Strategy Framework offers you a comprehensive way for analysing an
                      organisation’s position, considering alternative choices, and selecting and implementing
                      strategies. This review of the main elements of the framework now allows us to refine and
                      extend our earlier broad definition of strategy in Section 2.1 to state that ‘Strategy is the
                      long term direction of an organisation, formed by choices and actions about its resources
                      and scope, in order to create advantageous positions relative to competitors and peers
                      in changing environmental and stakeholder contexts’. This definition and each chapter
                      provide a comprehensive checklist for strategy. These fundamental questions are summed
                      up in Table 1.1. Any assessment of an organisation’s strategy will benefit from asking these
                      questions systematically. The frameworks for answering these and related questions can be
                      found in the respective chapters.

Chapter 1 Introducing strategy


                       The logic of the Exploring Strategy Framework can be applied to our personal lives as
                    much as to organisations. We all have to make decisions with long-run consequences for our
                    futures and the issues involved are very similar. For example, in pursuing a career strategy,
                    a job-seeker needs to understand the job market, evaluate their strengths and weaknesses,
                    establish the range of job opportunities and decide what their career goals really are (posi-
                    tioning issues). The job-seeker then narrows down the options, makes some applications
                    and finally gets an offer (choice issues). Once the job-seeker has chosen a job, he or she sets
                    to work, adjusting their skills and behaviours to suit their new role (strategy in action). Just
                    as in the non-linear, overlapping Exploring Strategy Framework, experience of the job will
                    frequently amend the original strategic goals. Putting a career strategy into action produces
                    better understanding of strengths and weaknesses and frequently leads to the setting of
                    new career goals.



1.4 Working with strategy
                    Strategy itself is a kind of work that almost all levels of management have to engage in
                    and this is often co-evolved with powerful external stakeholders such as investors, regu-
                    lators and advisers, and even media. Within organisations it is not just the preserve of top
                    decision-makers but middle and lower-level managers also have to understand their organ-
                    isation’s strategic objectives and contribute to them as best they can. Managers have to
                    communicate strategy to their teams, and will achieve greater performance from them the
                    more convincing they are in doing so. Indeed, as responsibility is increasingly decentralised
                    in many organisations, middle and lower-level managers play a growing part in shaping
                    strategy themselves. Because they are closer to the daily realities of the business, lower-level
                    managers can be a crucial source of ideas and feedback for senior management teams.
                    Being able to participate in an organisation’s ‘strategic conversation’ – engaging with senior
                    managers on the big issues facing them – is therefore often part of what it takes to win
                    promotion.11
                       For many managers, then, strategy is part of the job. However, there are specialist strat-
                    egists as well, in both private and public sectors. Many large organisations have in-house
                    strategic planning or analyst roles.12 Typically requiring a formal business education of
                    some sort, strategic planning is a potential career route for many readers of this book, espe-
                    cially after some functional experience. Strategy consulting has been a growth industry
                    in the last decades, with the original leading firms such as McKinsey & Co., the Boston
                    Consulting Group and Bain joined now by more generalist consultants such as Accen-
                    ture, IBM Consulting and PwC, each with its own strategy consulting arm.13 Again, busi-
                    ness graduates are in demand for strategy consulting roles, such as that of Claudia in the
                    opening example.14
                       The interviews in Illustration 1.3 give some insights into the different kinds of strategy work
                    that managers and strategy specialists can do. Galina, the manager of an international subsid-
                    iary, Chantal, a strategy consultant, and Harminder, heading a strategy office in a not-for-
                    profit organisation all have different experiences of strategy, but there are some common
                    themes also. All find strategy work stimulating and rewarding. The two specialists, Chantal
                    and Harminder, talk more than Galina of analytical tools such as scenario analysis, sensitivity
                    analysis and hypothesis testing. Galina discovered directly the practical challenges of real-
                    world strategic planning, having to adapt the plan during the first few years in the United
                    Kingdom. She emphasises the importance of flexibility in strategy and the value of getting her
                    managers to see the ‘whole picture’ through involving them in strategy-making. But Chantal

                                                                                       1.5 Studying strategy


          and Harminder too are concerned with much more than just analysis. Chantal emphasises the
          importance of gaining ‘traction’ with clients, building consensus in order to ensure implemen-
          tation. Harminder also realises that delivering recommendations is just the beginning of the
          strategy process and getting buy-in from key stakeholders is critical for implementation. He
          sees strategy and delivery as intimately connected, with people involved in delivery needing
          an understanding of strategy to be effective, and strategists needing to understand delivery.
             Strategy, therefore, is not just about abstract organisations. It is about linking analysis with
          implementation on the ground. It is complex work that real people do. An important aim of
          this book is to equip readers to do this work better.



1.5 Studying strategy
          This book is both comprehensive and serious about strategy. To understand the full range of
          strategy issues – from analysis to action – it is important to be open to the perspectives and
          insights of key disciplines such as economics, finance, marketing, sociology and psychology.
          To be serious about strategy means to draw as far as possible on rigorous research about
          these issues. This book aims for an evidence-based approach to strategy, hence the articles
          and books referenced at the end of each chapter.15
              This book therefore covers equally the three main branches of strategy research: conven-
          tionally, these are known as strategy context, strategy content and strategy process. In terms
          of the Exploring Strategy Framework (Figure 1.4), context broadly relates to positioning,
          content to choice and process to action. Each of these branches contains various research
          streams whose lessons can be readily applied to practical questions of strategy issues.
          Figure 1.5 shows the three branches and their respective research streams: these are listed
          in the approximate historical order of their emergence as strong research streams, the arrows
          representing the continuously developing nature of each. In more detail, the three branches
          and the characteristic analytical approaches of their main research streams are as follows:

          • Strategy context refers to multiple layers of environment, internal and external to organ-
            isations. All organisations need to take into account the opportunities and threats of
            their external environments. Macro-environmental analysis has been an enduring theme
            in strategy with early recognition of multiple pressures upon industries in the 1960s.

  Subsequently researchers have focused upon various additional themes including insti-
  tutional pressures establishing the ‘rules of the game’ within which companies operate.
  Industry analysis took off as a research tradition in the early 1980s, when Michael Porter
  showed how the tools of economics could be applied to understanding what makes indus-
  tries attractive (or unattractive) to operate in.16 From the 1980s too, cultural analysts have
  used sociological insights into human behaviour to point to the importance of shared
  cultural understandings about appropriate ways of acting. In the internal context, cultural
  analysts show that strategies are often influenced by the organisation’s specific culture.
  In the external context, they show how strategies often have to fit with the surrounding
  industry or national cultures. Resource-based view researchers focus on internal context,
  looking for the unique characteristics of each organisation.17 According to the resource-
  based view, the economic analysis of market imperfections, the psychological analysis of
  perceptual or emotional biases, and the sociological analysis of organisational cultures
  should reveal the particular characteristics (resources) that contribute to an organisation’s
  specific competitive advantages and disadvantages.

• Strategy content concerns the content (or nature) of different strategies and their prob-
  ability of success. Here the focus is on the merits of different strategic options. Strategy and
  performance researchers started by using economic analysis to understand the success of
  different types of diversification strategies. This research continues as the enduring central
  core of the strategy discipline, with an ever-growing list of issues addressed. For example,
  contemporary strategy and performance researchers examine various new innovation
  strategies, different kinds of internationalisation and all the complex kinds of alliance
  and networking strategies organisations adopt today. These researchers typically bring
  a tough economic scrutiny to strategy options. Their aim is to establish which types of
  strategies pay best and under what conditions. They refuse to take for granted broad
  generalisations about what makes a good strategy.
• Strategy process, broadly conceived, examines how strategies are formed and imple-
  mented. Research here provides a range of insights to help managers in the practical
  processes of managing strategy.18 From the 1960s, researchers in the strategic planning
  tradition have drawn from economics and management science in order to design rational
  and analytical systems for the planning and implementing of strategy. However, strategy
  involves people: since the 1980s, choice and change researchers have been pointing to how
  the psychology of human perception and emotions, and the sociology of group politics
  and interests, tend to undermine rational analysis.19 The advice of these researchers is
  to accept the irrational, messy realities of organisations, and to work with them, rather
  than to try to impose textbook rationality. Finally, strategy-as-practice researchers have
  recently been using micro-sociological approaches to closely examine the human real-
  ities of formal and informal strategy processes.20 This tradition focuses attention on how
  people do strategy work, and the importance of having the right tools and skills.

    From the above, it should be clear that studying strategy involves perspectives and insights
from a range of academic disciplines. Issues need to be ‘explored’ from different points of
view. A strategy chosen purely on economic grounds can easily be undermined by psycho-
logical and sociological factors. On the other hand, a strategy that is chosen on the psycho-
logical grounds of emotional enthusiasm, or for sociological reasons of cultural acceptability,
is liable to fail if not supported by favourable economics. As underlined by the four strategy
lenses to be introduced later, one perspective is rarely enough for good strategy. A complete
analysis will typically need the insights of economics, psychology and sociology.

1.6 Exploring strategy further
                    So far we have stressed that strategic issues are typically complex, best explored from a
                    number of points of view. There is no simple, universal rule for good strategy. This section
                    introduces two further ways of exploring strategy: one depending on context, the other
                    depending on perspective.


                    1.6.1 Exploring strategy in different contexts
                    Although the basic elements of the Exploring Strategy Framework are relevant in most
                    circumstances, how they play out precisely is likely to differ according to organisational
                    contexts. To return to Illustration 1.2, both Samsung and York University share some funda-
                    mental issues about how to compete and what activities they should have in their portfolio.
                    However, for a Korean electronics company and a British university, the role of institutions,
                    particularly government, varies widely, affecting the freedom to choose and the ability to
                    change. In applying the Exploring Strategy Framework, it is therefore useful to ask what kinds
                    of issues are likely to be particularly significant in the specific context being considered. To
                    illustrate, this section shows how issues arising from the Exploring Strategy Framework can
                    vary in three important organisational contexts.

                    • Start-ups and small businesses. With regard to positioning, small businesses will certainly
                      need to attend closely to the environment, because they are so vulnerable to change. But,
                      especially in small entrepreneurial businesses, strategic purpose will be a determining
                      issue: for instance this may not necessarily just be profit, but might include objectives such
                      as remaining independent and maybe even a pleasant lifestyle. The range of strategic
                      choices is likely to be narrower than for larger businesses: for a small business acquisi-
                      tions may not be affordable, though they may have to decide whether to allow them-
                      selves to be acquired. Some issues of strategy in action will be different; for example
                      strategic change processes will not involve the same challenges as for large, complex
                      organisations.
                    • Multinational corporations. In this context, positioning in a complex global marketplace
                      will be very important. Each significant geographical market may call for a separate
                      analysis of the business environment. Likewise, operating in many different countries will
                      raise positioning issues of culture: variations in national culture imply different demands
                      in the marketplace and different managerial styles internally. Strategic choices are likely to
                      be dominated by international strategy questions about which geographical markets to
                      serve. The scale and geographical reach of most multinationals point to significant issues
                      for strategy in action, particularly those of organisational structure and strategic change.
                    • Family businesses. These firms vary widely in size and scope so their positioning issues will
                      range widely depending upon competitive strength in their industry. However, this may not
                      be the most important positioning issue as strategic purpose may be a defining issue. For
                      instance, profit may not be of foremost consideration as objectives such as family control,
                      handing over to the next generation and maybe even a pleasant lifestyle may be regarded
                      as of greater importance. Depending on the size of the family business, resource constraints
                      may or may not be a limiting issue in terms of strategic options but for large initiatives such
                      as making an acquisition, or being acquired, family concerns will probably be uppermost in
                      decision makers’ minds. In terms of strategy in action, family businesses are likely to need
                      to deal with particular complexities around strategic change and leadership.

• Public sector and not-for-profits. Positioning issues of competitive advantage will be
  important even in these contexts, but have a different flavour. Charitable not-for-profits
  typically compete for funds from donors; public-sector organisations, such as schools and
  hospitals, often compete on measures such as quality or service. The positioning issue of
  purpose is likely to be very important too. In the absence of a clear, focused objective such
  as profit, purpose in the public sector and not-for-profits can be ambiguous and conten-
  tious. Strategic choice issues may be narrower than in the private sector: for example,
  there may be constraints on diversification. Strategy-in-action issues often need close
  attention, leadership and change typically being very challenging in large public-sector
  organisations.

   In short, while drawing on the same basic principles, strategy analysis is likely to vary in
focus across different contexts. As the next section will indicate, it is often helpful therefore
to apply different lenses to strategy problems.



1.6.2 Exploring strategy through different ‘strategy lenses’
Exploring is a distinctive feature of this book and it means being critical of existing approaches
as well as looking for new and different things. In particular, exploring strategy involves
searching for new angles on strategic problems as we believe a comprehensive assessment
of an organisation’s strategy needs more than one perspective. In order to help you build
your awareness of different perspectives on strategy we introduce ‘four strategy lenses’.
These lenses present distinct, theoretically informed perspectives on strategy that enable
you to perceive different ways of perceiving strategy. The four strategy lenses cover ways
of looking at strategy issues differently in order to generate additional insights. These
different perspectives will help you criticise prevailing approaches and raise new issues or
solutions. Thus, although drawn from academic theory, the lenses should also be highly
practical in the job of doing strategy.
   The four strategy lenses consist of:

• Strategy as design, which might be likened to an architect’s approach that is systematic,
  analytical and logical.
• Strategy as experience, which recognises that taken-for-granted assumptions and ways of
  doing things, biases and routines, will influence strategy.
• Strategy as variety, which focuses on new ideas and innovation bubbling up in unpredict-
  able ways in an organisation.
• Strategy as discourse, which focuses upon the ways that managers use language to influ-
  ence strategy making – that strategy talk matters.

   None of these lenses is likely to offer a complete view of a strategic situation. The point of
the lenses is to encourage the exploration of different perspectives: first from one point of
view and then from another. This might help in recognising how otherwise logical strategic
initiatives might be held back by cultural experience, unexpected ideas and self-interested
strategy discourse.
   To appreciate the full value that the four strategy lenses framework brings to your under-
standing of strategy, it is fully described at the end of Part I, after you have had a chance to
work with some key strategy frameworks for analysing strategic position. The four lenses are
revisited after each succeeding section of the book so that you can develop deeper insights
into those sections.

                      Summary
                      • The basic definition of strategy is the long-term direction of an organisation. A more full
                        definition is: ‘Strategy is about the long-term direction of an organisation, formed by
                        choices and actions about its resources and scope, in order to create advantageous posi-
                        tions relative to changing environment and stakeholder contexts.’
                      • The work of strategy is to define and express the purpose of an organisation through its
                        mission, vision, values and objectives.
                      • Ideally a strategy statement should include an organisation’s goals, scope of activities and
                        the advantages or capabilities it brings to these goals and activities.
                      • Corporate-level strategy is concerned with an organisation’s overall scope; business-level
                        strategy is concerned with how to compete; and functional strategy is concerned with how
                        corporate- and business-level strategies are actually delivered.
                      • The Exploring Strategy Framework has three major elements: understanding the strategic
                        position, making strategic choices for the future and managing strategy in action.
                      • Strategy work is done by managers throughout an organisation, as well as specialist stra-
                        tegic planners, and external executives such as strategy consultants and investors.
                      • Research on strategy context, content and process shows how the analytical perspectives
                        of economics, sociology and psychology can all provide practical insights for approaching
                        strategy issues.
                      • Although the fundamentals of strategy may be similar, strategy varies by organisational
                        context, for example small business, multinational or public sector.
                      • The four strategy lenses, of design, experience, variety and discourse, will allow you to
                        critically evaluate strategic issues from a variety of perspectives.

              Part I
The strategic position
  This part explains:
  • How to analyse an organisation’s position in the
    external environment – both macro environment
    and industry or sector environment.
  • How to analyse the determinants of strategic
    capability – resources, capabilities and the
    linkages between them.
  • How to understand an organisation’s purposes,
    taking into account corporate governance,
    stakeholder expectations and business ethics.
  • How to address the role of history and culture in
    determining an organisation’s position.
Introduction to Part I
        This part of the book is concerned with understanding the strategic position of the organisation.
        There are five chapters, organised around two themes. The first theme is the organisation’s strat-
        egic potential, in other words what it can do. The second theme is the organisation’s strategic
        ambitions, what it actually seeks to do, sometimes deliberately and sometimes not so deliberately
        (see Figure I.1).
           Strategic potential is addressed as follows:

        • Chapters 2 and 3 consider how different environments can be more or less rich in oppor-
          tunities or hostile, imposing threats and constraints.
        • Chapter 4 considers how each organisation has its own particular strategic resources and
          capabilities, and how these can enable or constrain strategies.

        Organisational ambitions are addressed in the following two chapters:

        • Chapter 5 is about ambition in terms of the purposes that organisational stakeholders
          seek and the ways in which it is governed.
        • Chapter 6 examines how an organisation’s history and culture may shape the ambitions
          of an organisation, often in taken-for-granted and hard-to-change ways.

           There is an important strategic dilemma that runs through Chapters 2, 3 and 4. How much
        should managers concentrate their attention on the external market position and how much
        should they focus on developing their internal capabilities? On the external side, many argue
        that environmental factors are what matter most to success: strategy development should
        be primarily about seeking attractive opportunities in the marketplace. Those favouring a
        more internal approach, on the other hand, argue that an organisation’s specific strategic
        capabilities should drive strategy. It is from these internal characteristics that distinctive strat-
        egies and superior performance can be built. There can be a real trade-off here. Managers
        who invest time and resources in developing their external market position (perhaps through
        acquiring companies that are potential competitors) have less time and resources to invest in
        managing their internal capabilities (for example, building up research and development).
        The same applies in reverse.
           Chapters 5 and 6 raise another underlying issue. To what extent should managers’ ambi-
        tions for their organisations be considered as free or constrained? Chapter 5 explains how

the expectations of investors, regulators, employees and customers can often influence
strategy. Chapter 6 raises the constraints on managers exercised by organisational history
and culture. Managers may be only partially aware of these kinds of constraints and are often
in danger of underestimating the hidden limits to their ambitions.
   Understanding the extent of managers’ freedom to choose is fundamental to considering
the issues of strategic choice that make up Part II of this book. But first Part I provides a foun-
dation by exploring the question of strategic position.

2.1 Introduction
          Organisations depend upon their environments for their survival. Here environments are being
          understood in their widest sense – to include political, economic, social, technological and
          legal factors as well as ecological ones. These environmental factors supply both opportunities
          and threats. Political factors helped knock 20 per cent off Facebook’s share price when it was
          revealed in 2018 that it had allowed Russian meddling in the American presidential elections
          two years earlier. The clustering of millennials as a social group in high-rent cities has prompted
          the emergence of new co-living businesses, such as Roomi and Bedly, offering cheap and flex-
          ible accommodation. Drone technologies are creating opportunities ranging from audit for
          accounting firms such as Deloitte and Ernst & Young to wildlife protection in Africa. It is clearly
          important that entrepreneurs and managers analyse their environments as carefully as they
          can in order to anticipate and – if possible – take advantage of such environmental changes.
             Environments can be considered in terms of a series of ‘layers’, as summarised in
          Figure 2.1. This chapter focuses on organisations’ macro-environments, the outermost layer.
          The macro-environment consists of broad environmental factors that impact to a greater
          or lesser extent many organisations, industries and sectors. For example, the effects of
          macro-environmental factors such as the Internet, economic growth rates, climate change
          and aging populations go far beyond one industry or sector, impacting a wide-range of
          activities from tourism to agriculture. The industry, or sector, makes up the next layer within
          this broad macro-environment. This layer consists of organisations producing the same sorts
          of products or services, for example the automobile industry or the healthcare sector. The
          third layer is that of specific competitors and markets immediately surrounding organisa-
          tions. For a car company like Nissan, this layer would include competitors such as Ford and
          Volkswagen; for a hospital, competitors would include other hospitals and markets would
          be types of patients. Whereas this chapter focuses on the macro-environment, Chapter 3 will
          analyse industries and sectors and competitors and markets. Chapters 4 and 5 examine the
          individual organisations at the heart of Figure 2.1.

                       Macro-environmental changes can often seem too big, complex or unpredictable for
                   managers to grasp. The result is that changes can creep up on them until it is too late to
                   avoid threats or take advantage of opportunities. Thus many traditional retailers, banks and
                   newspapers were slow to seize the opportunities of the Internet; many oil and steel producers
                   underestimated the potential impact of China’s slowing economic growth. While managers
                   are always liable to some biases and inertia (see Chapter 5), this chapter introduces a number
                   of analytical tools and concepts that can help keep organisations alert to macro-environmental
                   change. The point is to minimize threats and to seize opportunities. The chapter is organised
                   in three main sections:

                   • PESTEL factors examine macro-environmental factors according to six key types: political,
                     economic, social, technological, ecological and legal. These factors include both market
                     and nonmarket aspects.
                   • Forecasting, which aims to predict, with varying degrees of precision or certainty.
                     Macro-environmental forecasting draws on PESTEL analysis and often makes use of three
                     conceptual tools: megatrends, inflexion points and weak signals.
                   • Scenario analysis – a technique that develops plausible alternative views of how the
                     environment might develop in the future. Scenario analysis differs from forecasting
                     because it avoids predictions about the future; it is more about learning different possi-
                     bilities for environmental change.

                   The structure of this chapter is summarised in Figure 2.2.



2.2 PESTEL analysis
                   This section introduces a key tool for analysing the broad macro-environment of an organ-
                   isation: PESTEL analysis. Providing a wide overview, PESTEL is likely to feed into both envi-
                   ronmental forecasts and scenario analyses.
                      The PESTEL framework is one of several frameworks (including the similar ‘PEST’ and
                   ‘STEEPLE’ frameworks) which categorise environmental factors into key types.1 PESTEL
                   analysis highlights six environmental factors in particular: political, economic, social,
                   technological, ecological and legal. This list underlines that the environment includes not
                   only the economics of markets, but also nonmarket factors. Organisations need to consider
                   both market and nonmarket aspects of strategy:2

                   • The market environment consists mainly of suppliers, customers and competitors. These
                     are environmental participants with whom interactions are primarily economic. Here

  companies typically compete for resources, revenues and profits. Pricing and innova-
  tion are often key strategies here. The market environment is discussed extensively
  in Chapter 3, but issues such as economic cycle are also considered in this chapter
  (Section 2.2.2).
• the nonmarket environment relates primarily to social, political, legal, and ecological
  factors, but can also be impacted by economic factors. The nonmarket environment
  typically involves interactions with non-governmental organisations (NGOs), polit-
  icians, government departments, regulators, political activists, campaign groups
  and the media. In the nonmarket environment, organisations need to build reputation,
  connections, influence and legitimacy. Lobbying, public relations, networking and collab-
  oration are key nonmarket strategies.

Nonmarket factors are obviously important for government and similar organisations
reliant on grants or subsidies, for example schools, hospitals and charities. However,
nonmarket factors can be very important for business organisations too. For example,
nonmarket factors are particularly important where the government or regulators are
powerful (for instance in the defence and healthcare sectors); where consumer sensitivities
are high (for instance in the food business); or in societies where political, business and
media elites are closely interconnected (typically smaller countries, or countries where the
state is powerful).
   The following sections consider each of the PESTEL elements in turn, providing key analyt-
ical concepts and frameworks for each. Meanwhile, Illustration 2.1 on the so-called FANGs
provides examples of various PESTEL factors, showing how in practice they often interrelate.


2.2.1 Politics
The political element of PESTEL highlights the role of the state and other political factors in
the macro-environment. There are two important steps in political analysis: first, identifying
the importance of political factors; second, carrying out political risk analysis.
   Figure 2.3 is a matrix that distinguishes two variables helpful to identifying the importance
of political factors:

• The role of the state: in many countries and sectors the state is often important as
  a direct economic actor, for instance as a customer, supplier, owner or regulator of
  businesses.
• Exposure to civil society organisations: civil society comprises a whole range of organisa-
  tions that are liable to raise political issues, including political lobbyists, campaign groups,
  social media or traditional media.

To take an example from Figure 2.3, the defence industry faces a highly politicised
environment. Defence companies typically have high direct state involvement: national
armed services are of course key customers, while states are often owners of their national
defence companies. At the same time, defence companies are often highly exposed to
groups from civil society, for instance campaigners against the international arms trade.
By contrast, food companies face less direct state involvement: most food companies are
privately owned and operate in private-sector markets. However, the political environ-
ment is still important for food companies, as they are typically exposed to pressures from
civil society in the form of fair trade campaigners, labour rights organisations and health
lobbying groups. Pressures from civil society organisations can increase state involvement
by demanding additional regulation, for instance buyer health standards for food products.
Canals are often state-owned but nowadays are not highly exposed to political pressures
from civil society organisations. Industries can rapidly change positions: thus revelations

   Organisations that face politicised environments need to carry out political risk analysis,
the analysis of threats and opportunities arising from potential political change. There are
two key dimensions to political risk analysis:3

• the macro–micro dimension. The macro dimension of political risk refers to the risks
  associated with whole countries: for instance Nigeria, Russia or Venezuela. Many
  specialist organisations publish relative rankings of countries’ macro political risks.
  Western European countries are typically ranked low in terms of macro political risk,
  as even changes of government following elections do not bring fundamental change.
  On the other hand, some Middle Eastern countries rank high in terms of macro polit-
  ical risk, because changes of government there can be sudden and radical.4 However,
  there is also an important micro dimension of political risk, relating to the specific risk
  of particular organisations or sectors within a country. It is important to distinguish
  between macro political risk and specific micro-level risk. China is typically ranked
  medium political risk on the macro dimension, but for some Japanese companies oper-
  ating there the micro dimension is higher and variable. For many Chinese consumers,
  resentment of Japan is strong and Japanese car companies are from time to time
  targeted by nationalist boycotts.
• the internal–external dimension. The internal dimension of political risk relates to factors
  originating within the countries, for example government change or pressure from local
  campaigning groups. These can be relatively easy to monitor, requiring attention to elec-
  tion dates and opinion polls for example. However, there are also external political risks,
  the knock-on effects of events occurring outside particular countries’ national boundaries.
  For example, a fall in oil prices driven by the internal politics of Saudi Arabia is liable to
  have negative economic and political impacts on other big oil-producing countries such
  as Russia and Venezuela. On the other hand, oil price falls can produce political benefits in
  energy importing countries such as India or Japan. External political risk analysis involves
  careful analysis of economic, political and other linkages between countries around
  the world.

                   2.2.2 Economics
                   The macro-environment is also influenced by macro-economic factors such as currency exchange
                   rates, interest rates and fluctuating economic growth rates around the world. It is important for
                   an organisation to understand how its markets are affected by the prosperity of the economy
                   as a whole. Managers should have a view on how changing exchange rates may affect viability
                   in export markets and vulnerability to imports. They should have an eye to changing interest
                   rates over time, especially if they have to borrow to fund strategic investments. They should
                   understand how economic growth rates rise or fall over time. There are many public sources
                   of economic forecasts that can help in predicting the movement of key economic indicators,
                   though these are often prone to error because of unexpected economic shocks.5
                       A key concept for analysing macro-economic trends is the economic cycle. Despite the poss-
                   ibility of unexpected shocks, economic growth rates have an underlying tendency to rise and
                   fall in cycles: several years of good growth are likely to be followed by a couple of years or so
                   of lower or even negative growth. These cycles link to other important economic variables. For
                   example, rises in interest rates are likely to decrease economic growth rates as consumers cut
                   back on credit cards and businesses borrow less for investment. Awareness of cycles reinforces
                   an important pattern in the macro-environment: good economic times do not last forever, while
                   bad economic times lead eventually to recovery. The key is to identify cyclical turning points.
                       Managers making long-term strategic decisions should assess where they stand in the
                   overall economic cycle. For example, after several years of rapid growth a company might
                   be tempted to launch major investments in new capacity: in Figure 2.4, this would be year
                   202x. However, any new facilities might not be needed in the subsequent slowdown, leaving
                   the company with expensive over-capacity which still needs to be paid for at a time of low
                   growth. On the other hand, two or three years of slowing growth might make a company
                   over-cautious about new investment. But after the cyclical turning point of year 202y in Figure 2.4,
                   the company might face under-capacity and be unable to match recovering demand. Rivals who
                   had invested in extra capacity (or new products) would be able to seize the advantage, leaving
                   the over-cautious company struggling to catch up. In assessing the economic environment,
                   therefore, it is crucial not to assume that current economic growth rates will continue. Before
                   making any strategic investment, you should ask where you are in the current economic cycle.
                       Some industries are particularly vulnerable to economic cycles, for example:

                   • Discretionary spend industries: where purchasers can easily put off their spending for a
                     year or so, there tend to be strong cyclical effects. Thus demand for furniture, restaurants
                     and cars tends be highly cyclical because people can easily delay or curtail spending on

  these for a while. After a period of reduced spending, there is liable to be a strong upturn
  as pent-up demand is finally released into the market.
• High fixed cost industries: industries such as airlines, hotels and steel suffer from economic
  downturns because high fixed costs in plant, equipment or labour tend to encourage
  competitive price-cutting to ensure maximum capacity utilisation when demand is low.
  For example, an airline might try to fill its seats in the face of falling demand simply by
  offering cheap tickets. If its competitors do the same, the resulting price-war will result in
  low profits for all the airlines.



2.2.3 Social
The social elements of the macro-environment have at least two impacts upon organisa-
tions. First, they can influence the specific nature of demand and supply, within the overall
economic growth rate. Second, they can shape the innovativeness, power and effectiveness
of organisations.
   In the first place, there are a number of key aspects of the social environment that can
shape demand and supply. These can be analysed under the following four headings:

• Demographics. For example, the ageing populations in many Western societies create
  opportunities and threats for both private and public sectors. There is increasing demand
  for services for the elderly, but diminishing supplies of young labour to look after them.
• Distribution. Changes in wealth distribution influence the relative sizes of markets. Thus
  the concentration of wealth in the hands of elites over the last 20 years has constrained
  some categories of ‘middle-class’ consumption, while enlarging markets for certain luxury
  goods.
• Geography. Industries and markets can be concentrated in particular locations. In the
  United Kingdom, economic growth has in recent decades been much faster in the London
  area than in the rest of the country. Similarly, industries often form ‘clusters’ in particular
  locations: thus there are high concentrations of scientists and engineers in California’s
  Silicon Valley (see also Chapter 10).6
• Culture. Changing cultural attitudes can also raise strategic challenges. For example, new
  ethical attitudes are challenging profit-maximising investment strategies in the financial
  services industry. Changing cultural attitudes can be linked to changing demographics.
  Thus the rise of ‘digital natives’ (generations born after the 1980s, and thus from child-
  hood immersed in digital technologies) is changing expectations about media, consump-
  tion and education.

   A second important social aspect of the macro-environment is organisational networks,
with significant implications for innovativeness, power and effectiveness. These networks are
frequently described as ‘organisational fields’.7 An organisational field is a community of
organisations that interact more frequently with one another than with those outside
the field. These organisational fields are partly economic as they include competing organ-
isations within the industry or sector, as well as customers and suppliers in the marketplace
(see Chapter 3). However, the concept of organisational fields also emphasises social inter-
actions with other organisations. Such social interactions may be with other businesses, for
instance via managers who are members of the same industry associations or sporting clubs,
or via non-executive directors who sit on several company boards. There may also be noneco-
nomic interactions with political organisations such as governments and campaign groups,
legal entities such as regulators, and other social groups, such as professions and trade
unions. Sometimes key actors in the field might even be particularly influential individuals,


                                                                                              41
Chapter 2 Macro-environment analysis


                   for example politicians. The organisational field is therefore much broader than just indus-
                   tries or markets. Because of the importance of social networks, managers need to analyse the
                   influence of a wide range of organisational field members, not just competitors, customers
                   and suppliers.
                       Networks and organisational fields can be analysed by means of sociograms, maps of
                   potentially important social (or economic) connections.8 For a new hi-technology enterprise,
                   important network connections might be links to leading universities, other innovative firms
                   or respected venture capitalists, for example. Sociograms can help assess the effectiveness of
                   networks and identify who is likely to be most powerful and innovative within them. Three
                   concepts help to understand effectiveness, innovativeness and power:

                   • Network density typically increases network effectiveness. Density refers to the number
                     of interconnections between members in the network map. Effectiveness is increased by
                     density because the more interconnections there are, the better the sharing of new ideas
                     between network members. Everybody is talking to each other, and nobody with poten-
                     tially useful information is isolated. It is easier to mobilise the whole network in support
                     of new initiatives. In Figure 2.5, the network on the right (organisation C’s network) is
                     denser than the network on the left (A’s network).
                   • Broker positions, which connect otherwise separate groups of organisations, are
                     often associated with innovativeness. Brokers’ innovation advantage stems from their
                     ability to link valuable information from one group of organisations with valuable infor-
                     mation from the other group. Because they provide the connection between the two
                     groups, they are able to exploit this combination of information before anybody else.
                     In Figure 2.5, organisation B is a broker, connecting the two networks on the right- and
                     left-hand sides.
                   • Central hub positions typically provide power within networks. A central hub connects
                     many organisations. Hubs have power because network members rely on them for inter-
                     connection with other members. Hubs are also potentially innovative because they can
                     collect ideas from the whole network, and they hear about what is going on in one part
                     of the network before most other parts. In Figure 2.5, both A and C are hubs. However,
                     organisation A is more central in its immediate network than organisation C (all network
                     members must pass through A), and to this extent is more powerful relative to its network
                     members.

                                C’s immediate network is denser than A’s; B is a broker; A is a more central
                                hub than C.

    Sociograms can have clear implications for strategic action. For example, organisation A
could gain an advantage over organisation B by establishing direct interaction with organ-
isation C, undermining B’s exclusive broker position. On the other hand, organisation E could
increase its innovativeness and improve its power relative to organisation A by making a
direct connection to organisation D in the right-hand network.
    Sociograms can be drawn for key people as well as organisations: individuals are often the
link between organisations anyway. Personal networks are important in many societies, for
example the network of former consultants at the elite McKinsey & Co. consulting firm, or
networks of company directors, or the interpersonal guanxi networks that prevail in China.
Illustration 2.2 describes the network that has emerged from the armed service backgrounds
of many Israeli entrepreneurs. The crucial issue in analysing social networks is how hub posi-
tions, brokering roles and network density are likely to affect a particular organisation’s
power, innovativeness and overall effectiveness.
    Some organisational fields can be characterised as ‘small worlds’.9 Small worlds exist
where the large majority of a network’s members is closely connected, either just one step
away (as C is from A in Figure 2.5) or perhaps a couple of steps away (as E is from B). Small
worlds typically give members a good deal of protection and effectiveness, due to their
density. However, outsider organisations (for example foreign firms) will have difficulty
penetrating small world networks on their own, and will typically require the help of insiders.
Small worlds are particularly likely in societies where economic activity is geographically
concentrated or where social elites share common backgrounds (for example, the French
elite is often characterised as living in the same exclusive parts of Paris and as graduating
from a small group of higher education institutions, especially the Grandes Ecoles). Thus an
important aspect of social analysis is the extent of small worlds in the macro-environment.


2.2.4 Technology
Further important elements within the macro-environment are technologies such as the
Internet, nanotechnology or new composite materials, whose impacts can spread far
beyond single industries. As in the case of internet streaming, new technologies can open
up opportunities for some organisations (e.g. Spotify and YouTube), while challenging others
(traditional music and broadcasting companies). Chapter 10 will discuss specific strategies
surrounding innovative new technologies in more detail.
   Meanwhile, it is important to carry out the macro-environmental analysis of technology
in order to identify areas of potential innovative activity. There are five primary indicators
of innovative activity:10

• Research and development budgets: innovative firms, sectors or countries can be identi-
  fied by the extent of spending on research, typically reported in company annual reports
  and government statistics.
• Patenting activity: firms active in patenting new technologies can be identified on national
  patent registers, the most important being the United States Patents and Trademarks
  Office.
• Citation analysis: the potential impact of patents and scientific papers on technology can
  be measured by the extent to which they are widely cited by other organisations, with
  data available from Google Scholar for instance.
• New product announcements: organisations typically publicise their new product plans
  through press releases and similar media.
• Media coverage: specialist technology and industry media will cover stories of the latest
  or impending technologies, as will various social media.


                                                                                            43

Although there is some variation between firms, sectors and countries in how far their inno-
vative activity is reflected by these kinds of indicators, generally they will help to identify areas
of rapid technological change and locate centres of technological leadership. For example,
the number of patent applications for the new material graphene (a material just one atom
thick, but both strong and highly flexible) increased from less than 100 a year in 2006 to 4,000
a year a decade later. China alone accounts for 58 per cent of the world’s graphene patent
applications and, while 76 applicants that have at least 60 applications each in the sector, 49
of them are Chinese organisations.11 For any organisation seeking a strong position in the
fast-developing graphene industry, links with China will plainly be important.
   Many organisations also publish technology roadmaps for their sectors going forward.12
Technology roadmaps project into the future various product or service demands, identify
technology alternatives to meet these demands, select the most promising alternatives and
then offer a timeline for their development. Thus they provide good indicators of future tech-
nological developments. Figure 2.6 provides a simplified technology roadmap for the Internet
of Things, providing connectivity for devices from fridges to heart monitors: in the period to
2033, this roadmap forecasts rapid progress in the number of Central Processing Units (CPUs)
and sensors per device, but less progress in CPU frequency, a measure of processing speed.
This kind of roadmap has implications for product design strategies in industries far beyond
the electronics industry, for instance architecture, domestic appliances and healthcare.


2.2.5 Ecological
Within the PESTEL framework, ecological stands specifically for ‘green’ macro-environmental
issues, such as pollution, waste and climate change. Environmental regulations can impose
additional costs, for example pollution controls, but they can also be a source of opportunity,
for example the new businesses that emerged around mobile phone recycling.

Chapter 2 Macro-environment analysis


                     When considering ecological issues in the macro-environment, there are three sorts of
                   challenges that organisations may need to meet:13

                   • Direct pollution obligations are an obvious challenge, and nowadays typically involve not
                     just cleaning up ‘at the end of the pipe’ (for example, disposing of waste by-products
                     safely), but also minimising the production of pollutants in the first place. Having clean
                     processes for supply, production and distribution is generally better than managing the
                     consequences of polluting after the fact.
                   • Product stewardship refers to managing ecological issues through both the organisation’s
                     entire value chain and the whole life cycle of the firm’s products. Stewardship here might
                     involve responsibility for the ecological impact of external suppliers or final end-users.
                     It will also involve responsibility for what happens to products at ‘end of life’, in other
                     words how they are disposed of when consumers have no more use for them. Thus car
                     manufacturers are increasingly responsible for the recycling and safe disposal of old cars.
                   • Sustainable development is a criterion of increasing importance and refers not simply
                     to reducing environmental damage, but to whether the product or service can be
                     produced indefinitely into the future. This sustainability criterion sets constraints on the
                     over-exploitation of particular sources of raw materials, for instance in developing countries,
                     and often raises issues regarding the economic and social well-being of local communities.

                   In assessing the macro-environment from an ecological point of view, all three criteria of
                   pollution, stewardship and sustainability need typically to be considered.
                      The extent to which these ecological criteria are important to organisations relies on three
                   contextual sources of pressure, the first two arising directly from the macro-environment:

                   • Ecological. Clearly ecological issues are more likely to be pressing the more impactful
                     they are: a chemical company may have more to worry about than a school. However,
                     there are three less obvious characteristics to assess. First, ecological issues become more
                     salient the more certain they are. For example, as doubts have reduced about the facts of
                     global warming, so the pressures on organisations to act on it have increased. Pressures
                     are also likely to be greater the more visible ecological issues are: aircraft pollution is more
                     salient as an issue than shipping pollution because aircraft are more obvious to ordinary
                     citizens than pollution done far out to sea. Similarly, the emotivity of the issue is liable to
                     be a factor: threats to polar bears generally get more attention than threats to hyenas.
                     Ecological analysis therefore requires assessing certainty, visibility and emotivity.
                   • Organisational field. Ecological issues do not become salient just because of their inherent
                     characteristics. The extent of pressure is influenced by how ecological issues interact with
                     the nature of the organisational field. An organisational field with highly active regulators
                     or campaign groups will clearly give saliency to ecological issues. However, high levels
                     of field interconnectedness will also increase the importance of ecological issues: within
                     densely interconnected networks, it is harder to hide damaging behaviour and peer pres-
                     sure to conform to ecological standards is greater.
                   • Internal organisation. The personal values of an organisation’s leadership will clearly influ-
                     ence the desire to respond to ecological issues. Actual responsiveness will rely on the
                     effectiveness of managerial systems that promote and monitor behaviours consistent with
                     ecological obligations.

                       Although ecological issues can exercise unwelcome pressure, there are potentially strong
                   organisational motives to respond. As in Figure 2.7, the three kinds of contextual pressure can
                   satisfy a variety of motives. Fundamentally, there is of course a sense of ecological responsi-
                   bility: thus the personal values of the organisation’s leaders might stimulate ecological initia-
                   tives, or routine production systems might reduce pollution. However, another outcome can

be legitimacy, as reflected in regulatory compliance and a good reputation with consumers.
Finally, responding to ecological issues can even enhance competitiveness. For example, mini-
mising waste in production processes for pollution reasons can reduce costs. Green products
are attractive in the marketplace and often command a price premium.


2.2.6 Legal
The final element in a PESTEL analysis of the macro-environment refers to legal aspects.
These can cover a wide range of topics: for example, labour, environmental and consumer
regulation; taxation and reporting requirements; and rules on ownership, competition
and corporate governance. In recent years, the relaxation of legal constraints through
deregulation has created many new business opportunities, for example for low cost
airlines and ‘free schools’ in various countries. However, regulations can also handicap
organisations: Illustration 2.3 shows how the e-cigarette company Juul ran into important
legal issues as it entered new markets and regulators struggled to keep up with the new
technology.
   Legal issues form an important part of the institutional environment of organisations,
by which is meant the formal and informal ‘rules of the game’. 14 This concept of insti-
tutional environment suggests that it can be useful in a PESTEL analysis to consider not
only formal laws and regulations but also more informal norms: the ‘L’ can be stretched
to cover all types of rule, formal and informal. Informal rules are patterns of expected
(ŉormal’) behaviour that are hard to ignore. Thus, regardless of the law, there are fairly
explicit norms regarding proper respect for the ecological environment. Organisations
ignoring these norms would risk outrage among consumers or employees, whatever the
legal situation.
   Formal and informal rules vary sufficiently between countries to define very different
institutional environments, sometimes known as ‘varieties of capitalism’.15 These vari-
eties of capitalism have implications for the ways in which business and management
are done in those environments and the prospects for success, both for insiders and for
outsiders. Although every country differs in detail, three broad varieties of capitalism

have been identified, whose formal and informal rules lead to different ways of
doing business:

• Liberal market economies are institutional environments where both formal and informal
  rules favour competition between companies, aggressive acquisitions of one company
  by another and free bargaining between management and labour. Companies in these
  liberal market economies tend to raise funds from the financial markets and company
  ownership is either entrepreneurial or, for older companies, widely dispersed among
  many shareholders. These economies tend to support radical innovation and are recep-
  tive to foreign firms. Although neither is perfectly representative, the United States and
  the United Kingdom correspond broadly to this type of institutional environment.
• Coordinated market economies encourage more coordination between companies, often
  supported by industry associations or similar frameworks. There are legal and normative
  constraints on hostile acquisitions on the one hand, and various supports for consensual
  and collective arrangements between management and labour on the other. Companies
  in these coordinated market economies tend to rely on banks for funding, while family
  ownership is often common. These economies support steady innovation over the
  long-run and, because of coordination networks, are typically less easy for foreign firms to
  penetrate. Again, neither is perfectly representative, but Germany and Japan correspond
  broadly to this type of institutional environment.
• Developmental market economies tend to have strong roles for the state, which will either
  own or heavily influence companies that are important for national economic devel-
  opment. Formally or informally, the state will often encourage private-sector firms to
  coordinate between themselves and with national economic policy-makers. Labour rela-
  tions may be highly regulated. Banks, often state-owned, will be a key source of funding.
  Long-term, infrastructural and capital-intensive projects may be favoured, but foreign
  firms will often be at a disadvantage. Although each is very different in its own way, Brazil,
  China and India all have aspects of this developmental market economy environment.

A macro-environmental analysis of any particular country should therefore include an assess-
ment of the local variety of capitalism and the extent to which it favours particular kinds of
firm and strategy.


2.2.7 Key drivers for change
The previous sections have introduced a variety of concepts and frameworks for analysing
each of the PESTEL factors, particularly at a macro-level. As can be imagined, analysing these
factors, together with their interrelationships, can produce long and complex lists of issues.
Rather than getting overwhelmed by a multitude of details, it is necessary to step back to
identify the key drivers for change in a particular context.16 Key drivers for change are the
environmental factors likely to have a high impact on industries and sectors, and the
success or failure of strategies within them.
   Key drivers thus translate macro-environmental factors to the level of the specific industry
or sector. Thus social and legislative changes discouraging car use might have different and
greater effects on supermarkets than, for example, retail banks. Identifying key drivers for
change in an industry or sector helps managers to focus on the PESTEL factors that are most
important and which must be addressed most urgently. Without a clear sense of the key
drivers for change, managers will not be able to take the strategic decisions that allow for
effective responses: to return to the example above, the supermarket chain might address
reduced car use by cutting the number of out-of-town stores and investing in smaller urban
and suburban sites. It is important that an organisation’s strategists consider each of the
key drivers for change, looking to minimise threats and, where possible, seize opportunities.

                                                                                             49
Chapter 2 Macro-environment analysis



2.3 Forecasting
                   In a sense, all strategic decisions involve forecasts about future conditions and outcomes. Thus
                   a manager may decide to invest in new capacity because of a forecast of growing demand
                   (condition), with the expectation that the investment will help capture increased sales
                   (outcome). PESTEL factors will feed into these forecasts, for example in tracking economic
                   cycles or mapping future technologies. However, accurate forecasting is notoriously diffi-
                   cult. After all, in strategy, organisations are frequently trying to surprise their competitors.
                   Consequently, forecasting takes three fundamental approaches to the future based on
                   varying degrees of certainty: single-point, range and multiple-futures forecasting. This
                   section explains these three approaches and also introduces some key concepts that help
                   explore the direction of future change.


                   2.3.1 Forecast approaches
                   The three approaches to forecasting are explored in the following and illustrated in
                   Figure 2.8:17

                   • Single-point forecasting is where organisations have such confidence about the future
                     that they will provide just one forecast number (as in Figure 2.8 i). For instance, an
                     organisation might predict that the population in a market will grow by 5 per cent in the
                     next two years. This kind of single-point forecasting implies a great degree of certainty.
                     Demographic trends (for instance the increase in the elderly within a particular popula-
                     tion) lend themselves to these kinds of forecasting, at least in the short term. They are
                     also often attractive to organisations because they are easy to translate into budgets:
                     a single sales forecast figure is useful for motivating managers and for holding them
                     accountable.
                   • Range forecasting is where organisations have less certainty, suggesting a range of
                     possible outcomes. These different outcomes may be expressed with different degrees
                     of probability, with a central projection identified as the most probable (the darkest
                     shaded area in Figure 2.8 ii), and then a range of more remote outcomes given decreasing
                     degrees of likelihood (the more lightly shaded areas). These forecasts are often called
                     ‘fan charts’, because the range of outcomes ‘fans out’ more widely over time, reflecting
                     growing uncertainty over the longer term. These ‘fan charts’ are often used in economic
                     forecasting, for example economic growth rates or inflation.

• Alternative futures forecasting typically involves even less certainty, focusing on a set of
  possible yet distinct futures. Instead of a continuously graduated range of likelihoods,
  alternative futures are discontinuous: they happen or they do not, with radically different
  outcomes (see Figure 2.8 iii). These alternatives might result from fundamental policy deci-
  sions. For example, for a country facing possible exit from a currency union (for instance
  the Euro), outcome A might reflect the consequences for growth or unemployment of
  staying in the union; outcome B might reflect the consequences of exiting the union;
  and outcome C would be a further alternative outcome, consequent on a decision that
  followed the initial decision pointing towards outcome B (for instance, to adopt trade
  barriers as well as to exit the currency union). For a business, outcome A might represent
  expected sales if a competitor business did not invest in a new machine or similar capacity;
  outcome B is a consequence of the competitor making that investment; and outcome
  C is a consequence of the competitor both making that investment and then slashing
  prices to make full use of the new capacity. It is possible to put probabilities to each of
  these outcomes too: for example, outcome A might have a 40 per cent probability, while
  outcomes B and C would be 30 per cent each. These kinds of alternative futures are often
  fed into scenario analyses (see Section 2.4), though not as simple forecasts.



2.3.2 Directions of change
It is helpful in forecasting to keep an eye on the fundamental directions of likely change.
Managers need to check their forecasts are consistent with major trends and to be alert to
possible turning points. Three concepts help focus both on major trends and on possible
turning points that might invalidate existing forecasts:

• Megatrends are large-scale political, economic, social, technological, ecological or legal
  movements that are typically slow to form, but which influence many areas of activity,
  possibly over decades.18 A megatrend typically sets the direction for other factors. Thus
  the social megatrend towards ageing populations in the West influences other trends in
  social care, retail spending and housing. The megatrend towards global warming affects
  agriculture, tourism and, with more extreme climatic events, insurance. It is important to
  identify major megatrends because they influence so many other things. Forecasts should
  be checked for consistency with such trends.
• Inflexion points are moments when trends shift in direction, for instance turning sharply
  upwards or downwards.19 For example, after decades of stagnation and worse, in the
  early twenty-first century sub-Saharan Africa may have reached an inflexion point in
  its economic growth, with the promise of substantial gains in the coming decade or so.
  Internet retailing may also have put urban shopping on a path to significant decline in
  advanced economies. Inflexion points are likely to invalidate forecasts that extrapolate
  existing trends. Clearly it is valuable to grasp the inflexion point at the moment when
  trends just start to turn, in order either to take advantage of new opportunities early or
  to act against escalating decline as soon as possible.
• Weak signals are advanced signs of future trends and are particularly helpful in identi-
  fying inflexion points.20 Typically these weak signals are unstructured and fragmented
  bits of information, often perceived by observers as ‘weird’. A weak signal for the world-
  wide financial crisis that began in 2008 was the rise in mortgage failures in California the
  previous year. An early weak signal foreshadowing the current success of Asian business
  schools was the first entry of the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology into the

                      important to be alert to weak signals, but it is also easy to be overwhelmed by ŉoise’, the
                      constant stream of isolated and random bits of information without strategic importance.
                      Some signs of truly significant weak signals (as opposed to mere noise) include: the repe-
                      tition of the signal and the emergence of some kind of pattern; vehement disagreement
                      among experts about the signal’s significance; and an unexpected failure in something
                      that had previously worked very reliably.




2.4 Scenario analysis
                   Scenarios offer plausible alternative views of how the macro-environment might develop
                   in the future, typically in the long term. Thus scenarios are not strategies in themselves,
                   but alternative possible environments which strategies have to deal with. Scenario analysis is
                   typically used in conditions of high uncertainty, for example where the environment could go
                   in several highly distinct directions.21 However, scenario analyses can be differentiated from
                   alternative futures forecasting (Section 2.3.1), as scenario planners usually avoid presenting
                   alternatives in terms of finely calculated probabilities. Scenarios tend to extend too far into
                   the future to allow probability calculations and besides, assigning probabilities directs atten-
                   tion to the most likely scenario rather than to the whole range. The point of scenarios is
                   more to learn than to predict. Scenarios are used to explore the way in which environmental
                   factors inter-relate and to help keep managers’ minds open to alternatives possibilities in
                   the future. A scenario with a very low likelihood may be valuable in deepening managers’
                   understanding even if it never occurs.
                      Illustration 2.4 shows an example of scenario planning for the world of work to 2030,
                   published by the international advisory firm PwC. The scenarios start from five megatrends
                   covering a range of factors from technology to natural resources. PwC then identifies two
                   drivers which are clearly differentiated on the dimensions of the scenario cube in terms of
                   having (i) high potential impact; (ii) high uncertainty; (iii) high independence from each other
                   (see Figure 2.9 and below). The first of these two drivers is political, i.e. collectivism versus indi-
                   vidualism, referring to the roles of government. The second of these key drivers addresses the
                   nature of business, i.e. integration versus fragmentation, pointing to the relative importance

                   of big and small firms. Both of these drivers may produce very different futures, which can be
                   combined to create four internally consistent scenarios for the next decade or so. The various
                   scenarios draw in distinct ways on the megatrends: for example, Green World assumes a
                   different response to resource scarcity than Blue World; Red World is less optimistic than
                   Green World about the capacity of government regulators to keep up with technological
                   change. PwC does not predict that one scenario will prevail over the others, nor do they
                   allocate relative probabilities. Prediction would close managers’ minds to alternatives, while
                   probabilities would imply a spurious kind of accuracy over this period of time.
                      While there are many ways to carry out scenario analyses, the process often follows five
                   basic steps (summarised in Figure 2.10):22

                   • Defining scenario scope is an important first step in the process. Scope refers to the subject
                     of the scenario analysis and the time span. For example, scenario analyses can be carried
                     out for a whole industry globally, or for particular geographical regions and markets.
                     While businesses typically produce scenarios for industries or markets, governments often
                     conduct scenario analyses for countries, regions or sectors (such as the future of healthcare
                     or higher education). Scenario time spans can be either a decade or so (as in Illustration
                     2.4) or perhaps just five years ahead. The appropriate time span is determined partly by
                     the expected life of investments. In the energy business, where oil fields might have a life
                     span of several decades, scenarios often cover 20 years or more.
                   • Identifying the key drivers for change comes next. Here PESTEL analysis can be used to
                     uncover issues likely to have a major impact upon the future of the industry, region or
                     market. In the information technology, key drivers range from regulation to innovation.
                     The scenario cube (Figure 2.9) helps identify the most significant key drivers. As well as
                     the size of impact, the scenario cube underlines two additional criteria for key drivers:
                     uncertainty, in order to make different scenarios worthwhile (there’s no point in devel-
                     oping alternative scenarios when only one outcome is likely); and mutual independence,
                     so that the drivers are capable of producing significantly divergent or opposing outcomes
                     (there’s no point in considering factors individually if they lead to the same outcome
                     anyway). In the oil industry, for example, political stability in the oil-producing regions
                     is one major uncertainty; another is the development of new exploration technologies,
                     enabling the quick and efficient identification of new oil fields. These could be selected
                     as key drivers for scenario analysis because both are uncertain and regional stability is not
                     closely correlated with technological advance.
                   • Developing scenario ‘stories’. As in films, scenarios are basically stories. Having selected
                     opposing key drivers for change, it is necessary to knit together plausible stories that incor-
                     porate both key drivers and other factors into a coherent whole. These stories are often
                     encapsulated with striking titles: for example, oil company Shell launched two opposing
                     scenarios entitled simply ‘Oceans’ and ‘Mountains’, the first describing a more free-market

                     • Identifying impacts of alternative scenarios on organisations is the next key stage of
                       scenario building. For example, in Illustration 2.4, a Blue World would pose major
                       challenges for small and ethical businesses. It is important for an organisation to carry
                       out robustness checks in the face of each plausible scenario and to adapt strategies that
                       appear vulnerable and develop contingency plans in case they happen.
                     • Monitor progress. Once the various scenarios are drawn up, organisations should
                       monitor progress over time, to alert themselves to whether and how developments
                       actually fit scenario expectations. Here it is important to identify indicators that might
                       give early warning about the final direction of environmental change, and at the same
                       time set up systems to monitor these. Effective monitoring of well-chosen indicators
                       should facilitate prompt and appropriate responses. In Illustration 2.4, the diminishing
                       likelihood of a Red World would be growing regulation of technology firms such as Uber
                       and airbnb.

                         Because debating and learning are so valuable in the scenario-building process, and they
                     deal with such high uncertainty, some scenario experts advise managers to avoid producing
                     just three scenarios. Three scenarios tend to fall into a range of ‘optimistic’, ‘middling’ and
                     ‘pessimistic’. Managers naturally focus on the middling scenario and neglect the other two,
                     reducing the amount of organisational learning and contingency planning. It is therefore
                     typically better to have two or four scenarios, avoiding an easy mid-point. It does not matter
                     if the scenarios do not come to pass: the value lies in the process of exploration and contin-
                     gency planning that the scenarios set off.

Chapter 2 Macro-environment analysis




                       Summary
                       • Environmental influences can be thought of as layers around an organisation, with the
                         outer layer making up the macro-environment, the middle layer making up the industry
                         or sector and the inner layer strategic groups and market segments.
                       • The macro-environment can be analysed in terms of the PESTEL factors – political, economic,
                         social, technological, ecological and legal.
                       • Macro-environmental trends can be forecast according to different levels of uncertainty,
                         from single-point, through ranges to multiple-futures.
                       • A PESTEL analysis helps identify key drivers of change, which managers need to address in
                         their strategic choices. Alternative scenarios about the future can be constructed according
                         to how the key drivers develop.

                       2.1    For an organisation of your choice, carry out a PESTEL analysis and identify key
                              opportunities and threats. Use Illustration 2.1 as a model. For simplicity, choose an
                              organisation that is focused on a limited number of industries.
                       2.2    For your own country, or any other country with which you are familiar, look up the
                              political risk as assessed by Aon, the Economist Intelligence Unit or similar (see refer-
                              ences in endnote 4). How far do you agree with this assessment?
                       2.3    For the last year or two, review the forecasts for national or global economic growth
                              made by key forecasting organisations such as the OECD or the World Bank (see
                              references in endnote 5). How accurate were they? What accounts for any difference
                              between forecast and outcomes?
                       2.4✱ For the same organisation as in assignment 2.1, and using Illustration 2.4 or Siemens
                            A as a model, construct four scenarios for the evolution of its macro-environment
                            (or main industry or sector). What implications are there for the organisation’s strategy?

                       Integrative assignment
                       2.5    Carry out a full analysis of an industry or sector of your choice (using for example
                              PESTEL and scenarios). Draw also on the five forces and strategic groups analyses of
                              Chapter 3. Consider explicitly how the industry or sector is affected by globalisation
                              (see Chapter 9, particularly Figure 9.2 on drivers) and innovation (see Chapter 10,
                              particularly Figure 10.2 on product and process innovation).

3.1 Introduction
          In the last chapter we considered how the broad macro-environment influences opportu-
          nities and threats. The impact of these general factors tends to surface in the immediate
          environment of the specific industry or sector and this nearby environment is the focus of this
          chapter. For example, Samsung’s strategy depends on the smartphone industry: here it must
          take account of competitors’ strategies, customers’ needs, and the supply of phone compo-
          nents, for example microchips. Similarly, a hospital needs to consider actors in the healthcare
          sector including clients, other healthcare providers and the supply of healthcare inputs such as
          pharmaceuticals. This suggests that it is crucial for managers to carefully examine the industry
          or sector and the actors these involve carefully in order to determine what strategy to pursue.
             The focus here is thus on the middle ‘industry’ and ‘sector’ layer in Figure 2.1 (see page 35),
          which involves central actors that influence an organisation’s long-term survival and success
          including competitors, customers or clients, and suppliers. An industry is a group of firms
          producing products and services that are essentially the same.1 Examples are the auto-
          mobile industry and the airline industry. Industries are also often described as ‘sectors’,
          especially in public services (e.g. the health sector or the education sector). Industries
          and sectors are often made up of several specific markets or market segments. A market
          is a group of customers for specific products or services that are essentially the same
          (e.g. a particular geographical market). Thus, the automobile industry has markets in North
          America, Europe and Asia, for example.
             This chapter examines three main topics and provides different frameworks and concepts
          for understanding the industry or sector:

          • Industry analysis through the use of the Competitive Five Forces Framework, which exam-
            ines five essential industry forces: competitors, customers, potential entrants, suppliers
            and substitutes. One additional factor is complementors and the related phenomenon
            network effects. Together these forces and factors provide an understanding of industry
            attractiveness and competitive strategy.
          • Fundamental industry structures and dynamics, which include examinations of underlying
            economic industry types and how industries evolve through industry life cycles, which might
            influence changes in the five forces that can be examined with a comparative five force analysis.
          • Competitor groups and segments including examinations of strategic groups, groups of
            organisations with similar strategies and of market segments, groups of customers with
            similar needs. This focus provides a more fine-grained understanding of competition
            within an industry or sector.

          The structure and topics of this chapter are summarised in Figure 3.1.

3.2 Industry analysis
                    Industries vary widely in terms of their long-term attractiveness, as measured by how easy
                    it is for participating firms to earn high profits. A key determinant of profitability is the
                    extent of competition and the strength of buyers and suppliers and this varies between
                    industries. Where competition and buyer and supplier strengths are low, and there is little
                    threat of new competitors, participating firms should normally expect good profits. Prof-
                    itability between industries can thus vary considerably; for example, the pharmaceutical
                    industry has performed very well historically while others, like the airline industry, have
                    underperformed.2
                        Porter’s Five Forces Framework 3 assists industry analysis and helps to identify
                    industry attractiveness in terms of five competitive forces: (i) extent of rivalry
                    between competitors; (ii) threat of entry; (iii) threat of substitutes; (iv) power of
                    buyers; and (v) power of suppliers. These five forces together determine an industry’s
                    ‘structure’ and its attractiveness (see Figure 3.2). Once this has been understood, the
                    five forces can help set an agenda for action on various critical issues: for example, what

specific strategy to pursue in order to control excessive rivalry in a particular industry?
Managers should try to find positions where the organisation can best defend itself
against strong competitive forces or where they can influence them in its favour. The rest
of this section first discusses how to define the scope of an industry and then introduces
each of the five forces in more detail and discusses the implications of these for strategy.
Illustration 3.3 (see page 74) summarises industry and sector analysis and provides an
overview of its various steps.


3.2.1 Defining the industry
One of the primary issues for managers is to identify the arena of competition. The first
step in an industry analysis is thus to define the industry. If defined incorrectly there is a
risk that significant strategy aspects are overlooked. There are three fundamental issues to
consider here. First, and most generally, the industry must not be defined too broadly or
narrowly. For example, if an entrepreneur considers starting a taxi business in Stockholm and
makes an industry analysis it would be much too broad to define the industry as ‘the Swedish
personal transportation industry’ while ‘the minicab industry in central Stockholm’ would be
too narrow. The first definition would include such a wide variety of actors that the analysis
risks becoming meaningless, while the second risks excluding important competitors (e.g.
taxi firms from the suburbs).
   Secondly, the broader industry value chain needs to be considered. Different industries
often operate in different parts of a value chain or value system and should be analysed
separately (see Section 4.4.2 for a discussion of value systems). For example, the iron ore
industry (including companies like Vale, Rio Tinto and BHP Billiton) delivers to the steel manu-
facturing industry (including companies like Mittal Steel and Tata Steel) that in turn deliver
to a wide variety of industries such as automobiles and construction. These three stages in
the broader value chain or system should be analysed separately.
   Thirdly, most industries can be analysed at different levels, for example different geogra-
phies, markets and even different product or service segments within them (see Section 3.4.2
below). Thus, the airline industry has different geographical markets (Europe, China and
so on) and it also has different service segments within each market (e.g. leisure, business
and freight). The competitive forces are likely to be different for each of these markets and
segments, with distinct buyers, suppliers and barriers, etc. Michael Porter has his own rule
of thumb here and suggests that you are likely dealing with distinct industries if there are
differences between them in more than one competitive force, or where differences in any
force are large. In brief, it is important to consider both to what extent a market is national,
regional or global (see Section 9.4 for a discussion of degree of internationalisation) and if
product and service segments differ.
   Larger corporations are often organised based on diverse markets and segments and
would thus analyse each separately. For example, Electrolux, the Swedish appliance manu-
facturer, organises its major appliances (refrigerators, washing machines, etc.) in regional
geographical markets, but also has two global business segments (small appliances and
professional products) and would analyse all these separately. The specific strategy ques-
tion or organisation at issue might also provide a good indication of how to define the
industry. Sometimes there is no ideal way of drawing the industry boarders. Under these
circumstances the important thing is to draw the industry borders clearly. They must be
drawn consistently when it comes to what actors are inside and outside the industry. In
particularly complex cases it might be necessary to try out both narrower definitions to
identify details and broader ones to avoid overlooking important actors. Finally, industry
borders may change over time depending on macro-environment changes and moves by
competitors (as discussed below in Section 3.3.2).

                                                                                             65
Chapter 3 Industry and sector analysis


                    3.2.2 The competitive forces
                    Porter’s main message is that where the competitive five forces are strong, industries are not
                    attractive to compete in. Excessive competitive rivalry, powerful buyers and suppliers and
                    the threat of substitutes or new entrants will all combine to squeeze profitability. Although
                    initially developed with businesses in mind, the Five Forces Framework is relevant to most
                    organisations. It can provide a useful starting point for strategic analysis even where profit
                    criteria may not apply. In the public sector, it is important to understand how powerful
                    suppliers can push up costs; in the charity sector it is important to avoid excessive rivalry
                    within the same sector and market. Not-for-profits may also want to consider how likely a
                    grant provider for an organisation or member of a charity organisation would substitute for
                    someone else providing similar services.
                       It’s important to keep in mind that the whole industry is in focus when making a five
                    forces analysis rather than an individual firm or group of firms. It often makes sense to start
                    the analysis with rivalry as it defines the various core players from the very beginning and
                    this is thus discussed first below.


                    Competitive rivalry
                    At the centre of five forces analysis is the rivalry between the existing players – ‘incumbents’ –
                    in an industry. The more competitive rivalry there is, the worse it is for incumbents. Compet-
                    itive rivals are organisations aiming at the same customer groups and with similar products
                    and services (i.e. not substitutes). In the European airline industry, Air France and British
                    Airways are rivals; high-speed trains are a ‘substitute’ (see below). Five factors tend to define
                    the extent of rivalry in an industry or market:

                    • Competitor concentration and balance. Where competitors are numerous or of roughly
                      equal size or power there is the danger of intensely rivalrous behaviour as competitors
                      attempt to gain dominance over others, through aggressive price cuts for example.
                      Conversely, less rivalrous industries tend to have one or two dominant organisations,
                      with the smaller players reluctant to challenge the larger ones directly (e.g. by focusing
                      on niches to avoid the ‘attention’ of the dominant companies).
                    • Industry growth rate. In situations of strong growth, an organisation can grow with the
                      market, but in situations of low growth or decline, any growth is likely to be at the expense
                      of a rival and meet with fierce resistance. Low-growth markets are therefore often associ-
                      ated with price competition and low profitability. The industry life cycle influences growth
                      rates, and hence competitive conditions (see Section 3.3.2).
                    • High fixed costs. Industries with high fixed costs, perhaps because they require high invest-
                      ments in capital equipment or initial research, tend to be highly rivalrous. Companies
                      will seek to spread their fixed costs (i.e. reduce unit costs) by increasing their volumes: to
                      do so, they typically cut their prices, prompting competitors to do the same and thereby
                      triggering price wars in which all competitors in the industry suffers. Similarly, if extra
                      capacity can only be added in large increments (as in many manufacturing sectors, for
                      example a chemical or glass factory), the competitor making such an addition is likely to
                      create short-term overcapacity in the industry, leading to increased competition to use
                      capacity.
                    • High exit barriers. The existence of high barriers to exit – in other words, high closure or
                      disinvestment costs – tends to increase rivalry, especially in declining industries. Excess
                      capacity persists and consequently incumbents fight to maintain market share. Exit barriers

  might be high for a variety of reasons: for example, high redundancy costs or high invest-
  ment in specific assets such as plant and equipment which others would not buy.
• Low differentiation. In a commodity market, where products or services are poorly differenti-
  ated, rivalry is increased because there is little to stop customers switching between compet-
  itors and the only way to compete is on price. Petrol is a commodity market, for instance.


The threat of entry
How easy it is to enter the industry influences the degree of competition. The greater the
threat of entry, the worse it is for incumbents in an industry. An attractive industry has high
barriers to entry that reduce the threat of new competitors. Barriers to entry are the factors
that need to be overcome by new entrants if they are to compete in an industry. Illustra-
tion 3.1 describes the entry barriers into the banking industry and the obstacles they provide
for new entrants. Five important entry barriers are:

• Scale and experience. In some industries, economies of scale are extremely important: for
  example, in pharmaceuticals where there are extremely high fixed costs for extensive R&D
  and marketing that must be spread over high levels of output (see Chapter 7 for further
  details on economies of scale). Once incumbents have reached large-scale production, it will
  be very expensive for new entrants to match them and until they reach a similar volume
  they will have higher unit costs. Barriers to entry also come from experience curve effects
  that give incumbents a cost advantage because they have learned how to do things more
  efficiently than an inexperienced new entrant could possibly do (see Section 7.3.1). Until the
  new entrant has built up equivalent experience over time, it will tend to produce at higher
  cost. In addition to these supply-side economies of scale there are ‘demand or buyer side’
  economies of scale, or so called network effects in some industries, as buyers value being in a
  ’network’ of a large number of other customers (see Section 3.2.3 below for further details).
• Access to supply or distribution channels. In many industries incumbents have had control
  over supply and/or distribution channels. Sometimes this has been through direct owner-
  ship (vertical integration), sometimes just through customer or supplier loyalty. In some
  industries this barrier has been overcome by new entrants who have bypassed retail
  distributors and sold directly to consumers through e-commerce (e.g. Dell Computers
  and Amazon). Similarly, incumbents may have cost or quality advantages not available to
  entrants, including access to proprietary technology (e.g. patents), geographical locations
  or brand identity (e.g. Coca Cola).
• Capital requirements. The level of financial resources needed to enter an industry can
  prevent entry. To enter the pharmaceutical industry, for example, huge research and
  development investments over many years are needed. While large corporations may
  have access to the capital needed it may limit the number of likely entrants.
• Legislation or government action. Legal restraints on new entry vary from patent protec-
  tion (e.g. pharmaceuticals), to regulation of markets (e.g. pension selling), through to
  direct government action (e.g. tariffs). Of course, organisations are vulnerable to new
  entrants if governments remove such protection, as has happened with deregulation of
  the airline industry over the last couple of decades.
• Expected retaliation. If an organisation considering entering an industry believes that
  the retaliation of an existing firm will be so great as to prevent entry, or mean that entry
  would be too costly, this is also a barrier. Retaliation could take the form of a price war or
  a marketing blitz. Just the knowledge that incumbents are prepared to retaliate is often
  sufficiently discouraging to act as a barrier.

The threat of substitutes
Substitutes are products or services that offer the same or a similar function and benefit to an
industry’s own products or services, but have a different nature. For example, aluminium is a
substitute for steel; a tablet computer is a substitute for a laptop; charities can be substitutes
for public services. Managers often focus on their competitors in their own industry, and
neglect the threat posed by substitutes. Substitutes can reduce demand for a particular type
of product as customers switch to alternatives – even to the extent that this type of product
or service becomes obsolete. However, there does not have to be much actual switching for
the substitute threat to have an effect. The simple risk of substitution puts a cap on the prices
that can be charged in an industry. Thus, although Eurostar trains has no direct competitors
in terms of train services from Paris to London, the prices it can charge are ultimately limited
by the cost of flights between the two cities.
    There are two important points to bear in mind about substitutes:

• Extra-industry effects are the core of the substitution concept. Substitutes come from
  outside the incumbents’ industry and should not be confused with competitors’ threats
  from within the industry. The value of the substitution concept is to force managers to
  look outside their own industry to consider more distant threats and constraints. If the
  buyers’ switching costs for the substitute are low the threat increases. The higher the
  threat, the less attractive the industry is likely to be.
• The price/performance ratio is critical to substitution threats. A substitute is still an
  effective threat even if more expensive, so long as it offers performance advantages
  that customers value. Thus aluminium is more expensive than steel, but its relative
  lightness and its resistance to corrosion give it an advantage in some automobile manu-
  facturing applications. It is the ratio of price to performance that matters, rather than
  simple price.


The power of buyers
Buyers are the organisation’s immediate customers, not necessarily the ultimate consumers.
If buyers are powerful, then they can demand low prices or costly product or service
improvements.
   Buyer power is likely to be high when some of the following four conditions prevail:

• Concentrated buyers. Where a few large customers account for the majority of sales, buyer
  power is increased. This is the case for items such as milk in the grocery sector in many
  European countries, where just a few retailers dominate the market. If a product or service
  accounts for a high percentage of total purchases of the buyer their power is also likely
  to increase as they are more likely to ‘shop around’ to get the best price and therefore
  ‘squeeze’ suppliers more than they would for more trivial purchases.
• Low switching costs. Where buyers can easily switch between one supplier and another,
  they have a strong negotiating position and can squeeze suppliers who are desperate
  for their business. Switching costs are typically low for standardized and undifferentiated
  products commodities such as steel. They are also likely to be low when the buyers are
  fully informed about prices and product performance.
• Buyer competition threat. If the buyer has the capability to supply itself, or if it has the
  possibility of acquiring such a capability, it tends to be powerful. In negotiation with its
  suppliers, it can raise the threat of doing the suppliers’ job themselves. This is called back-
  ward vertical integration (see Section 8.5), moving back to sources of supply, and might
  occur if satisfactory prices or quality from suppliers cannot be obtained. For example, some

                       steel companies have gained power over their iron ore suppliers as they have acquired
                       iron ore sources for themselves.
                    • Low buyer profits and impact on quality. For industrial or organisational buyers there are two
                      additional factors that can make them price sensitive and thus increase their threat: first, if
                      the buyer group is unprofitable and pressured to reduce purchasing costs and, second, if
                      the quality of the buyer’s product or services is little affected by the purchased product.

                    It is very important that buyers are distinguished from ultimate consumers. Thus for
                    companies like Procter & Gamble or Unilever (makers of shampoo, washing powders and
                    so on), their buyers are retailers such as Carrefour or Tesco, not ordinary consumers. Carre-
                    four and Tesco have much more negotiating power than an ordinary consumer would
                    have. The high buying power of such supermarkets is a strategic issue for the companies
                    supplying them. It is often useful therefore to distinguish ‘strategic customers’, powerful
                    buyers (such as the retailers) towards whom the strategy should be primarily orientated.
                    In the public sector, the strategic customer is typically the provider of funds, rather than
                    the consumer of services: for a pharmaceutical company, the strategic customer is the
                    hospital, not the patient.

                    The power of suppliers
                    Suppliers are those who supply the organisation with what it needs to produce the product
                    or service. As well as fuel, raw materials and equipment, this can include labour and sources
                    of finance. The factors increasing supplier power are the converse to those for buyer power.
                    Thus supplier power is likely to be high where there are:

                    • Concentrated suppliers. Where just a few producers dominate supply, suppliers have more
                      power over buyers. The iron ore industry is now concentrated in the hands of three main
                      producers, leaving the steel companies, still relatively fragmented, in a weak negotiating
                      position for this essential raw material.
                    • High switching costs. If it is expensive or disruptive to move from one supplier to another,
                      then the buyer becomes relatively dependent and correspondingly weak. Microsoft is
                      a powerful supplier because of the high switching costs of moving from one operating
                      system to another. Buyers are prepared to pay a premium to avoid the trouble, and Micro-
                      soft knows it.
                    • Supplier competition threat. Suppliers have increased power where they are able to enter
                      the industry themselves or cut out buyers who are acting as intermediaries. Thus airlines
                      have been able to negotiate tough contracts with travel agencies as the rise of online
                      booking has allowed them to create a direct route to customers. This is called forward
                      vertical integration, moving up closer to the ultimate customer.
                    • Differentiated products. When the products or services are highly differentiated, suppliers
                      will be more powerful. For example, although discount retailers like Walmart are extremely
                      powerful, suppliers with strong brands, like P&G with Gilette, still have high negotiating
                      power. Also, if there is no or few substitutes for the input the supplier group will be more
                      powerful, like pilots’ unions in the airline industry.

                    Most organisations have many suppliers, so it is necessary to concentrate the analysis on
                    the most important ones or types. If their power is high, suppliers can capture all their
                    buyers’ own potential profits simply by raising their prices. Star football players have
                    succeeded in raising their rewards to astronomical levels, while even the leading football
                    clubs – their ‘buyers’ – struggle to make money. Similarly, pilots’ unions have significant
                    power over airlines.

3.2.3 Complementors and network effects
Some industries may need the understanding of a sixth factor (or ‘force’), organisations
or companies that are complementors rather than simple competitors. An organisation
is your complementor if it enhances your business attractiveness to customers or
suppliers.4 On the demand side, if customers value a product or service more when they
also have the other organisation’s product there is a complementarity with respect to
customers. For example, app providers are complementors to Apple and other smart-
phone and tablet suppliers because customers value the iPhone and iPad more if there
are a wide variety of appealing apps to download. This suggests that Apple and other
actors in this industry need to take the app providers into consideration when forming
their strategies. On the supply side another organisation is a complementor with respect
to suppliers if it is more attractive for a supplier to deliver when it also supplies the
other organisation. This suggests that competing airline companies, for example, can
be complementary to each other in this respect because for a supplier like Boeing it
is more attractive to invest in particular improvements for two customers rather than
one. Complementarity implies a significant shift in perspective. While Porter’s Five Forces
sees organisations as battling against each other for share of industry value, comple-
mentors may cooperate to increase the total value available. Hence, this suggests that
both value-creating cooperation as well as competition need to be considered in an
industry analysis: this combination of competition and collaboration together is some-
times described as co-opetition.5
   Customers may not only value a product more if they also have another product or
service as discussed above, but if other customers use the same product or service. When
this is the case the product or service shows network effects or network externalities.
There are network effects in an industry when one customer of a product or service
has a positive effect on the value of that product for other customers. This implies
that the more customers that use the product, the better for everyone in the customer
network.6 For example, the value of the online auction site eBay increases for a customer
as the network of other sellers and buyers grows on the site. The more goods that are
offered on the site, the better for customers and this makes eBay’s site and services more
attractive to users than smaller competitors. Network effects are very important for
Facebook too (see Illustration 3.2). Network effects can make an industry structurally
attractive with high barriers to entry, low intensity of rivalry and power over buyers as
entrants and rivals can’t compete with other companies’ larger networks and buyers
become locked into them. If these effects are present in an industry they need to be
carefully analysed to understand the industry structure and strategic positioning.7 For
hardware and software computer products the number of users in a network is often
referred to as an ‘installed base’.
   In some industries complementors and network effects work in tandem. In the smart-
phone and tablet industries, for example, they operate in two steps. First, app providers
are complementors to Apple as customers are more attracted to the iPhone and iPad if
there are many apps. Second, when more customers are attracted to these products the
network of users grows, which increases the user value even further. For Apple then the
complementary app providers attract more users and this in turn provides for network
effects that attract even further users. Other industries where competitors need to
consider both complementors and network effects are video gaming (e.g. Nintendo) and
computer operation systems industries (e.g. Microsoft). These two latter industries are
sometimes considered to be ‘platform’ businesses and this is discussed in Chapter 7 (see
Section 7.4.2).

3.2.4 Implications of the Competitive Five Forces
The Five Forces Framework provides several useful insights into the forces at work in the
industry or market environment of an organisation. The objective is more than simply listing
the strength of the forces and their underlying driving factors. It is rather to determine
whether the industry is a good one to compete in or not and to conclude whether there are
advantageous strategic positions where an organisation can defend itself against strong
competitive forces, can exploit weak ones or can influence the forces in its favour. The aim
of the five forces analysis is thus an assessment of the attractiveness of the industry and any
possibilities to manage strategies in relation to the forces to promote long-term survival
and competitive advantage. As Illustration 3.3 shows, these considerations make up the last
three steps in an industry analysis together with an assessment of industry change, which is
discussed in the next section. When each of the five forces has been evaluated, the next step
is thus to understand the implications of these:

• Which industries to enter (or leave)? One important purpose of the Five Forces Framework
  is to identify the relative attractiveness of different industries: industries are attractive
  when the forces are weak. In general, entrepreneurs and managers should invest in indus-
  tries where the five forces work in their favour and avoid, or disinvest from, markets where
  they are strongly unfavourable. Entrepreneurs sometimes choose markets because entry
  barriers are low: unless barriers are likely to rise quickly, this is precisely the wrong reason to
  enter. Here it is important to note that just one significantly adverse force can be enough
  to undermine the attractiveness of the industry as a whole. For example, powerful buyers
  can extract all the potential profits of an otherwise attractive industry structure by forcing
  down prices. Chapter 8 further examines these strategic choices and corporate strategy and
  what to consider when deciding whether to invest into or divest out of various industries.
• How can the five forces be managed? Industry structures are not necessarily fixed but can
  be influenced by deliberate managerial strategies. Managers should identify strategic
  positions where the organisation best can defend itself against strong competitive forces,
  can exploit weak ones or can influence them. As a general rule, managers should try to
  influence and exploit any weak forces to its advantage and neutralise any strong ones.
  For example, if barriers to entry are low, an organisation can raise them by increasing
  advertising spending to improve customer loyalty. Managers can buy up competitors to
  reduce rivalry and to increase power over suppliers or buyers. If buyers are very strong,
  an organisation can try to differentiate products or services for a specific customer group
  and thus increase their loyalty and switching costs. One approach to finding differenti-
  ated positions that include weaker forces is ‘Blue Ocean’ thinking, which is discussed in
  Section 3.4.3 below. Managing and influencing industry structure involves many issues
  relating to strategic choices and business strategy and will be a major concern of Chapter 7.
• How are competitors affected differently? Not all competitors will be affected equally by
  changes in industry structure, deliberate or spontaneous. If barriers are rising because of
  increased R&D or advertising spending, smaller players in the industry may not be able to
  keep up with the larger players and be squeezed out. Similarly, growing buyer power is likely
  to hurt small competitors most. Strategic group analysis is helpful here (see Section 3.4.1).

Although originating in the private sector, five forces analysis can have important implications
for organisations in the public and charity sectors too. For example, the forces can be used to
adjust the service offer or focus on key issues. Thus, it might be worth switching focus from
an arena with many crowded and overlapping services (e.g. social work, probation services
and education) to one that is less rivalrous and where the organisation can do something
more distinctive. Similarly, strategies could be launched to reduce dependence on particularly
powerful and expensive suppliers, for example energy sources or high-shortage skills.

                                                                                                  73

3.3 Industry types and dynamics
                       The Five Forces Framework is the most well-known strategy tool for industry analysis, but it
                       has to be used carefully. First, industry types and their underlying economic characteristics
                       should be considered as they have major implications on industry attractiveness and what
                       competitive strategies are available. Second, even though industry structures are typically
                       fairly stable they do change, and some can be in flux for considerable periods of time. This
                       suggests that basic industry types and industry dynamics in competitive forces need to be
                       considered. This section thus first examines fundamental industry types and then industry
                       change and dynamics.


                       3.3.1 Industry types
                       The Five Forces Framework builds on theories in economics8 and it helps to identify the main
                       types of industry structure. They vary from consolidated industries with just one or a few
                       firms with high profitability to fragmented ones with many, sometimes thousands, firms
                       with lower profitability (see Table 3.1). In practice, particular industries are typically not pure
                       representatives of these types, but nonetheless it is helpful to have these broad categories
                       in mind in order to compare the attractiveness of industries and likely broad patterns of
                       competitive behaviour within them. Three basic types are:

                       • Monopoly. A monopoly is formally an industry with just one firm with a unique product or
                         service and therefore no competitive rivalry. Because of the lack of choice between rivals
                         and few entrants, there is potentially very great power over buyers and suppliers. This can
                         be very profitable. Firms can still have monopoly power where they are simply the dominant
                         competitor: for example, Google has at least 65% market share of the American search
                         engine market (some sources state 90%), which gives it price-setting power in the internet
                         advertising market. Some industries are monopolistic because of economies of scale: water
                         utility companies are often monopolies in a particular area because it is uneconomic for
                         smaller players to compete. For this reason the government sometimes gives one firm the
                         right to be the only supplier of a product or service. Other industries are monopolistic
                         because of ‘network effects’, where a product is more valuable because of the number of
                         other people using it: Facebook and Microsoft Office are so powerful precisely because so
                         many are already users.9 See Illustration 3.2 for a discussion of Facebook’s dominance.
                       • Oligopoly. An oligopoly is where just a few often large firms dominate an industry, with
                         the potential for limited rivalry and threat of entrants and great power over buyers and

                       suppliers. With only a few competitors the actions of any one firm are likely highly influ-
                       ential on the others: therefore all firms must carefully consider the actions of all others.
                       The iron ore market is an oligopoly, dominated by Vale, Rio Tinto and BHP Billiton. In
                       theory, oligopoly can be highly profitable, but much depends on the extent of rivalrous
                       behaviour, the threat of entry and substitutes and the growth of final demand in key
                       markets. Oligopolistic firms have a strong interest in minimising rivalry between each
                       other so as to maintain a common front against buyers and suppliers.10 Where there are
                       just two oligopolistic rivals, as for Airbus and Boeing in the civil airline industry, the situ-
                       ation is a duopoly.
                    • Perfect competition. Perfect competition exists where barriers to entry are low, there are
                      countless equal rivals each with close to identical products or services, and information
                      about prices, products and competitors is perfectly available. Competition focuses heavily
                      on price, because products are so similar and competitors typically cannot fund major
                      innovations or marketing initiatives to make them dissimilar. Under these conditions,
                      firms are unable to earn more profit than the bare minimum required to survive. Agri-
                      culture often comes close to perfect competition (e.g. potatoes, apples, onions, etc.) and
                      so do street food vendors in major cities. Few markets, however, are absolutely perfectly
                      competitive. Markets are more commonly slightly imperfect so that products can be differ-
                      entiated to a certain degree and with information not completely available for everyone.
                      A number of small firm service industries rather have this character, such as restaurants,
                      pubs, hairdressers, shoe repairs, but also the shampoo, cereal and toothpaste markets.11

                       It has also been argued that there are ‘hypercompetitive industries’. Hypercompetition
                    occurs where the frequency, boldness and aggression of competitor interactions accelerate
                    to create a condition of constant disequilibrium and change.12 Under hypercompetition,
                    rivals tend to invest heavily in destabilising innovation, expensive marketing initiatives and
                    aggressive price cuts, with negative impacts on profits. Hypercompetition often breaks out in
                    otherwise oligopolistic industries. Competitive moves under conditions of hypercompetition
                    are discussed in Section 7.4.2.
                       Industry structures change over time and industries can evolve from one type to another,
                    depending on the macro-environment, the degree of industry maturity and competitive
                    strategies in the industry with consequences for competitive force strengths. These industry
                    dynamics are discussed next.


                    3.3.2 Industry structure dynamics
                    Industry structure analysis can easily become too static: after all, structure implies stability.13
                    However, industries are not always stable. To begin with industry borders can change over
                    time and this needs to be considered when first defining an industry. For example, many
                    industries, especially in high-tech arenas, are converging. Convergence is where previously
                    separate industries begin to overlap or merge in terms of activities, technologies, products
                    and customers.14 Technological change has brought convergence between the telephone,
                    photographic and the PC industries, for example, as mobile phones have become smart-
                    phones and include camera and video, e-mailing and document editing functions. Hence,
                    companies that once were in separate industries, such as Samsung in mobile phones, Sony
                    in cameras and Apple in computers, are now in the same smartphone industry.
                       As discussed in the previous chapter the broader macro environment also tends to influ-
                    ence the more specific industry environment through changes in the industry structure.
                    These key drivers for change are likely to alter the industry and scenario analyses can be
                    used to understand possible impacts (see Section 2.4). An illustration of changing industry
                    structure, and the competitive implications of this, is provided by Illustration 3.4 on the UK

                    charity and public sector. This sub-section examines two additional approaches to under-
                    standing change in industry structure: the industry life-cycle concept and comparative five
                    forces analyses.

                    The industry life cycle
                    The industry life-cycle concept proposes that industries start small in their development or
                    introduction stage, then go through a period of rapid growth (the equivalent to ‘adoles-
                    cence’ in the human life cycle), culminating in a period of ‘shake-out’. The final two stages
                    are first a period of slow or even zero growth (‘maturity’), and then the final stage of decline
                    (‘old age’). The power of the five forces typically varies with the stages of the industry life
                    cycle (see Figure 3.3).15
                       The development stage is an experimental one, typically with few players, little direct
                    rivalry and highly differentiated products. The five forces are likely to be weak, therefore,
                    though profits may actually be scarce because of high investment requirements. The next
                    stage is one of high growth, with rivalry low as there is plenty of market opportunity for
                    everybody. Low rivalry and keen buyers of the new product favour profits at this stage,
                    but these are not certain. Barriers to entry may still be low in the growth stage, as existing
                    competitors have not built up much scale, experience or customer loyalty. Suppliers can be
                    powerful too if there is a shortage of components or materials that fast-growing businesses
                    need for expansion. The shake-out stage begins as the market becomes increasingly satur-
                    ated and cluttered with competitors (see Illustration 3.4). Profits are variable, as increased
                    rivalry forces the weakest competitors out of the business. In the maturity stage, barriers
                    to entry tend to increase, as control over distribution is established and economies of scale
                    and experience curve benefits come into play. Products or services tend to standardise, with
                    relative price becoming key. Buyers may become more powerful as they become less avid
                    for the industry’s products and more confident in switching between suppliers. Profitability
                    at the maturity stage relies on high market share, providing leverage against buyers and
                    competitive advantage in terms of cost. The decline stage can be a period of extreme rivalry,

                    especially where there are high exit barriers, as falling sales force remaining competitors into
                    dog-eat-dog competition. However, survivors in the decline stage may still be profitable if
                    competitor exit leaves them in a monopolistic position. Figure 3.3 summarises some of the
                    conditions that can be expected at different stages in the life cycle.
                       It is important to avoid putting too much faith in the inevitability of life-cycle stages. One
                    stage does not follow predictably after another. First, industries vary widely in the length
                    of their growth stages. Many internet-based industries have matured quickly and moved
                    through the stages in less than a decade, for example online travel and dating services.
                    Second, some industries can rapidly ‘de-mature’ through radical innovation. Thus, the tele-
                    phony industry, based for nearly a century on fixed-line telephones, rejuvenated rapidly with
                    the introduction of mobile and internet telephony. Likewise, since the mobile telephony
                    handset industry matured it has later been revived by the introduction of smartphones
                    and smartwatches. Anita McGahan of Toronto University warns of the ‘maturity mindset’,
                    which can leave many managers complacent and slow to respond to new competition.16
                    Managing in mature industries is thus not necessarily just about waiting for decline, but
                    making efforts to reinvent products, services and strategies over time in a potential rejuvena-
                    tion into a new life cycle. For example, Netflix was active in the DVD rental services industry,
                    but did not wait for it to decline and die and instead rejuvenated itself as an online movie
                    and TV show company. It thus now finds itself in a reinvented streaming-content industry
                    together with Amazon and others. However, even if the various stages are not inevitable,
                    the life-cycle concept does remind managers that conditions are likely to change over time.
                    Especially in fast-moving industries, five forces analyses need to be reviewed quite regularly.

                    Comparative industry structure analyses
                    The previous section raised the issue of how competitive forces may change over time. The
                    industry life cycle thus underlines the need to make industry structure analysis dynamic.
                    This implies that we not only need to understand the current strength of the competitive
                    forces, but how it may change over time. One effective means of doing this is to compare
                    the competitive five forces over time in a simple ‘radar plot’.
                        Figure 3.4 provides a framework for summarising the power of each of the five forces
                    on five axes. Power diminishes as the axes go outwards. Where the forces are low, the total
                    area enclosed by the lines between the axes is large; where the forces are high, the total area
                    enclosed by the lines is small. The larger the enclosed area, therefore, the greater is the profit
                    potential. In Figure 3.4, the industry at Time 0 (represented by the red lines) has relatively
                    low rivalry (just a few competitors) and faces low substitution threats. The threat of entry is
                    moderate, but both buyer power and supplier power are relatively high. Overall, this looks
                    like only a moderately attractive industry to invest in.
                        However, given the dynamic nature of industries, managers need to look forward.
                    Figure 3.4 represents five years forward by the green lines. Managers are predicting in this
                    case some rise in the threat of substitutes (perhaps new technologies will be developed).
                    On the other hand, they predict a falling entry threat, while both buyer power and supplier
                    power will be easing. Rivalry will reduce still further. This looks like a classic case of an industry
                    in which a few players emerge with overall dominance. The area enclosed by the green lines
                    is large, suggesting a relatively attractive industry. For a firm confident of becoming one of
                    the dominant players, this might be an industry well worth investing in.
                        Comparing the five forces over time on a radar plot thus helps to give industry structure anal-
                    ysis a dynamic aspect. Similar plots can be made to aid diversification decisions (see Chapter 8),
                    where possible new industries to enter can be compared in terms of attractiveness. The lines
                    are only approximate, of course, because they aggregate the many individual elements that
                    make up each of the forces into a simple composite measure. Notice too that if one of the
                    forces is very adverse, then this might nullify positive assessments on the other four axes: for
                    example, an industry with low rivalry, low substitution, low entry barriers and low supplier

                    for initial analysis and an effective summary of a final, more refined and dynamic analysis.



3.4 Competitors and markets
                    An industry or sector may be too high a level to provide for a detailed understanding of
                    competition. The five forces can impact differently on different kinds of players, requiring a
                    more fine-grained understanding. For example, Hyundai and Porsche may be in the same
                    broad industry (automobiles), but they are positioned differently: they are protected by
                    different barriers to entry and competitive moves by one are unlikely to affect the other.
                    It is often useful to disaggregate. Many industries contain a range of companies, each of
                    which have different capabilities and compete on different bases. Some of these competitor
                    differences are captured by the concept of strategic groups. Customers too can differ signifi-
                    cantly, and these can be captured by distinguishing between different market segments.
                    Thinking in terms of different strategic groups and market segments provides opportunities
                    for organisations to develop highly distinctive positionings within broader industries. Besides
                    disaggregating the analysis of industry competition these approaches may help in under-
                    standing how value is created differently by different competitors. Competitor differences,
                    both actual and potential, including the identification of entirely new market spaces can also
                    be analysed using the strategy canvas and ‘Blue Ocean’ thinking, the last topic in this section.


                    3.4.1 Strategic groups
                    Strategic groups are organisations within the same industry or sector with similar stra-
                    tegic characteristics, following similar strategies or competing on similar bases.17 These
                    characteristics are different from those in other strategic groups in the same industry or

Figure 3.5 Characteristics for identifying strategic groups



             Strategic dimensions are based on the extent to which
             organisations differ in terms of characteristics such as:


                 Scope of activities

             •   Extent of product (or service) range
             •   Extent of geographical coverage (e.g. national, regional, global)
             •   Number of market segments served
             •   Distribution channels used



                 Resource commitment

             •   Extent (number) of branding
             •   Marketing effort (e.g. advertising spread, size of salesforce)
             •   Extent of vertical integration
             •   Product or service quality
             •   R&D spending and technological leadership (leader vs. follower)
             •   Size of organisation




sector. For example, in the grocery retailing industry, supermarkets, convenience stores and
corner shops each form different strategic groups. There are many different characteristics
that distinguish between strategic groups and these can be grouped into two major catego-
ries of strategic dimensions (see Figure 3.5).18 First, the scope of an organisation’s activities
(such as product range, geographical coverage and range of distribution channels used).
Second, the resource commitment (such as brands, marketing spend and extent of vertical
integration). Which characteristics are relevant differs from industry to industry, but typically
important are those characteristics that separate high performers from low performers. It
helps to make a competitive force analysis first as it identifies different types of rivals.
   Strategic groups can be mapped onto two-dimensional charts – for example, one axis
might be the extent of product range and the other axis the size of marketing spend.
One method for choosing key dimensions by which to map strategic groups is to identify
top performers (by growth or profitability) in an industry and to compare them with low
performers. Characteristics that are shared by top performers, but not by low performers, are
likely to be particularly relevant for mapping strategic groups. For example, the most profit-
able firms in an industry might all be narrow in terms of product range, and lavish in terms
of marketing spend, while the less profitable firms might be more widely spread in terms
of products and restrained in their marketing. Here the two dimensions for mapping would
be product range and marketing spend. A potential recommendation for the less profitable
firms would be to cut back their product range and boost their marketing.19
   Figure 3.6 shows strategic groups among Indian pharmaceutical companies, with research
and development intensity (R&D spend as a percentage of sales) and overseas focus (exports
and patents registered overseas) defining the axes of the map. These two axes do explain
a good deal of the variation in profitability between groups. The most profitable group is
the Emergent globals (11.3 per cent average return on sales), those with high R&D intensity
and high overseas focus. On the other hand, the Exploiter group spends little on R&D and is
focused on domestic markets, and only enjoys 2.0 per cent average return on sales.
                                                                                              81

                    group analysis’, Journal of International Management, vol. 13 (2009), pp. 338–55.



                       This strategic group concept is useful in at least three ways:

                    • Understanding competition. Managers can focus on their direct competitors within their
                      particular strategic group, rather than the whole industry as rivalry often is strongest
                      between these. In general, strategic groups are influenced differently by the competitive
                      forces and this focus thus allows for a more specific industry structure analysis. They can
                      also establish the dimensions that distinguish them most from other groups, and which
                      might be the basis for relative success or failure. This suggests that there may be profit-
                      ability differences between different strategic groups and the differing dimensions can
                      then become the focus of their action.
                    • Analysis of strategic opportunities. Strategic group maps can identify the most attractive
                      ‘strategic spaces’ within an industry. Some spaces on the map may be ‘white spaces’,
                      relatively under-occupied. In the Indian pharmaceutical industry, the white space is high
                      R&D investment combined with focus on domestic markets. Such white spaces might be
                      unexploited opportunities. On the other hand, they could turn out to be ‘black holes’,
                      impossible to exploit and likely to damage any entrant. A strategic group map is only the
                      first stage of the analysis. Strategic spaces need to be tested carefully.
                    • Analysis of mobility barriers. Of course, moving across the strategic group map to take
                      advantage of opportunities is not costless. Often it will require difficult decisions and rare
                      resources. Strategic groups are therefore characterised by ‘mobility barriers’, obstacles
                      to movement from one strategic group to another. These are the equivalent to barriers
                      to entry in five forces analysis, but between different strategic groups within the same
                      industry.

                     Although movement from the Exploiter group in Indian pharmaceuticals to the Emer-
                     gent global group might seem very attractive in terms of profits, it is likely to demand very
                     substantial financial investment and strong managerial skills. Mobility into the Emergent
                     global group will not be easy. As with barriers to entry, it is good to be in a successful strategic
                     group protected by strong mobility barriers, to impede imitation.


                     3.4.2 Market segments
                     The concept of strategic groups discussed above helps with understanding the similarities
                     and differences in terms of competitor characteristics. Industries can also be disaggregated
                     into smaller and specific market sections known as segments. The concept of market segment
                     focuses on differences in customer needs. A market segment20 is a group of customers who
                     have similar needs that are different from customer needs in other parts of the market.
                     Where these customer groups are relatively small, such market segments are often called
                     ‘niches’. Dominance of a market segment or niche can be very valuable, for the same reasons
                     that dominance of an industry can be valuable following five forces reasoning.
                        Segmentation should reflect an organisation’s strategy21 and strategies based on market
                     segments must keep customer needs firmly in mind. Therefore, two issues are particularly
                     important in market segment analysis:

                     • Variation in customer needs. Focusing on customer needs that are highly distinctive
                       from those typical in the market is one means of building a long-term segment strategy.
                       Customer needs vary for a whole variety of reasons – some of which are identified in
                       Table 3.1. Theoretically, any of these factors could be used to identify distinct market
                       segments. However, the crucial bases of segmentation vary according to market. In
                       industrial markets, segmentation is often thought of in terms of industrial classifi-
                       cation of buyers: steel producers might segment by automobile industry, packaging
                       industry and construction industry, for example. On the other hand, segmentation by
                       buyer behaviour (e.g. direct buying versus those users who buy through third parties

                       such as contractors) or purchase value (e.g. high-value bulk purchasers versus frequent
                       low-value purchasers) might be more appropriate. Being able to serve a highly distinc-
                       tive segment that other organisations find difficult to serve is often the basis for a secure
                       long-term strategy.
                    • Specialisation within a market segment can also be an important basis for a successful
                      segmentation strategy. This is sometimes called a ‘niche strategy’. Organisations that have
                      built up most experience in servicing a particular market segment should not only have
                      lower costs in so doing, but also have built relationships which may be difficult for others
                      to break down. Experience and relationships are likely to protect a dominant position
                      in a particular segment. However, precisely because customers value different things in
                      different segments, specialised producers may find it very difficult to compete on a broader
                      basis. For example, a small local brewery competing against the big brands on the basis of
                      its ability to satisfy distinctive local tastes is unlikely to find it easy to serve other segments
                      where tastes are different, scale requirements are larger and distribution channels are
                      more complex.



                    3.4.3 Critical success factors and ‘Blue Oceans’
                    Industry or sector analysis should also include an understanding of competitors and the
                    different ways they offer value to customers. As Michael Porter’s Five Forces Framework
                    underlines, reducing industry rivalry involves competitors finding differentiated positions in
                    the marketplace. W. Chan Kim and Renée Mauborgne at INSEAD propose two concepts that
                    help think creatively about the relative positioning of competitors in the environment and
                    finding uncontested market spaces: the strategy canvas and ‘Blue Oceans’.22
                       A strategy canvas compares competitors according to their performance on key success
                    factors in order to establish the extent of differentiation. It captures the current factors of
                    competition of the industry, but also offers ways of challenging these and creatively trying
                    to identify new competitive offerings. Figure 3.7 shows a strategy canvas for three electrical
                    components companies. The canvas highlights the following three features:

                    • Critical success factors (CSFs) are those factors that either are particularly valued by
                      customers (i.e. strategic customers) or provide a significant advantage in terms of cost.
                      Critical success factors are therefore likely to be an important source of competitive advan-
                      tage or disadvantage. Figure 3.7 identifies five established critical success factors in this
                      electrical components market (cost, after-sales service, delivery reliability, technical quality
                      and testing facilities). Note there is also a new sixth critical success factor, design advisory
                      services, which will be discussed under the third subhead, value innovation.
                    • Value curves are a graphic depiction of how customers perceive competitors’ relative
                      performance across the critical success factors. In Figure 3.7, companies A and B perform
                      well on cost, service, reliability and quality, but less well on testing. They do not offer any
                      design advice. They are poorly differentiated and occupy a space in the market where
                      profits may be hard to get because of excessive rivalry between the two. Company C, on
                      the other hand, has a radically different value curve, characteristic of a ‘value innovator’.
                    • Value innovation is the creation of new market space by excelling on established critical
                      success factors on which competitors are performing badly and/or by creating new critical
                      success factors representing previously unrecognised customer wants. Thus in Figure 3.7,
                      company C is a value innovator in both senses. First, it excels on the established customer
                      need of offering testing facilities for customers’ products using its components. Second,
                      it offers a new and valued design service advising customers on how to integrate their
                      components in order for them to create better products.

          A value innovator is a company that competes in ‘Blue Oceans’. Blue Oceans are new market
          spaces where competition is minimised.23 Blue Oceans contrast with ‘Red Oceans’, where
          industries are already well defined and rivalry is intense. Blue Oceans evoke wide empty seas.
          Red Oceans are associated with bloody competition and ‘red ink’, in other words financial
          losses. The Blue Ocean concept is thus useful for identifying potential spaces in the environ-
          ment with little competition. These Blue Oceans are strategic gaps in the marketplace.
              In Figure 3.7, company C’s strategy exemplifies two critical principles of Blue Ocean
          thinking: focus and divergence. First, company C focuses its efforts on just two factors,
          testing and design services, while maintaining only adequate performance on the other
          critical success factors where its competitors are already high performers. Second, it has
          created a value curve that significantly diverges from its competitors’ value curves, creating
          a substantial strategic gap, or Blue Ocean, in the areas of testing and design services. This is
          shrewd. For company C, beating companies A and B in the areas where they are performing
          well anyway would require major investment and likely provide little advantage given that
          customers are already highly satisfied. Challenging A and B on cost, after-sales service,
          delivery or quality would be a Red Ocean strategy, increasing industry rivalry. Far better
          is to concentrate on where a large gap can be created between competitors. Company C
          faces little competition for those customers who really value testing and design services,
          and consequently can charge good prices for them. The task for companies A and B now is
          to find strategic gaps of their own.



3.5 Opportunities and threats
          The concepts and frameworks discussed above and in Chapter 2 should be helpful in
          understanding the factors in the macro-, industry and competitor/market environments
          of an organisation. However, the critical issue is the implications that are drawn from this
          understanding in guiding strategic decisions and choices. The crucial next stage, therefore,
          is to draw from the environmental analysis specific strategic opportunities and threats for
          the organisation. Identifying these opportunities and threats is extremely valuable when

                     ities and threats form one half of the Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities and Threats
                     (SWOT) analyses that shape many companies’ strategy formulation (see Section 4.4.4). In
                     responding strategically to the environment, the goal is to reduce identified threats and take
                     advantage of the best opportunities.
                         The techniques and concepts in this and the previous chapter should help in identifying
                     environmental threats and opportunities, for instance:

                     • PESTEL analysis of the macro-environment might reveal threats and opportunities
                       presented by technological change, or shifts in market demographics or such like factors
                       (see Chapter 2).
                     • Identification of key drivers for change can help generate different scenarios for managerial
                       discussion, some more threatening and others more favourable.
                     • Porter’s five forces analysis might, for example, identify a rise or fall in barriers to entry, or
                       opportunities to reduce industry rivalry, perhaps by acquisition of competitors.
                     • Blue Ocean thinking might reveal where companies can create new market spaces; alter-
                       natively, it could help identify success factors which new entrants might attack in order
                       to turn ‘Blue Oceans’ into ‘Red Oceans’.

                     While all these techniques and concepts are important tools for understanding environments,
                     it is important to recognise that any analysis is likely to be somewhat subjective. Entrepren-
                     eurs and managers often have particular blinkers with regard to what they see and prioritise.
                     Techniques and concepts can be helpful in challenging existing assumptions and encour-
                     aging broader perspectives, but they are unlikely to overcome human subjectivity and biases
                     completely.

Summary
• The environment influence closest to an organisation includes the industry or sector
  (middle layer in Figure 2.1).
• Industries and sectors can be analysed in terms of Porter’s five forces – barriers to entry,
  substitutes, buyer power, supplier power and rivalry. Together with complementors these
  determine industry or sector attractiveness and possible ways of managing strategy.
• Industries and sectors are dynamic, and their changes can be analysed in terms of the
  industry life cycle and comparative five forces radar plots.
• Within industries strategic group analysis and market segment analysis can help identify
  strategic gaps or opportunities (the inner layers in Figure 2.1).
• Blue Ocean strategies are a means of neutralising strong competitive forces and thus
  avoiding Red Oceans with many similar rivals and low profitability and can be analysed
  with a strategy canvas.




Work assignments
✱ Denotes more advanced work assignments.
* Refers to a case study in the Text and Cases edition.

3.1   Drawing on Section 3.2, carry out a five forces analysis of the pharmaceutical
      industry* or SAB Miller’s position in the brewing industry (Megabrew*). What do you
      conclude about that industry’s attractiveness?
3.2   Drawing on Section 3.2.3, identify an industry with network effects. Consider what
      those might involve; why customers prefer certain services, products and companies
      over others and why they may not easily switch to other services and companies.
3.3✱ Drawing on Section 3.3, and particularly using the radar plot technique of
     Figure 3.4, choose two industries or sectors and compare their attractiveness in
     terms of the five forces (a) today; (b) in approximately three to five years’ time.
     Justify your assessment of each of the five forces’ strengths. Which industry or sector
     would you invest in?
3.4   With regard to Section 3.4.1 and Figure 3.6, identify an industry (e.g. the car industry
      or clothing retailers) and, by comparing competitors, map out the main strategic
      groups in the industry according to key strategic dimensions. Try more than one set
      of key strategic dimensions to map the industry. Do the resulting maps identify any
      under-exploited opportunities in the industry?
3.5✱ Drawing on Section 3.4.3, and particularly on Figure 3.7, identify critical success
     factors for an industry with which you and your peers are familiar (e.g. clothing
     retailers or mobile phone companies). Using your own estimates (or those of your
     peers), construct a strategy canvas comparing the main competitors, as in Figure 3.7.
     What implications does your strategy canvas have for the strategies of these
     competitors?

Integrative assignment
3.6✱ Carry out a full analysis of an industry or sector of your choice (using for example five
     forces and strategic groups). Consider explicitly how the industry or sector is affected
     by globalisation (see Chapter 9, particularly Figure 9.2 on drivers) and innovation
     (see Chapter 10, particularly Figure 10.5 on product and process innovation).

4.1 Introduction
          Chapters 2 and 3 emphasised the importance of the external environment of an organisation
          and how it can create both strategic opportunities and threats. However, it is not only the
          external environment that matters for strategy; there are also differences between organisa-
          tions that need to be considered. For example, manufacturers of saloon cars compete within
          the same industry and within the same technological environment, but with markedly different
          success. BMW has been consistently successful based on its engineering capabilities and brand.
          Chrysler has found it more difficult to maintain its competitive position and others, like SAAB
          cars in Sweden, have gone out of business. It is not so much the characteristics of the environ-
          ment which explain these differences in performance, but differences in organisation-specific
          resources and capabilities. This puts the focus on variations between companies within the same
          environment and how they vary in their resources and capabilities arrangements.1 It is the stra-
          tegic importance of organisations’ resources and capabilities that is the focus of this chapter.
             Two key notions underlie the analysis of resources and capabilities. The first is that organisa-
          tions are not identical but have different resources and capabilities; they are ‘heterogeneous’ in
          this respect. The second is that it can be difficult for one organisation to obtain or imitate the
          resources and capabilities of another. The implication for managers is that they need to under-
          stand how their organisations are different from their rivals in ways that may form the basis of
          sustainable competitive advantage and superior performance. These concepts underlie what
          has become known as the resource-based view (RBV) of strategy pioneered by Jay Barney
          at the University of Utah: that the competitive advantage and superior performance of an
          organisation are explained by the distinctiveness of its resources and capabilities.2
             The chapter has four further sections and the key issues posed by the chapter are
          summarised in Figure 4.1. Section 4.2 discusses the foundations of what resources and
          capabilities are. It also draws a distinction between threshold resources and capabilities
          required to compete in a market and distinctive resources and capabilities that may be a
          basis for achieving competitive advantage and superior performance.

          • Section 4.3 explains the ways in which distinctive resources and capabilities can contribute
            to sustained competitive advantage (in a public-sector context the equivalent concern
            might be how some organisations sustain relative superior performance over time). In
            particular, the importance of the Value, Rarity, Inimitability and Organisational support
            (VRIO) of resources and capabilities is explained.
          • Section 4.4 moves on to consider different ways resources and capabilities might be ana-
            lysed. These include VRIO analysis, value chain and value system analysis, activity systems

                       mapping and benchmarking. The section concludes by explaining the use of SWOT
                       analysis as a basis for pulling together the insights from the analyses of the environment
                       (explained in Chapter 2 and 3) and of resources and capabilities in this chapter.
                    • Finally, Section 4.5 discusses some of the key issues of dynamic capabilities and how
                      resources and capabilities can be created, developed and managed.



4.2 Foundations of resources and capabilities
                    Given that different writers, managers and consultants use different terms and concepts,
                    it is important to understand how concepts relating to resources and capabilities are
                    used in this book. The resources and capabilities of an organisation contribute to its
                    long-term survival and potentially to competitive advantage. However, to understand and
                    to manage resources and capabilities it is necessary to explain their components.3

                    4.2.1 Resources and capabilities
                    Resources are the assets that organisations have or can call upon and capabilities are the ways in
                    which those assets are deployed. A shorthand way of thinking of this distinction is that resources
                    are ‘what we have’ (nouns) and capabilities are ‘what we do’ (verbs).4 Other terms are sometimes
                    used, for example ‘capabilities’ and ‘competences’ are often used interchangeably (earlier editions
                    of this text used the term ‘competences’ for capabilities).5 Other writers use the term intangible
                    assets as an umbrella term to include capabilities as well as intangible resources such as brands.
                        Resources and capabilities are typically related, as Table 4.1 shows. Resources are certainly
                    important, but how an organisation employs and deploys its resources in the form of capabil-
                    ities matters at least as much for long-term survival. There would be no point in having
                    state-of-the-art equipment if it were not used effectively. The efficiency and effectiveness of
                    physical or financial resources, or the people in an organisation, depend not just on their exist-
                    ence, but on the systems and processes by which they are managed. These can, for example,
                    involve the relationships and cooperation between people, their adaptability, their innova-
                    tive capacity, the relationship with customers and suppliers, and the experience and learning
                    about what works well and what does not. Illustration 4.1 shows examples of how executives
                    explain the importance of the resources and capabilities of their different organisations.

                    4.2.2 Threshold and distinctive resources and capabilities
                    A distinction needs to be made between resources and capabilities that are at a threshold
                    level and those that might help the organisation achieve competitive advantage and
                    superior performance. Threshold resources and capabilities are those needed for an

                    organisation to meet the necessary requirements to compete at all in a given market
                    and achieve parity with competitors in that market. Without these the organisation could
                    not survive over time. For example, start-up businesses may simply not have or cannot obtain
                    the resources or capabilities needed to compete with established competitors. Identifying
                    threshold requirements is, however, also important for established businesses. There could
                    be changing threshold resources required to meet minimum customer requirements: for
                    example, the increasing demands by modern multiple retailers of their suppliers mean that
                    those suppliers must possess a quite sophisticated IT and digital infrastructure simply to
                    stand a chance of meeting retailer requirements. Or there could be threshold capabilities
                    required to deploy resources to meet customers’ requirements and support particular strat-
                    egies. Retailers do not simply expect suppliers to have the required digital infrastructure, but
                    to be able to use it effectively so as to guarantee the required level of service.
                       Identifying and managing threshold resources and capabilities raises a significant challenge
                    because threshold levels will change as critical success factors change (see Section 3.4.3) or
                    through the activities of competitors and new entrants. To continue the example above, suppliers
                    to major retailers did not require the same level of IT, digital and logistics support a decade ago.
                    But the retailers’ drive to reduce costs, improve efficiency and ensure availability of merchandise
                    to their customers means that their expectations of their suppliers have increased markedly in
                    that time and continue to do so. So, there is a need for those suppliers continuously to review and
                    improve their digital and logistics resource and capability base just to stay in business.
                       While threshold resources and capabilities are important, they do not of themselves create
                    competitive advantage or the basis of superior performance. They can be thought of as
                    ‘qualifiers’ to be able to compete at all with competitors while distinctive resources and
                    capabilities are ‘winners’ required to triumph over competitors. Distinctive resources and
                    capabilities are required to achieve competitive advantage. These are dependent on an
                    organisation having a distinctiveness or uniqueness that is of value to customers and which
                    competitors find difficult to imitate. This could be because the organisation has distinctive
                    resources that critically underpin competitive advantage and that others cannot imitate or
                    obtain – a long-established brand, for example. Or it could be that an organisation achieves
                    competitive advantage because it has distinctive capabilities – ways of doing things that are
                    unique to that organisation and effectively utilised so as to be valuable to customers and
                    difficult for competitors to obtain or imitate. For example, Apple has distinctive resources in
                    smartphone technologies and in its powerful brand, together with distinctive capabilities in
                    design and in understanding consumer behaviour.
                       Gary Hamel and C.K. Prahalad argue that distinctive capabilities or competences typically
                    remain unique because they comprise a bundle of constituent skills and technologies rather
                    than a single, discrete skill or technology. They refer to this as core competences and the
                    emphasis is thus on the linked set of resources, capabilities, skills and activities.6 In the Apple
                    example above it is thus the combination of all the resources and capabilities that make them
                    distinctive, qualifying them as core competences in Hamel’s and Prahalad’s words. Section 4.3
                    that follows discusses in more depth the role played by distinctive resources and capabilities in
                    contributing to long-term, sustainable competitive advantage. Section 4.3.3 explores further
                    the importance of linkages.



4.3 Distinctive resources and capabilities as a basis of
    competitive advantage
                    As explained above, distinctive resources and capabilities are necessary for sustainable compet-
                    itive advantage and superior economic performance. In the public sector and not-for-profit
                    context the equivalent concern is how to sustain relative superior performance and set the

organisation apart from others that have a similar purpose. This section considers four key
criteria by which resources and capabilities can be assessed in terms of them providing a basis for
achieving such competitive advantage: Value, Rarity, Inimitability and Organisational support –
or VRIO.7 Figure 4.2 illustrates these four fundamental criteria and the questions they address.


4.3.1 V – value of resources and capabilities
Resources and capabilities are valuable when they create a product or a service that is of
value to customers and enables the organisation to respond to environmental opportun-
ities or threats. There are three components to consider here:

• Value to customers. It may seem an obvious point to make that resources and capabilities
  need to be of value to customers, but in practice it is often ignored or poorly understood.
  For example, managers may seek to build on resources and capabilities that they may see
  as valuable, but which do not meet customers’ critical success factors (see Section 3.4.3).
  Or they may see a distinctive capability as of value simply because it is unique, although
  it may not be valued by customers. Having resources and capabilities that are different
  from other organisations is not, of itself, a basis of competitive advantage. Or a resource
  and capability may historically have been of value to customers but may no longer be.
• Taking advantage of opportunities and neutralising threats. The most fundamental point
  is that to be valuable resources and capabilities need to address opportunities and threats
  that arise in an organisation’s environment. This points to an important complementarity
  with the external environment of an organisation (Chapter 2 and 3). An external oppor-
  tunity is addressed when a resource or capability increases the value for customers either
  through lowering the price or by increasing the attractiveness of a product or service. For
  example, IKEA has valuable resources in its cost-conscious culture and size and related
  capabilities that lower its costs compared to competitors and this addresses opportunities
  of low-priced designed furniture for customers that competitors do not attend to. Using
  a resource and capability that fails to exploit opportunities or neutralise threats risks not
  creating value and even decreasing revenues and increasing costs.
• Cost. The product or service needs to be provided at a cost that still allows the organisation
  to make the returns expected of it. The danger is that the cost of developing or acquiring
  the resources and/or capabilities to deliver what customers especially value is such that
  products or services are not profitable.

Managers should therefore consider carefully which of their organisation’s activities are
especially important in providing such value and which are of less value. Value chain analysis
and activity systems mapping explained in Sections 4.4.2 and 4.4.3 can be of help here.

         Inimitability: Are resources and capabilities difficult and costly for competitors
    I    to obtain and imitate?

         Organisational support: Is the organisation appropriately organised to exploit the
    O    resources and capabilities?

Chapter 4 Resources and capabilities analysis


                    4.3.2 R – rarity
                    Resources and capabilities that are valuable but common among competitors are unlikely to
                    be a source of competitive advantage. If competitors have the same or similar resources and
                    capabilities, they can respond quickly to the strategic initiative of a rival. This has happened
                    in competition between car manufacturers as they have sought to add more accessories and
                    gadgets to cars. As soon as it becomes evident that these are valued by customers, they are intro-
                    duced widely by competitors that typically have access to the same technology. Rare resources
                    and capabilities, on the other hand, are those possessed uniquely by one organisation or by
                    a few others. Here competitive advantage is longer-lasting. For example, a company can have
                    patented products or services that give it advantage. Some libraries have unique collections of
                    books unavailable elsewhere; a company can have a powerful brand; or retail stores can have
                    prime locations. In terms of capabilities, organisations can have unique skills or business processes
                    developed over time or make use of special relationships with customers or suppliers not widely
                    possessed by competitors. However, it can be dangerous to assume that rarity will simply endure.
                    It may therefore be necessary to consider other bases of sustainability in competitive advantage.

                    4.3.3 I – inimitability
                    It should be clear by now that the search for resources and capabilities that provide sustain-
                    able competitive advantage is not straightforward. Having resources and capabilities that are
                    valuable to customers and relatively rare is important, but this may not be enough. Sustainable
                    competitive advantage also involves identifying inimitable resources and capabilities – those
                    that competitors find difficult and costly to imitate or obtain or substitute. If an organisa-
                    tion has a competitive advantage because of its particular marketing and sales skills it can only
                    sustain this if competitors cannot imitate, obtain or substitute for them or if the costs to do so
                    would eliminate any gains made. Often the barriers to imitation lie deeply in the organisation
                    in linkages between activities, skills and people.
                        At the risk of over-generalisation, it is unusual for competitive advantage to be explain-
                    able by differences in the tangible resources of organisations, since over time these can
                    usually be acquired or imitated (key geographic locations, certain raw material resources
                    and intangible resources like brands, etc., can, however, be exceptions). Advantage is more
                    likely to be determined by the way in which resources are deployed and managed in terms
                    of an organisation’s activities; in other words, on the basis of capabilities.8 For example, as
                    indicated above, it is unlikely that an IT system will improve an organisation’s competitive
                    standing in itself, not least because competitors can probably buy something very similar
                    on the open market. On the other hand, the capabilities to manage, develop and deploy
                    such a system to the benefit of customers may be much more difficult and costly to imitate.
                    Compared to physical assets, capabilities tend to involve more intangible imitation barriers.
                    In particular, they often include linkages that integrate activities, skills, knowledge and
                    people both inside and outside the organisation in distinct and mutually compatible ways.
                    These linkages can make capabilities particularly difficult for competitors to imitate and there
                    are three primary reasons why this may be so. These are summarised in Figure 4.3 and are
                    now briefly reviewed.

                    Complexity
                    The resources and capabilities of an organisation can be difficult to imitate because they are
                    complex and involve interlinkages. This may be for two main reasons:

                    • Internal linkages. There may be linked activities and processes that, together, deliver customer
                      value. The discussion of activity systems in Section 4.4.3 below explains this in more detail
                      and shows how such linked sets of activities might be mapped so that they can be better

100
                    4.3 Distinctive resources and capabilities as a basis of competitive advantage


   understood. However, even if a competitor possessed such a map, it is unlikely that it would
   be able to replicate the sort of complexity it represents because of the numerous interactions
   between tightly knit activities and decisions.9 This is not only because of the complexity itself
   but because, very likely, it has developed on the basis of custom and practice built up over
   years and is specific to the organisation concerned. For example, companies like IKEA (see
   case at the end of the chapter) and Ryanair10 still enjoy competitive advantages despite the
   availability of countless case studies, articles and reports on their successes.
• External interconnectedness. Organisations can make it difficult for others to imitate
  or obtain their bases of competitive advantage by developing activities together with
  customers or partners such that they become dependent on them. Apple, for example,
  has many intricate linkages with various app developers, partners and music labels that
  others may find difficult to imitate.


Causal ambiguity11
Another reason why resources and capabilities might be difficult and costly to imitate is that
competitors find it difficult to discern the causes and effects underpinning an organisation’s
advantage. This is called causal ambiguity and it may exist in two different forms:12

• Characteristic ambiguity. Where the significance of the characteristic itself is difficult to discern
  or comprehend, perhaps because it is rooted in the organisation’s culture or based on tacit
  knowledge. For example, the know-how of the buyers in a successful fashion retailer may
  be evident in the sales achieved for the ranges they buy year after year. But this may involve
  subtleties like spotting new trends and picking up feedback from pioneering customers that
  may be very difficult for competitors to comprehend so they will find it difficult to imitate.
• Linkage ambiguity. Where competitors cannot discern which activities and processes are
  dependent on which others to form linkages that create distinctiveness. The expertise of
  the fashion buyers is unlikely to be lodged in one individual or even one function. It is likely
  that there will be multiple and complex links to a network of suppliers, fashion experts,
  style bloggers and designers to understand the market. Indeed, in some organisations the
  managers themselves admit that they do not fully comprehend the linkages throughout the

                       organisation that deliver customer value. If this is so it would certainly be difficult for compet-
                       itors to understand them.


                    Culture and history
                    Resources and capabilities that involve complex social interactions and interpersonal relations
                    within an organisation can be difficult and costly for competitors to imitate. For example,
                    capabilities can become embedded in an organisation’s culture. Coordination between various
                    activities occurs ŉaturally’ because people know their part in the wider picture or it is simply
                    ‘taken for granted’ that activities are done in particular ways. We see this in high-performing
                    sports teams and in groups of people that work together to combine specialist skills as in
                    hospital operating theatres. Linked to this cultural embeddedness is the likelihood that such
                    capabilities have developed over time and in a particular way. The origins and history by which
                    capabilities and resources have developed over time are referred to as path dependency.13 This
                    history is specific to the organisation and cannot be imitated (see Section 6.2.1).
                        Tacit organisational knowledge is often part of inimitability as discussed above. It is personal,
                    context-specific knowledge and therefore hard to formalise and communicate. For example,
                    it could be the knowledge of a highly experienced sales force or research and development
                    team; or the experience of a top management team in making many successful acquisitions.
                    It is therefore not only distinctive to the organisation, but likely to be difficult to imitate or
                    obtain. In contrast, explicit knowledge is knowledge that can be articulated and transmitted
                    in formal systematic ways. It can take the form of a codified information resource such as a
                    systems manual or files of market research and intelligence.14 Many organisations that have
                    tried to improve the sharing of knowledge by relying on IT-based systems have come to realise
                    that, while some knowledge can usefully be codified and built into computer-based systems,
                    it can be very difficult to codify the knowledge that truly bestows competitive advantage.


                    4.3.4 O – organisational support
                    Providing value to customers and possessing capabilities that are rare and difficult to imitate
                    provide a potential for competitive advantage. However, the organisation must also be suit-
                    ably organised to support these capabilities including appropriate organisational processes
                    and systems. This implies that to fully take advantage of the resources and capabilities an
                    organisation’s structure and formal and informal management control systems need to
                    support and facilitate their exploitation (see Sections 14.1 and 14.2 for further discussions
                    of organisational structure and systems). The question of organisational support works as an
                    adjustment factor. Some of the potential competitive advantage can be lost if the organisa-
                    tion is not organised in a way that it can fully take advantage of valuable, rare and inimitable
                    resources and capabilities. For example, if an organisation has a unique patent underlying a
                    product that customers value it may still not be able to convert this into a competitive advan-
                    tage if it does not have the appropriate sales force to sell the product. Supporting capabilities
                    have been labelled complementary capabilities as, by themselves, they are often not enough
                    to provide for competitive advantage, but they are useful in the exploitation of other capabil-
                    ities that can provide for competitive advantage.15 In brief, even though an organisation has
                    valuable, rare and inimitable capabilities some of its potential competitive advantage may not
                    be realised if it lacks the organisational arrangements to fully exploit these.
                        In summary, and from a resource-based view of organisations, managers need to consider
                    whether their organisation has resources and capabilities to achieve and sustain competitive
                    advantage. To do so they need to consider how and to what extent it has capabilities which
                    are (i) valuable; (ii) rare; (iii) inimitable; and (iv) supported by the organisation. Illustration 4.2
                    gives an example of the tough challenges in meeting these criteria in the context of the
                    fastest-growing internet business ever, Groupon.

4.4 Analysing resources and capabilities
                    So far, this chapter has been concerned with explaining concepts associated with the stra-
                    tegic significance of organisations’ resources and capabilities. This section now provides
                    some ways in which they can be understood and diagnosed. It can be quite difficult to
                    discern where the basis of competitive advantage lies. Hence, if managers are to manage
                    the resources and capabilities of their organisation, the sort of analysis explained here,
                    the VRIO analysis tool, the value chain and system, activity systems, benchmarking, and
                    SWOT, are centrally important. If resources and capabilities are not understood at these
                    levels, there are dangers that managers can take the wrong course of action.


                    4.4.1 VRIO analysis
                    One lesson that emerges from an understanding of the strategic importance of resources and
                    capabilities is that it can be difficult to discern where the basis of competitive advantage lies.
                    The strict criteria of the VRIO framework discussed above (see Section 4.3) can conveniently
                    be used as a strategic tool to analyse whether an organisation has resources and capabilities
                    to achieve and sustain competitive advantage. A VRIO analysis thus helps to evaluate if,
                    how and to what extent an organisation or company has resources and capabilities that
                    are (i) valuable, (ii) rare, (iii) inimitable and (iv) supported by the organisation. Table 4.2
                    summarises the VRIO analysis of capabilities and shows that there is an additive effect.
                    Resources and capabilities provide sustainable bases of competitive advantage the more
                    they meet all four criteria. This analysis can be done for different functions in an organisation
                    (technology, manufacturing, purchasing, marketing and sales, etc.) or more fine-grained for
                    individual resources and capabilities (see Table 4.1). Another approach is to evaluate different
                    sections of the value chain or system with this tool (see Section 4.4.2 below).
                       Sometimes it may be challenging to establish the exact competitive implication, for
                    example when a resource or capability is on the border between sustained or temporary
                    competitive advantage (Illustration 4.2 demonstrates this). However, for managers it is
                    most important to distinguish between sustained or temporary competitive advantage vs.
                    competitive parity or competitive disadvantage (see Table 4.2). If it is difficult to discern
                    whether a function or resource or capability provides for sustained competitive advantage, it
                    may help to divide it into subparts. For example, manufacturing in itself may not provide for
                    competitive advantage, but perhaps product engineering or design do. And even if machines
                    and equipment generally do not provide for competitive advantage there may be a partic-
                    ular type of equipment that does.

4.4.2 The value chain and value system
The value chain describes the categories of activities within an organisation which,
together, create a product or service. Most organisations are also part of a wider value
system, the set of inter-organisational links and relationships that are necessary to create
a product or service. Both are useful in understanding the strategic position of an organisa-
tion and where valuable resources and capabilities reside.

The value chain
If organisations are to achieve competitive advantage by delivering value to customers,
managers need to understand which activities their organisation undertakes that are espe-
cially important in creating that value and which are not. This can then be used to model the
value generation of an organisation. The important point is that the concept of the value
chain invites the strategist to think of an organisation in terms of sets of activities. There are
different frameworks for considering these categories: Figure 4.4 is a representation of a value
chain as developed by Michael Porter.16
   Primary activities are directly concerned with the creation or delivery of a product or
service. For example, for a manufacturing business:

• Inbound logistics are activities concerned with receiving, storing and distributing inputs
  to the product or service including materials handling, stock control, transport, etc.
• Operations transform these inputs into the final product or service: machining, packaging,
  assembly, testing, etc.
• Outbound logistics collect, store and distribute the product or service to customers; for
  example, warehousing, materials handling, distribution, etc.
• Marketing and sales provide the means whereby consumers or users are made aware
  of the product or service and are able to purchase it. This includes sales administration,
  advertising and selling.
• Service includes those activities that enhance or maintain the value of a product or service,
  such as installation, repair, training and spares.

                    Each of these groups of primary activities is linked to support activities which help to improve
                    the effectiveness or efficiency of primary activities:

                    • Procurement. Processes that occur in many parts of the organisation for acquiring
                      the various resource inputs to the primary activities. These can be vitally important in
                      achieving scale advantages. So, for example, many large consumer goods companies with
                      multiple businesses nonetheless procure advertising centrally.
                    • Technology development. All value activities have a ‘technology’, even if it is just
                      know-how. Technologies may be concerned directly with a product (e.g. R&D, product
                      design) or with processes (e.g. process development) or with a particular resource (e.g.
                      raw materials improvements).
                    • Human resource management. This transcends all primary activities and is concerned with
                      recruiting, managing, training, developing and rewarding people within the organisation.
                    • Infrastructure. The formal systems of planning, finance, quality control, information
                      management and the structure of an organisation.

                    The value chain can be used to understand the strategic position of an organisation and
                    analyse resources and capabilities in three ways:

                    • As a generic description of activities. Figure 4.4 might be appropriate as a general frame-
                      work here or a value chain more specific to an organisation can be developed. The
                      important thing is to ask: (i) which separate categories of activities best describe the oper-
                      ations of the organisation; and (ii) which of these are most significant in delivering the
                      strategy and achieving advantage over competitors? For example, the value chain can
                      help managers understand if there is a cluster of activities providing benefit to customers
                      located within particular areas of it. Perhaps a business is especially good at outbound
                      logistics linked to its marketing and sales operation and supported by its technology
                      development. It might be less good in terms of its operations and its inbound logistics.
                    • In analysing the competitive position of the organisation by using the VRIO analysis for
                      individual value chain activities and functions (see Section 4.4.1 above).
                    • To analyse the value and cost of activities of an organisation. This could involve the
                      following two steps:

                       • Identifying sets of value activities. Which activities add most value to the final product or
                         service (and in turn to the customer) and which do not? For example, it is likely that in a
                         branded pharmaceutical company research and development and marketing activities
                         will be crucially important. It can also be important to establish which sets of activities
                         are linked to or are dependent on others and which, in effect, are self-standing.
                       • Relative importance of activity costs internally. In which activities and how can costs be
                         reduced? Does the significance of costs align with the significance of activities? Can costs
                         be reduced in some areas without affecting the value created for customers? For example,
                         organisations that have undertaken such analyses often find that central services have
                         grown to the extent that they are a disproportionate cost and do not add value to other
                         sets of activities or to the customer. Can some activities be outsourced (see Section 8.5.2), for
                         example those that are relatively free-standing and do not add value significantly? Can cost
                         savings be made by increasing economies of scale or scope; for example, through central
                         procurement or consolidating currently fragmented activities (e.g. manufacturing units)?


                    The value system
                    A single organisation rarely undertakes in-house all of the value activities from design
                    through to the delivery of the final product or service to the final consumer. There is usually

specialisation of activities so, as Figure 4.5 shows, any one organisation is part of a wider
value system of different interacting organisations. There are questions that arise here that
build on an understanding of the value chain and value system:

• The ‘make or buy’ or outsourcing decision for a particular activity is critical: which activities
  most need to be part of the internal value chain because they are central to achieving
  competitive advantage? There may also be activities that do not generate competitive
  advantage in themselves, but which the organisation needs to control as they enable the
  exploitation of competitive advantage in other parts of the value chain, as indicated in
  Section 4.3.4. Illustration 4.3 shows this in relation to the Nepalese poultry industry. Value
  system analysis was used by the Valley Group as a way of identifying what they should
  focus on in securing a steady supply of chicken and developing a more profitable struc-
  ture. While their analysis resulted in integration along the value system it is increasingly
  common to outsource activities as a means of lowering costs (see Chapter 8.5). Just as
  costs can be analysed across the internal value chain, they can also be analysed across the
  value system. If activities are less costly when performed by others without any adverse
  effects, it may make more sense to leave these to others along the value system.
• What are the activities and cost/price structures of the value system? It’s essential to understand
  the entire value system and its relationship to an organisation’s value chain as changes in the
  environment may require outsourcing or integration of activities depending on changing
  cost/price structures. The more an organisation outsources, the more its ability to evaluate
  and influence the performance of other organisations in the value system may become a crit-
  ically important capability in itself and even a source of competitive advantage. For example,
  the quality of a cooker or a television when it reaches the final purchaser is influenced not
  only by the activities undertaken within the manufacturing company itself, but also by the
  quality of components from suppliers and the performance of the distributors.
• Where are the profit pools?17 Profit pools refer to the different levels of profit avail-
  able at different parts of the value system. Some parts of a value system can be inher-
  ently more profitable than others because of the differences in competitive intensity (see
  Section 3.3.1). For example, in the computer industry microprocessors and software have

  becomes whether it is possible to focus on the areas of greatest profit potential. Care has
  to be exercised here. It is one thing to identify such potential; it is another to be successful
  in it given the capabilities an organisation has. For example, engineering firms may recog-
  nise the greater profit potential in providing engineering consulting services in addition
  to or instead of manufacturing. Nonetheless many have found it difficult to develop such
  services successfully either because their staff do not have consultancy capabilities or
  because their clients do not recognise the firms as having them.
• Partnering. Who might be the best partners in the various parts of the value system? And what
  kinds of relationships are important to develop with each partner? For example, should they
  be regarded as suppliers or should they be regarded as alliance partners (see Section 11.4)?



4.4.3 Activity systems
The discussion so far highlights the fact that all organisations comprise sets of resources and
capabilities, but that these are likely to be configured differently across organisations. It is
this variable configuration that makes an organisation and its strategy more or less unique.
So for the strategist, understanding this matters a good deal.
    VRIO and value chain analysis can help with this, but so too can understanding the more
fine-grained activity systems of an organisation. As the discussion above in Section 4.3 has
made clear, the way in which resources are deployed through the organisation actually takes
form in the activities pursued by that organisation; so it is important to identify what these
activities are, why they are valuable to customers, how the various activities fit together and
how they are different from competitors.
    Some scholars,18 including Michael Porter, have written about the importance of mapping
activity systems and shown how this might be done. The starting point is to identify what
Porter refers to as ‘higher order strategic themes’. In effect, these are the ways in which the
organisation meets the critical success factors determining them in the industry. The next step
is to identify the clusters of activities that underpin each of these themes and how these do or
do not fit together. The result is a picture of the organisation represented in terms of activity
systems such as that shown in Figure 4.6. It shows an activity systems map for the Scandinavian
strategic communications consultancy, Geelmuyden.Kiese.19 The core higher-order theme at
the heart of its success is its knowledge, built over the years, of how effective communications
can influence ‘the power dynamics of decision-making processes’. However, as Figure 4.6 shows
this central theme is related to other higher-order strategic themes (rectangles) as listed below
(each of which is underpinned by clusters of supporting activities; see ovals in Figure 4.6):

• Working at a strategic level based on its own in-house methodology, prioritising those
  clients where such work is especially valued.
• A clear stance on integrity of communication and always advises openness of communi-
  cation rather than suppression of information and only deals with clients that will accept
  such principles.
• Staff are given high degrees of freedom but with some absolute criteria of responsibility
  including strict rules for handling clients’ confidential information and strict sanctions if
  such rules are broken.
• Recruitment is based on ensuring this responsibility and largely on the basis of values of
  openness and integrity but also humour. The emphasis is on recruiting junior personnel
  and developing them based on a mentoring system and, thus, the company believes it
  offers the best learning opportunities in Scandinavia for young consultants.
• Strong financial incentives for top performance including rewards for the development of
  junior personnel and based on the internal evaluation of leadership qualities and performance.

                          When mapping activity systems four points need to be emphasised:

                          • Relationship to the value chain. The various activities represented in an activity map can also
                            be seen as parts of a value chain. The in-house methodology is, in effect, part of Geelmuyden.
                            Kiese’s operations; its recruitment practices are a component of its human resource manage-
                            ment; its stance on integrity and insistence on openness rather than suppression of the infor-
                            mation part of its service offering; and so on. However, activity systems mapping encourages
                            a greater understanding of the complexity of resources and capabilities – important if bases
                            of competitive advantage are to be identified and managed.
                          • The importance of linkages and fit. An activity systems map emphasises the importance
                            of different activities that create value to customers pulling in the same direction and
                            supporting rather than opposing each other. So the need is to understand (i) the fit
                            between the various activities and how these reinforce each other and (ii) the fit exter-
                            nally with the needs of clients. There are two implications:
                            • The danger of piecemeal change or tinkering with such systems which may damage
                              the positive benefits of the linkages that exist (see Chapter 15).
                            • The consequent challenge of managing change. When change is needed the implica-
                              tion is that change to one part of the system will almost inevitably affect another; or,
                              put another way, change probably has to be managed to the whole system.

• Relationship to VRIO. It is these linkages and this fit that can be the bases of sustainable
  competitive advantage. In combination they may be valuable to clients, truly distinctive
  and therefore rare. Moreover, while individual components of an activity system might
  be relatively easy to imitate, in combination they may well constitute the complexity and
  causal ambiguity rooted in culture and history that makes them inimitable. Finally, there
  can be activities in the system that in themselves do not provide for competitive advan-
  tage, but that provide organisational support for other activities that do.
• Superfluous activities. It should also be asked if there are activities that are not required
  in order to pursue a particular strategy or if some activities do not contribute to value
  creation. If activities do not do this, why are they being pursued by the organisation?
  Whether Ryanair used activity mapping or not, it has systematically identified and
  done away with many activities that other airlines commonly have (adjustable seats,
  pre-boarding assigned seats, in-flight drinks and meals, etc.).


4.4.4 Benchmarking
Benchmarking is used as a means of understanding how an organisation compares with
others.20 It may be organisations that compete in the same industry or sectors, typically
competitors, or other organisations that perform the same or similar functions. Many bench-
marking exercises focus on outputs such as standards of product or service, but others do
attempt to take account of organisational capabilities.
   Broadly, there are two approaches to benchmarking:

• Industry/sector benchmarking. Insights about performance standards can be gleaned by
  comparing performance against other organisations in the same industry sector or between
  similar service providers against a set of performance indicators. Some public-sector organ-
  isations have, in effect, acknowledged the existence of strategic groups (see Section 3.4.1)
  by benchmarking against similar organisations rather than against everybody: for example,
  local government services and police treat ‘urban’ differently from ‘rural’ in their bench-
  marking and league tables. However, an overriding danger of industry norm comparisons
  (whether in the private or the public sector) is that the whole industry can be performing
  badly and losing out competitively to other industries that can satisfy customers’ needs in
  different ways.
• Best-in-class benchmarking. Best-in-class benchmarking compares an organisation’s
  performance or capabilities against ‘best-in-class’ performance – from whichever industry –
  and therefore seeks to overcome some of the above limitations. It may also help challenge
  managers’ mindsets that acceptable improvements in performance will result from incre-
  mental changes in resources or capabilities. For example, Southwest Airlines improved
  refuelling time by studying the processes surrounding Formula One Grand Prix motor
  racing pit stops.21

The importance of benchmarking is, then, not so much in the detailed ‘mechanics’ of
comparison but in the impact that these comparisons might have on reviewing resources
and capabilities underlying performance. But benchmarking has two potential limitations:

• Surface comparisons. If benchmarking is limited to comparing outputs, it does not directly
  identify the reasons for relative performance in terms of underlying resources and
  capabilities. For example, it may demonstrate that one organisation is poorer at customer
  service than another, but not show the underlying reasons. The benchmarking exercise
  should therefore be treated as the start of a deeper investigation into the explanation of
  differences.



                                                                                           111
Chapter 4 Resources and capabilities analysis


                    • Simply achieving competitive parity. Benchmarking can help an organisation to
                      develop capabilities and create value in the same way as its competitors and those
                      best-in-class. However, the best performance that can be expected out of this exercise
                      is to achieve a threshold level and competitive parity. For organisations with competi-
                      tive disadvantage this can be highly rewarding, but to achieve competitive advantage
                      an organisation needs to move further and develop its own distinctive resources and
                      capabilities.



                    4.4.5 SWOT22
                    It can be helpful to summarise the key issues arising from an analysis of resources and
                    capabilities discussed in this chapter and the analysis of the business environment discussed
                    in Chapter 3 to gain an overall picture of an organisation’s strategic position. SWOT provides
                    a general summary of the Strengths and Weaknesses explored in an analysis of resources
                    and capabilities (Chapter 4) and the Opportunities and Threats explored in an analysis of
                    the environment (Chapters 2 and 3). This analysis can also be useful as a basis for generating
                    strategic options and assessing future courses of action.
                        The aim is to identify the extent to which strengths and weaknesses are relevant to, or
                    capable of dealing with, the changes taking place in the business environment. Illustration 4.4
                    takes the example of a pharmaceuticals firm (Pharmcare).23 It assumes that key environ-
                    mental impacts have been identified from analyses explained in Chapters 2 and 3 and that
                    major strengths and weaknesses have been identified using the analytic tools explained in
                    this chapter. A scoring mechanism (plus 5 to minus 5) is used as a means of getting managers
                    to assess the interrelationship between the environmental impacts and the strengths and
                    weaknesses of the firm. A positive (+) denotes that the strength of the company would help
                    it take advantage of, or counteract, a problem arising from an environmental change or that
                    a weakness would be offset by that change. A negative (−) score denotes that the strength
                    would be reduced or that a weakness would prevent the organisation from overcoming
                    problems associated with that change.
                        Pharmcare’s share price has been declining because investors were concerned that its
                    strong market position was under threat. This had not been improved by a merger that was
                    proving problematic. The pharmaceutical market was changing with new ways of doing busi-
                    ness, driven by new technology, the quest to provide medicines at lower cost and politicians
                    seeking ways to cope with soaring healthcare costs and an ever more informed patient. But
                    was Pharmcare keeping pace? The strategic review of the firm’s position (Illustration 4.4a)
                    confirmed its strengths of a flexible sales force, well-known brand name and new healthcare
                    department. However, there were major weaknesses, namely relative failure on low-cost
                    drugs, competence in information and communication technology (ICT) and a failure to get
                    to grips with increasingly well-informed users.
                        However, in the context of this chapter, if this analysis is to be useful, it must be remem-
                    bered that the exercise is not absolute but relative to its competitors. So SWOT analysis is
                    most useful when it is comparative – if it examines strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and
                    threats in relation to competitors. When the impact of environmental forces on competitors
                    was analysed (Illustration 4.4b), it showed that Pharmcare was still outperforming its trad-
                    itional competitor (Company W), but potentially vulnerable to changing dynamics in the
                    general industry structure courtesy of niche players (X and Y).

                      There are two main dangers in a SWOT exercise:

                   • Listing. A SWOT exercise can generate very long lists of apparent strengths, weak-
                     nesses, opportunities and threats, whereas what matters is to be clear about what is
                     really important and what is less important. So prioritisation of issues matters. Three
                     brief rules can be helpful here. First, as indicated above, focus on strengths and weak-
                     nesses that differ in relative terms compared to competitors or comparable organisa-
                     tions and leave out areas where the organisation is at par with others. Second, focus
                     on opportunities and threats that are directly relevant for the specific organisation
                     and industry and leave out general and broad factors. Third, summarise the results
                     and draw concrete conclusions based on the analysis (the TOWS matrix below can be
                     of help here).
                   • A summary, not a substitute. SWOT analysis is an engaging and fairly simple tool. It is also
                     useful in summarising and consolidating other analysis that has been explained in Chap-
                     ters 2, 3 and 4. It is not, however, a substitute for that analysis. There are two dangers if it
                     is used on its own. The first is that, in the absence of more thorough analysis, managers
                     rely on preconceived, often inherited and biased views. The second is again the danger
                     of a lack of specificity. Identifying very general strengths, for example, does not explain
                     the underlying reasons for those strengths.

                       SWOT can also help focus discussion on future choices and the extent to which an organ-
                   isation is capable of supporting these strategies. A useful way of doing this is to use a TOWS
                   matrix,24 as shown in Figure 4.7. This builds directly on the information in a SWOT exercise.
                   Each box of the TOWS matrix can be used to identify options that address a different combin-
                   ation of the internal factors (strengths and weaknesses) and the external factors (opportun-
                   ities and threats). For example, the top left-hand box prompts a consideration of options
                   that use the strengths of the organisation to take advantage of opportunities in the business
                   environment. An example for Pharmcare might be the re-training of the sales force to deal
                   with changes in pharmaceuticals buying. The bottom right-hand box prompts options that
                   minimise weaknesses and also avoid threats; for Pharmcare this might include the need to

4.5 Dynamic capabilities
                    The previous section was concerned with analysing resources and capabilities. This section
                    considers what managers can do to manage and improve resources and capabilities. If
                    resources and capabilities for competitive advantage do not exist, then managers need to
                    consider if they can be developed. Also, if they are to provide a basis for long-term success,
                    resources and capabilities cannot be static; they need to change. University of Berkeley
                    economist David Teece has introduced the concept of dynamic capabilities, by which he
                    means an organisation’s ability to renew and recreate its resources and capabilities to
                    meet the needs of changing environments.25 He argues that the resources and capabilities
                    that are necessary for efficient operations, like owning certain tangible assets, controlling
                    costs, maintaining quality, optimising inventories, etc., are unlikely to be sufficient for
                    sustaining superior performance long term.26 These ‘ordinary capabilities’ allow companies
                    to be successful and earn a living now by producing and selling a similar product or service
                    to similar customers, but are not likely to provide for long-term survival and competitive
                    advantage in the future.27
                       In other words, there is a danger that capabilities and resources that were the basis
                    of competitive success can over time be imitated by competitors, become common prac-
                    tice in an industry or become redundant as its environment changes. So, the important
                    lesson is that if resources and capabilities are to be effective over time they need to
                    change; they cannot be static. Dynamic capabilities are directed towards that strategic
                    change. They are dynamic in the sense that they can create, extend or modify an organ-
                    isation’s existing ordinary capabilities. New product development is a typical example
                    of a dynamic capability and strategic analysis is another. Outlet expansion by chain
                    retailers such as Starbucks or Zara is yet another example as it extends ordinary capabil-
                    ities. Dynamic capabilities may also take the form of relatively formal organisational
                    systems, such as reorganisation, recruitment and management development processes
                    and cooperating with others through alliances or acquisitions, by which new skills are
                    learned and developed.28 Illustration 4.5 provides an example of dynamic capabilities in
                    the context of mobile and smartphones, but also shows that they are not necessarily a
                    guarantee for future success.
                       In brief, dynamic capabilities can change ordinary capabilities in case the environment
                    changes. However, as they are focused on finding solutions beyond and outside current
                    ordinary capabilities there is a trade-off and tension between the two that can make it diffi-
                    cult to achieve an optimal balance between them. It is sometimes referred to as exploration/
                    exploitation trade-offs and they are further discussed in Chapter 15.
                       Teece suggests the following three generic types of dynamic capabilities:

                    • Sensing. Sensing implies that organisations must constantly scan, search and explore
                      opportunities across various markets and technologies. Research and development and
                      investigating customer needs are typical sensing activities. For example, companies in the
                      PC operating systems industry, like Microsoft, sensed the threats from and opportunities
                      in tablets and cloud computing services and applications.

                                                                         4.5 Dynamic capabilities


• Seizing. Once an opportunity is sensed it must be seized and addressed through new
  products or services, processes, activities etc. Microsoft, for example, seized opportunities
  by launching their own tablet devices and cloud computing services.
• Reconfiguring. To seize an opportunity may require renewal and reconfiguration of organ-
  isational capabilities and investments in new technologies, manufacturing, markets, etc.
  For example, Microsoft’s inroad into tablets and cloud computing and related software
  and apps required major changes in its existing PC and game console resources and
  capabilities. The company needed to discard some of its old capabilities, acquire and build
  new ones and recombine them.

This view of dynamic capabilities relates directly to the framework for this book: strategic
position, strategic choices and strategy in action (see Figure 1.3). Sensing capabilities are to
do with understanding an organisation’s strategic position; seizing opportunities relate to
making strategic choices; and reconfiguration is to do with enacting strategies.
   As Teece acknowledges, dynamic capabilities are likely to have ‘micro-foundations’ 29
in people’s behaviour within organisations, such as the way in which decisions get taken,
personal relationships, and entrepreneurial and intuitive skills. This puts the focus on
behaviour and the significance of beliefs, social relationships and organisational processes
in capability management, which is discussed in ‘Thinking Differently’ at the end of this
chapter.30
   As suggested, above dynamic capabilities may take different forms and there are thus
many ways in which managers might create, extend or upgrade resources and capabilities
including more experimental ones. Several approaches to manage resources and capabilities
are discussed in other parts of this book:31

• Internal capability development. Could resources and capabilities be added or upgraded
  so that they become more reinforcing of outcomes that deliver against critical success
  factors? This might be done, for example, by:
  • Building and recombining capabilities. Creating entirely new capabilities that provide
    for competitive advantage requires entrepreneurship and intrapreneurship skills.
    Managers can build managerial systems and a culture that promote capability innova-
    tion or form new venture units outside the rules of ordinary R&D and product devel-
    opment (see Chapter 10).32
  • Leveraging capabilities. Managers might identify resources and capabilities in one area
    of their organisation, perhaps customer service in one geographic business unit of a
    multinational, which are not present in other business units. They might then seek
    to extend this throughout all the business units, but capabilities might not be easily
    transferred because of the problems of managing change (see Chapter 15).
  • Stretching capabilities. Managers may see the opportunity to build new products or
    services out of existing capabilities. Indeed, building new businesses in this way is the
    basis of related diversification, as explained in Chapter 8.

• External capability development. Similarly, there may be ways of developing resources and
  capabilities by looking externally. For example, they could be attained or developed by
  acquisition or entering into alliances and joint ventures (see Chapter 11).
• Ceasing activities. Could current activities, not central to the delivery of value to customers,
  be done away with, outsourced or reduced in cost? If managers are aware of the resources
  and capabilities central to bases of competitive advantage, they can retain these and focus
  on areas of cost reduction that are less significant (see Chapter 7).

                          capabilities, but to achieve sustained competitive advantage it also needs to be unique
                          and distinctive.
                        • To be distinctive and provide for sustainable competitive advantage resources and capabil-
                          ities need to fulfil the VRIO criteria of being Valuable, Rare, Inimitable and supported by
                          the Organisation.
                        • Ways of diagnosing organisational resources and capabilities include:
                           • VRIO analysis of resources and capabilities as a tool to evaluate if they contribute to
                             competitive advantage.
                           • Analysing an organisation’s value chain and value system as a basis for understanding
                             how value to a customer is created and can be developed.
                           • Activity systems mapping as a means of identifying more detailed activities which
                             underpin resources and capabilities.
                           • Benchmarking as a means of understanding the relative performance of organisations.
                           • SWOT analysis as a way of drawing together an understanding of the strengths, weak-
                             nesses, opportunities and threats an organisation faces.
                        • Managers need to adapt and change resources and capabilities if the environment changes
                          and/or competitors catch up and this can be done based on dynamic capabilities: sensing,
                          seizing and reconfiguring new or modified resources and capabilities.

                        4.1   Using Table 4.1 identify the resources and capabilities of an organisation with which
                              you are familiar; your university or school, for example. Alternatively, you can answer
                              this in relation to, H&M* or Formula One* if you wish.
                        4.2   Undertake a VRIO analysis of the resources and capabilities of an organisation with
                              which you are familiar in order to identify which resources and capabilities meet the
                              criteria of: (a) value, (b) rarity, (c) inimitability and (d) organisational support (see
                              Section 4.3; Figure 4.2 and Table 4.2). You can answer this in relation to H&M* or
                              Formula One* or the end of chapter case, Rocket Internet, if you so wish.
                        4.3   Undertake a value chain or system analysis for an organisation of your choice (refer-
                              ring to Illustration 4.3 could be helpful). You can answer this in relation to a case
                              study in the book such as Ryanair* or the end case, Rocket Internet, if you wish.
                        4.4   For a benchmarking exercise to which you have access, make a critical assessment of
                              the benefits and dangers of the approach that was taken.
                        4.5   For an industry or public service of your choice consider how the resources and
                              capabilities that have been the basis of competitive advantage (or best value in the
                              public sector) have changed over time. Why have these changes occurred? How did
                              the relative strengths of different companies or service providers change over this
                              period? Why? Did dynamic capabilities play any role? Which?

                              3. What are the conclusions you arrive at from your analysis and how would these
                              inform an evaluation of strategy (see Chapter 12)?

5.1 Introduction
          Facebook’s scandals during 2018 raised major questions regarding the company’s social
          responsibilities, its corporate governance, and even its basic strategy. Facebook’s strategy
          relies heavily on harvesting private data from its users for selling on to diverse advertisers.
          But these data are liable to leakage or abuse. In 2018 it was revealed that Cambridge
          Analytica, a political consulting company, had used Facebook data from 87 million users to
          secretly influence both the 2016 American Presidential election and the 2016 Brexit refer-
          endum in the United Kingdom. Later in 2018, Facebook admitted to a data breach involving
          50 million users. Over the year, Facebook’s stock price trailed the financial markets by about
          a fifth. Politicians and regulators increasingly challenged Facebook’s data policies. Many
          doubted whether the 34-year-old company founder and chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg,
          was fit to govern a company with two billion users, 30,000 employees and a market value
          of around $600bn. Zuckerberg’s shares have enhanced voting rights, so he controls nearly
          70 per cent of shareholder votes even while holding only 18 per cent of the shares.
              Facebook’s troubles highlight the problem of balancing the interests of diverse stake-
          holders – in Facebook’s case, advertisers interested in sales, shareholders concerned for
          profits, users needing privacy and society anxious about the abuse of power. They also under-
          line the importance of corporate governance, with Facebook led by a young founder who
          dominates despite having only a minority ownership stake. In question too are the ethics of
          a strategy that relies on selling the data of poorly informed users. These three issues are all
          strategic: strategies to maximise advertisers’ interests might be at the cost of users’ privacy;
          a domineering founder may choose bolder strategies than would professional managers; a
          strategic commitment to high ethical standards might constrain both advertisers and users.
              It is these stakeholder, governance and ethical issues that this chapter deals with. First,
          it introduces the importance of different organisational stakeholders – including owners,
          employees, customers, suppliers, communities and society. Next it addresses the role of
          formal governance mechanisms – in Facebook’s case, concentrating power in the hands of
          a single founder. Finally, the chapter concludes with a discussion of corporate social respon-
          sibility, significant for all organisations but especially for social media companies where user
          data is a saleable product.
              The three issues of stakeholders, governance and ethics recall Chapter 1’s discussion of
          purpose, as reflected in organisational missions, visions, values and objectives. The wishes of key
          stakeholders should define the purpose of an organisation; formal governance mechanisms
          and ethical considerations should then guide the translation of that purpose into strategy.
          Figure 5.1 depicts the flow: strategy originates from stakeholders, whose wishes are processed
          through governance and social responsibility screens before finally being put into action.
              The chapter continues therefore as follows:

          • Section 5.2 introduces the various types of stakeholder who may be involved in strategy,
            and shows how to map their power and attention using stakeholder analysis. The section
            then focuses on one crucial set of stakeholders, that is owners (shareholders), and their
            roles under different ownership models.
          • Section 5.3 addresses the formal corporate governance mechanisms within which organ-
            isations operate. Governance is concerned with the way in which legally constituted
            bodies such as boards of directors influence strategy through formalised processes for
            supervising executive decisions and actions.

          • Section 5.4 is concerned with issues of corporate social responsibility. How should
            managers respond strategically to the expectations society has of their organisations,
            particularly with regard to environmental, social and governance issues?

                                                                                                         129

5.2 Stakeholders1
                   Strategic decisions are influenced by the expectations of stakeholders. Stakeholders are
                   those who have some kind of stake in the future of the business. More formally, stakeholders
                   are those individuals or groups that depend on an organisation to fulfil their own goals
                   and on whom, in turn, the organisation depends. These stakeholders can be very diverse,
                   including owners, customers, suppliers, employees and local communities. Facebook’s stake-
                   holders include the shareholders who have invested their wealth in its future, the advertisers
                   who depend on it to access their markets, the employees who are building careers in the
                   company and the users who rely on it for their social lives. To the extent their organisations
                   depend on them, managers must take all stakeholders into account. However, stakeholder
                   demands can diverge widely, especially in the short term: for instance, in many companies
                   profit maximisation on the part of shareholders may come at the expense of customers who
                   want quality products, employees who want good jobs and groups in the wider society who
                   want a clean environment. It is important therefore that managers understand who their
                   stakeholders are, what they want and which have most influence upon their strategies. This
                   section describes stakeholders in general, then introduces the power/attention matrix for
                   assessing their influence and finally focuses on owners, typically one of the most important
                   stakeholders.


                   5.2.1 Stakeholder groups
                   External stakeholders can be usefully divided into five (potentially overlapping) types,
                   categorised according to the nature of their relationship with the organisation and how
                   they might affect strategic direction (see Figure 5.2):

                   • Economic stakeholders, including suppliers, customers, distributors, banks and owners
                     (shareholders).
                   • Social/political stakeholders, such as policy-makers, local councils, regulators and govern-
                     ment agencies that may influence the strategy directly or via the context in which strategy
                     is developed.

• Technological stakeholders, such as key adopters, standards agencies and ecosystem
  members supplying complementary products or services (e.g. applications for particular
  mobile phones).
• Community and society stakeholders, who are affected by what an organisation does: for
  example, those who live close to a factory or, indeed, groups in the wider society. These
  stakeholders typically lack the formal powers of social/political stakeholders such as local
  councils, but may form activist groups to influence the organisation.
• Internal stakeholders, who may be specialised departments, local offices and factories or
  employees at different levels in the hierarchy.

Individuals may belong to more than one stakeholder group and such groups may ‘line up’
differently depending on the issue or strategy in hand. The influence of different types of
stakeholders is likely to vary in different situations. For example, technological stakeholders
will be crucial for strategies of new product development, while the social/political stake-
holders are usually particularly influential in the public-sector context or for multinational
companies operating in countries with demanding political and legal systems.
   Since the expectations of stakeholder groups will differ, it is normal for conflict to exist
regarding the importance or desirability of aspects of strategy. In most situations, a compro-
mise will need to be reached. Table 5.1 shows some typical situations which give rise to
conflicting stakeholder expectations.

Table 5.1 Some common conflicts of stakeholder interests and expectations

 • Pursuit of short-term profits may suit shareholders and managerial bonuses but come at the
   expense of investment in long-term competitive advantage.

 • Family business owners may want business growth, but also fear the loss of family control if they
   need to appoint professional managers to cope with larger-scale operations.

 • Low-cost strategies may benefit shareholders but adversely affect employee or environmental
   stakeholders.

 • In public services, excellence in specialised services might divert resources from standard services
   used by the majority (e.g. heart transplants come at the cost of preventative dentistry).

 • In large multinational organisations, conflict can result because of a local division's responsibil-
   ities simultaneously to the company head office and to its host country.



   The stakeholder concept, and its sensitivity to different wants, helps to understand the
organisational politics of strategic decision-making. Taking stakeholder expectations and
influence into account is an important aspect of strategic choice, as will be seen in Chapter 12.
Stakeholder mapping also helps in managing the organisational politics of strategy.


5.2.2 Stakeholder mapping2
Given that there are often so many stakeholders, it is useful to categorise them according to
their likely influence on strategic decisions. Stakeholder mapping identifies stakeholder
power and attention in order to understand strategic priorities. The underlying view is
that organisations involve political coalitions of stakeholders, each of which has different
kinds of power and each of which pays different amounts of attention to strategic issues.3
Building coalitions of supportive stakeholders is therefore crucial to strategy.
   It is therefore important to understand the power different stakeholders have and their
likely attention to issues. These two dimensions form the basis of the power/attention matrix
shown as Figure 5.3. The matrix classifies stakeholders in relation to the power they hold and

                      the extent to which they are likely to attend actively to a particular strategic issue. The matrix
                      allows different stakeholders to be plotted either according to the simple dichotomy of low
                      or high, or more subtly according to their relative positions along continuous axes from low
                      to high. The positions of different stakeholders on the matrix are likely to vary according to
                      each issue: stakeholders may have more power in some domains than others, and will care
                      more about some issues than others. Power and attention can be assessed as follows.

                      Power4
                      In designing strategy, it is important to understand which stakeholders are most powerful. For
                      the purposes of this discussion, power is the ability of individuals or groups to persuade,
                      induce or coerce others into following particular strategies. As Table 5.2 shows, there are
                      different sources of power. Power not only derives from people’s hierarchical position within
                      an organisation or from formal corporate governance arrangements. It could be a function
                      of the resources or know-how they control or the networks they have built up: see Table 5.2.
                      For example, the walk-outs by Google engineers during 2018 were effective in changing the
                      company’s approach to sexual harassment because the company depended so much on their
                      expertise and support.
                         The wide range of power sources underlines the importance of recognising different indi-
                      cators of power. The powerful are not just those sitting at the top of the formal hierarchy:
                      some people may be influential because of their informal status within the organisation,
                      for instance as significant innovators in the past or as trusted advisers to top management.5

                      Attention
                      Attention matters as well as power.6 Stakeholders vary in the attention they pay to the
                      organisation and particular issues within it. Even powerful stakeholders may not attend
                      closely to everything. For example, many companies have institutional shareholders (e.g.
                      pension funds) as major shareholders, but because these shareholders hold shares in many
                      different companies, they may not care greatly about the detailed strategy of any single
                      company.
                         In assessing the attention that stakeholders are likely to pay, three factors are particularly
                      important:

                      • Criticality: stakeholders will pay more attention to issues that are critical for them. For example,
                        shareholders might not see health and safety at work as critical, but employees very likely will.
                      • Channels: stakeholders will pay more attention where there are good channels of infor-
                        mation and communication. For example, it is increasingly common nowadays for chief

  executives to invite their shareholders to ‘strategy days’ or ‘strategy reviews’, providing
  a channel thereby for a detailed discussion of strategy that might not otherwise be
  possible.7 Where channels are poor, stakeholders may be unable to pay sufficient atten-
  tion even to issues they regard as critical: for example, many ethical investors (such as
  Church and political groups) care passionately about employment conditions for overseas
  workers, but lack the channels effectively to find out about them.
• Cognitive capacity: sometimes stakeholders simply do not have the cognitive capacity to
  process all the information they have. Channels can even be so good that they overwhelm
  organisations’ ability to attend to the flood of information that flows through them. Thus
  institutional investors may have access to a host of information about the strategies of all
  the various companies they invest in, but be obliged to reduce complexity by focusing on
  simple measures such as forecast financial earnings, rather than the details of company
  strategy.

   The power/attention matrix indicates the type of relationship that managers might typic-
ally establish with stakeholders in the different quadrants. Generally, relationships are more
intense as they progress from quadrant D up to quadrant A. Thus cultivating the support
of key players (quadrant A) is of greatest importance: these might be major investors, for
example. However, it is also important to satisfy the sleeping giants in quadrant B: these
might be government regulators. Although sleeping giants might generally be relatively
passive, difficulties can arise when dissatisfaction awakens their attention and they reposition
to segment A: here they may challenge the strategy. The gadflies in quadrant C, for example
community campaign groups, can usually be managed largely by information provision.
Although not powerful themselves, it is important not to alienate such stakeholders because
they can influence more powerful stakeholders: for example, community campaigners might
awaken the giants in quadrant B.
   The power/attention matrix is a useful tool for analysing potential coalitions of stake-
holders for or against particular decisions. Aligning potential supporters for strategic initia-
tives, and appeasing opponents, are often crucial moves in the process of strategic change
(see Chapter 15). Building stakeholder coalitions is at the core of strategy, therefore. Stake-
holder mapping can help in three aspects of the coalition-building process:

• Analysing who the key blockers and facilitators of a strategy are likely to be.
• Repositioning certain stakeholders, for instance diverting the attention of powerful
  potential blockers so that they transition to quadrant B, while mobilising the attention of
  powerful potential facilitators so that they move to quadrant A. For example, a regulator
  might be made alert to the dangers of an aggressive competitor seeking to abuse its
  market power.
• Maintaining the appropriate level of attention or power of some stakeholders: this is what
  is meant by keep satisfied in relation to stakeholders in quadrant B, and to a lesser extent
  keep informed for those in quadrant C.


5.2.3 Owners
Owners are typically key stakeholders in strategic decisions. However, their power and atten-
tion can vary according to different ownership models.
   There are many different ways firms are owned, and the boundaries between them often
blur.8 However, it is useful to distinguish four main ownership models, each with different
implications for strategy. Figure 5.4 ranges these four models along two axes. The horizontal
axis describes the dominant modes of management, ranging from wholly professional (with
managers employed for their professional expertise) to wholly personal (with managers

                   employed because of their personal relationships with owners). The vertical axis describes
                   the extent to which organisational purpose (Chapter 1) is focused on profit as an exclusive
                   goal or on profit as just one of a mix of motives. In each case, there is a range along the axes:
                   organisations vary in their relative positioning. Also some organisations do not conform to
                   the typical behaviour of their ownership model: these are organisational hybrids, for instance
                   pursuing profit and social goals simultaneously.9 Nonetheless organisations with particular
                   ownership models do tend to behave in distinctive ways.
                      The four main ownership models are as follows:

                   • Publicly-quoted companies (often called publicly traded companies or public limited
                     companies) are the most important ownership model in economies such as the USA,
                     Europe, Japan and many others. These companies’ shares are ‘quoted’ on public stock
                     exchanges. In other words, their shares can be bought and sold by the public, either in
                     the form of individual investors or, frequently, institutions such as pension funds, banks
                     or insurance companies.10 Usually owners do not manage publicly-quoted companies
                     themselves, but delegate that function to professional managers. In this sense, owners
                     of publicly-quoted companies sacrifice some power, and reduce their attention. However,
                     in principle, company managers work to make a financial return for their owners – that
                     is why the public usually buy the shares in the first place. In terms of Figure 5.4 therefore,
                     most publicly-quoted companies focus strongly on profit. However, profit maximisation
                     is rarely a simple goal for companies. There is often a delicate balance to be struck: short-
                     term profits might be improved by cutting research budgets or taking advantage of loyal
                     customers, but such action may well be at the expense of long run profitability. In relation
                     to the vertical axis in Figure 5.4, publicly-quoted companies may therefore vary in how
                     much they focus on profit objectives.
                   • State-owned enterprises are wholly or majority owned by national or sometimes regional
                     governments. They are very important in many economies: about 80 per cent of stock
                     market value is accounted for by state-owned companies in China, 60 per cent in Russia

136
                                                                                 5.2 Stakeholders


  and 40 per cent in Brazil.11 Privatisation has reduced the role of state-owned enterprises
  in many economies, but quasi-privatised agencies (such as hospital trusts and school acad-
  emies in the United Kingdom) operate in a similar way. In state-owned enterprises, poli-
  ticians typically delegate day-to-day control to professional managers, though they may
  attend more closely to major strategic issues. State-owned enterprises usually have to earn
  some kind of profit or surplus in order to fund investment and build financial reserves,
  but they are also likely to pursue a range of other objectives that are in keeping with
  government policy. For Chinese state-owned enterprises, for example, securing access
  to overseas resources such as minerals and energy is an important objective, worthwhile
  sacrificing some profits for.
• Entrepreneurial businesses are businesses that are substantially owned and controlled
  by their founders. Founders are typically very powerful, because of their ownership, the
  respect they are held in and their deep knowledge of their businesses. Founders head
  some major companies. For example, Lakshmi Mittal remains chairman and chief execu-
  tive of his creation, Arcelor Mittal, the largest steel company in the world. Nonetheless,
  as they grow, entrepreneurial businesses are likely both to rely more on professional
  managers and to draw in external investors in order to fund new opportunities. Typically
  entrepreneurial companies need to attend closely to profit in order to survive and grow.
  However, entrepreneurs may attend to some issues more than others.12 For example, Jeff
  Bezos as founder of Amazon for a long time has favoured growth strategies over short-
  term profitability.
• Family businesses are typically businesses where ownership by the founding entrepreneur
  has passed on to his or her family, on account of the founder’s death or retirement for
  instance. Most family businesses are small- to medium-sized enterprises, but they can
  be very big: Ford, Fiat, Samsung and Walmart, the largest retailer in the world, are all
  under family ownership and retain significant family involvement in top management
  roles. Quite often the family retains a majority of the voting shares, while releasing the
  remainder to the public on the stock market: thus half of stock market-listed companies in
  the 10 largest Asian markets are effectively family-controlled.13 However, family members
  may lack the skill and inclination to attend closely to strategy. Family businesses therefore
  often bring in professional managers, even while retaining ultimate family control: thus
  the Chief Executive of Ford is a non-family member, but the Executive Chairman is still
  William Ford Jr. For family businesses, retaining control over the company, passing on
  management to the next generation and ensuring the company’s long-term survival are
  often very important objectives, and these might rule out profit-maximising strategies
  that involve high risk or require external finance. Thus a family business might diversify
  into lots of small businesses rather than engage in one large one, because that would
  minimise risk and give a chance to younger family members to work in distinct areas of
  activity.14

As well as these four main types of ownership model, there are several other variants that
play smaller but still significant roles in the economy.15 Private equity funds buy firms in order
to supply capital and managerial expertise, with the aim of boosting performance and selling
the firms on for a profit after several years. Private equity-owned firms usually pursue strat-
egies likely to show improved financial performance within a limited time period. Not-for-
profit organisations, such as Oxfam (Illustration 5.1), are typically owned by a charitable
foundation: they may need to make some kind of surplus to fund investment and protect
against hard times, but they fundamentally exist to pursue social missions. The partnership
model, in which the organisation is owned and controlled by senior employees (its part-
ners), is important in many professional services such as law and accounting. There are also
employee-owned firms, which spread ownership among employees as a whole. Prominent

                                                                                              137
Chapter 5 Stakeholders and governance


                   examples of employee-owned firms include W. L. Gore & Associates, famous for Gore-Tex, the
                   Spanish Mondragon Cooperative, with 75,000 employees, and John Lewis, one of the UK’s
                   leading retailers. Typically these not-for-profits, partnerships and employee-owned firms are
                   restricted in their ability to raise external finance, making them more conservative in their
                   strategies. As the Thinking Differently illustration at the end of this chapter indicates, there
                   are also Benefit Corporations in the USA that formally tie themselves to social missions.
                       Clearly everybody should know how the ownership of their own organisation relates to
                   its strategy: as above, strategy for a state-owned business is likely to be very different to that
                   of a publicly-quoted company. However, it is also important for managers to understand
                   the ownership of other organisations with which they engage, for example competitors
                   and partners. Different ownership models will drive their strategic decisions in sometimes
                   unconventional directions. Without understanding the relationship between ownership and
                   strategies, it is easy to be surprised by competitors and partners with different priorities to
                   your own. For example, Western public mining companies have often found themselves
                   outbid for overseas mining opportunities by Chinese state-owned companies keen to secure
                   raw material supplies at almost any price.



5.3 Corporate governance
                   The varying power and attention of owners, and their frequent reliance on professional
                   managers, raise issues of corporate governance.16 Corporate governance is concerned with
                   the structures and systems of control by which managers are held accountable to those
                   who have a legitimate stake in an organisation.17 Key stakeholders in corporate govern-
                   ance are typically the owners, but may include other groups such as employee representa-
                   tives. Connecting stakeholder interests with management action is a vital part of strategy.
                   Failures in corporate governance have contributed to calamitous strategic choices in many
                   leading companies, even resulting in their complete destruction: in 2014, Portugal’s second
                   largest bank, Banco Espirito Sanctu, disappeared after the discovery of financial irregular-
                   ities involving €5bn losses. With the survival of whole organisations at stake, governance is
                   increasingly recognised as a key strategic issue.


                   5.3.1 The governance chain
                   Managers and stakeholders are linked together via the governance chain. The gover-
                   nance chain shows the roles and relationships of different groups involved in the
                   governance of an organisation. In a small family business, the governance chain is simple:
                   there are family shareholders, a board with some family members and there are managers,
                   some of whom may be family too. Here there are just three layers in the chain. However,
                   large publicly-quoted corporations have more extended governance chains, potentially
                   diluting accountability for strategy. Figure 5.5 shows a governance chain for a typical large,
                   publicly-quoted corporation. Here the size of the organisation means there are extra layers
                   of management internally, while being publicly-quoted introduces more investor layers
                   too. Thus individual investors (the ultimate beneficiaries) often invest in public corporations
                   through investment funds, i.e. institutional investors such as unit trusts or pension funds.
                   Investment funds then invest in a range of companies on behalf of beneficiaries, providing
                   them with limited reports on portfolio performance. In turn, the investment funds receive
                   reports from the companies they invest in, in the form of briefings and annual accounts, the
                   responsibility of company boards. Boards are themselves at the top of an internal chain, in
                   which each layer reports on performance against budgets and target, both quantitatively

                   and qualitatively (i.e. verbal reports). In sum, the managers at the bottom are accountable to
                   the ultimate beneficiaries at the top, but only through many layers of reporting. Beneficiaries
                   may not even know in which companies they have a financial stake and have little power to
                   influence companies’ strategies directly.
                      Economists analyse the relationships in such governance chains in terms of the principal–
                   agent model.18 Here ‘principals’ employ ‘agents’ to act on their behalf, just as homeowners
                   pay estate agents to sell their homes. Classically, the principal is simply the owner and the
                   agent is the manager. However, the reality for large publicly-quoted corporations is usually
                   more complex, with principals and agents at every level. In Figure 5.5, the beneficiaries are the
                   ultimate principals and fund trustees and investment managers are their immediate agents
                   in terms of achieving good returns on their investments. Further down the chain, company
                   boards can be considered as principals too, with senior executives their agents in managing the
                   company. Thus there are many layers of agents between ultimate principals and the managers
                   at the bottom, with the reporting mechanisms between each layer liable to be imperfect.
                      The governance issues in principal–agent theory arise from three problems:

                   • Knowledge imbalances. Agents typically know more than principals about what can and
                     should be done. After all, it is they who are actually doing the job and they have presum-
                     ably been hired for their expertise.

• Monitoring limits. It is very difficult for principals to monitor closely the performance of
  their agents. This limit is made worse because principals usually have many investments,
  so their attention is likely to be split several ways.
• Misaligned incentives. Unless their incentives are closely aligned to principals’ interests,
  agents are liable to pursue other objectives that reward them better. Principals might
  introduce bonus schemes in order to incentivise desired performance, but then agents
  may game the system: for example, they might use their superior knowledge to negotiate
  bonus targets that are in reality easy to meet.

Principal–agent theory therefore stresses the importance of knowledgeable principals, effec-
tive monitoring systems and well-designed incentives in order to make sure that large organ-
isations actually pursue the purposes that their owners set for them. Illustration 5.2 asks what
implications the principal–agent model has for Jamie Oliver’s business.


5.3.2 Different governance models
The governing body of an organisation is usually a board of directors. Although the legal
requirements vary in detail around the world, the primary responsibility of a board is typically
to ensure that an organisation fulfils the wishes and purposes of those whom it represents.
However, whom the board represents varies. In most parts of the world, private sector boards
primarily represent shareholders, but in some parts of the world they represent a broader
or different stakeholder base. In the public sector, the governing body is accountable to the
political arm of government – possibly through some intermediary such as a funding body.
These differences have implications for organisational purpose and strategy as well as the
role and composition of boards.
    At the most general level there are two governance models: the shareholder model, priori-
tising shareholder interests; and the stakeholder model, recognising the wider set of interests
that have a stake in an organisation’s success.19 These two models are pure types, and there
are many variants on each. The question for managers, therefore, is where their organisation
is positioned on the range between the pure shareholder and pure stakeholder models of
governance.

A shareholder model of governance
The shareholder model is dominant in publicly-quoted companies. Shareholders have priority
in regard to the wealth generated by the company, as opposed to employees for example.
The shareholder interest in a company is assumed to be largely financial. Shareholders can
typically vote for the board of directors according to the number of their shares, while also
exerting indirect influence through the trading of shares. Dissatisfied shareholders may
sell their shares, leading to a drop in the company’s share price and an increased threat to
directors of takeover by other firms.
   There are arguments for and against the shareholder model. The argued advantages
include:

• Higher rates of return. The unambiguous focus on shareholder interests means that
  investors typically get a higher financial rate of return than in the stakeholder model.
  Managers are not distracted by the interests of other stakeholders, and potentially have
  more money to invest in the future of the organisation.
• Reduced risk. Shareholders face less risk in the shareholder model, especially if operating
  within an economy with an efficient stock market. Shareholders can diversify their risk by
  using the stock market to buy shares in many different companies. They can also use the
  stock market to sell the shares of companies that look in danger.

                                                                                            141
Chapter 5 Stakeholders and governance


                   • Increased innovation and entrepreneurship. Since the system facilitates higher risk-taking
                     by investors, the shareholder model should promote entrepreneurship, innovation and
                     higher growth. It is easier to attract capital investment where investors know that they
                     can easily diversify their shareholdings and trade their shares.
                   • Better decision making. Arguably the separation of ownership and management makes
                     strategic decisions more objective in relation to the potentially different demands of
                     various owners. If ownership is widely spread, no one shareholder is likely to exercise
                     undue control of management decisions.

                   Potential disadvantages of the shareholder model include:

                   • Diluted attention. Where there are many shareholders, each with small stakes and often
                     with many other investments, the principal–agent problem is exacerbated. Any single
                     shareholder may not think it worthwhile monitoring performance closely, but rather
                     assume that other shareholders are doing so.
                   • Vulnerable minority shareholders. On the other hand, especially where corporate govern-
                     ance regulation is weak, the shareholder model can be abused to allow the emergence
                     of dominant shareholders. Such dominant shareholders may exploit their voting power
                     to the disadvantage of minority shareholders, for instance making acquisitions, guar-
                     anteeing debts or selling assets contrary to the interests of the other shareholders (also
                     principals).20
                   • Short-termism. The need to make profits for shareholders may encourage managers to
                     focus on short-term gains at the expense of long-term projects, such as research and
                     development. Some high-technology public companies adopt a dual-class shareholder
                     structure, where the original founders have more votes per share in order to protect these
                     companies’ commitment to long-term innovation. Thus Alphabet (Google) founders’
                     shares each carry ten times the voting rights of ordinary shares, and some shareholders
                     have no votes at all.

                   The stakeholder model of governance
                   An alternative model of governance is the stakeholder model. This is founded on the prin-
                   ciple that wealth is created by a variety of stakeholders, all of whom deserve a portion.
                   It is not just shareholders who have a stake in the future of a business. Thus in the stake-
                   holder governance model, management need to attend to multiple stakeholders. In some
                   governance systems, some of these stakeholders, for example banks and employees, may
                   be formally represented on boards (as at Volkswagen, see Illustration 5.3). Moreover, share-
                   holders in the stakeholder model often take larger stakes in their companies than in the pure
                   shareholder model, and hold these stakes longer term.
                       The argued advantages for the stakeholder model of governance include:

                   • Long-term horizons. It is argued that when shareholders hold large blocks of shares, they
                     are likely to regard their investments as long term. It is harder to dispose of large share-
                     holdings when business is going wrong, and the incentive to get involved in order to
                     maintain the value of the stake is proportionately greater. Thus the predominance of large
                     investors in the stakeholder model reduces the pressure for short-term results as against
                     longer-term performance.
                   • Less reckless risk-taking. Many stakeholders are more risk-averse than the diversified share-
                     holders typical in the shareholder model. Employees as stakeholders depend entirely on
                     their particular organisation for income and so may avoid risky projects because they fear
                     losing their jobs. Major shareholders have more to lose, and find it harder to exit in the

Chapter 5 Stakeholders and governance


                   • Better management. Given stakeholders’ concern for the long-term prosperity of the
                     company, there may be a closer level of monitoring of management and greater demands
                     for information from within the firm. Management are under greater pressure to perform.

                   There are also possible disadvantages to the stakeholder model of governance:

                   • Weaker decision-making. Intervention by powerful stakeholders with different interests
                     could lead to confusion, slowing down of decision processes and the loss of management
                     objectivity when critical decisions have to be made.
                   • Uneconomic investments. Due to lack of financial pressure from shareholders, long-
                     term investments may also be made in projects where the returns may be below market
                     expectations.
                   • Reduced innovation and entrepreneurship. Because investors fear conflicts with the inter-
                     ests of other stakeholders, and because selling shares may be harder, they are less likely
                     to provide capital for risky new opportunities.

                   The stakeholder model recognises that organisations typically operate within a complex
                   set of relationships, going beyond simple economic ones. As discussed in Chapter 2,
                   organisations participate in organisational fields in which legitimacy matters, not just
                   profits.21 Legitimacy typically means more than sticking to the letter of the law; it involves
                   following norms of appropriate conduct in the eyes of key members of an organisation’s
                   institutional field (e.g. governments, regulators, trade unions and customers, as well as share-
                   holders). Even firms operating on a shareholder model need to maintain legitimacy in their
                   field if they are to avoid interference by regulators, consumer boycotts and demoralised
                   employees. Shareholder model firms rarely wish to be seen as ruthless chasers after profit
                   at any cost.


                   5.3.3 How boards of directors influence strategy
                   A central governance issue is the role of boards of directors. Boards typically are made up
                   of executive directors, full-time senior managers within the company, and non-executive
                   directors, part-timers supposed to give an independent view. Since boards have the ultimate
                   responsibility for the success or failure of an organisation, they must be concerned with
                   strategy.22
                      Two issues are especially significant here:

                   • Delegation. Boards have to delegate a great deal to managers in order to get ordinary
                     business done. Here there is a risk that an organisation’s strategy becomes ‘captured’ by
                     management at the expense of other stakeholders.
                   • Engagement. Non-executive directors may wish to engage in the strategic management
                     process, but face practical problems in terms of the time and knowledge level required to
                     attend effectively to complex strategic issues. This problem can be especially pronounced
                     in organisations such as charities or public bodies, where directors are often people
                     passionately committed to the mission of the organisation, but without the time and
                     understanding to get properly involved (see Illustration 5.1 on Oxfam).

                   In the guidelines increasingly issued by governments23 or advocated by commentators there
                   are some common themes:

                   • Boards must be seen to operate ‘independently’ of the management of the company. So
                     the role of non-executive directors is heightened.
                   • Boards must be competent to scrutinise the activities of managers. So the collective experi-
                     ence of the board, its training and the information available to it are crucially important.

                                                                                               5.4 Social responsibility


                     • Directors must have the time to do their job properly. So limitations on the number of
                       directorships that an individual can hold are also an important consideration.

                     However, it is the behaviour of boards and their members that is likely to be most significant
                     whatever structural arrangements are put in place.24 Important, therefore, are respect, trust,
                     ‘constructive friction’ between board members, fluidity of roles, individual as well as collective
                     responsibility, and the evaluation of individual director and collective board performance.



5.4 Social responsibility25
                     An underlying theme in this chapter is the question of whether organisations are just for
                     the benefit of a primary stakeholder, such as the shareholders of a company, or whether
                     they have a responsibility to a wider group of stakeholders. This section considers the role
                     of corporate social responsibility in strategy.
                         The sheer size and global reach of many companies today mean that their strategies have
                     significant impacts on society: in 2018, Google accounted for three-quarters of all internet
                     searches worldwide, thereby shaping what sorts of products, services and information are
                     available globally.26 Governments, regulators, professional bodies, customers and activist
                     groups all exert pressure on such prominent companies for socially responsible behaviour.
                         The regulatory environment may determine an organisation’s minimum obligations
                     towards its stakeholders. However, stakeholders typically expect greater responsibility on
                     the part of organisations and managers’ own personal ethics are likely to set higher stand-
                     ards too. Corporate social responsibility (CSR) is the commitment by organisations to
                     behave ethically and contribute to economic development while improving the quality
                     of life of the workforce and their families as well as the local community and society
                     at large.27 CSR is therefore concerned with the ways in which an organisation exceeds its
                     minimum legal obligations. Increasingly, a company’s CSR stance becomes an integral part of
                     the overall strategy itself: a reputation for social responsibility can be a source of competitive
                     advantage (see Illustration 5.4: Unilever’s sustainability strategy).
                         Different organisations take different stances on CSR. Table 5.3 outlines four basic types to
                     illustrate these differences. They represent a progressively more inclusive set of stakeholder
                     interests and a greater breadth of criteria against which strategies and performance will be
                     judged. The discussion that follows also explains what such stances typically involve in terms

of the ways companies act.28 Illustration 5.4 discusses how leading consumer goods company
Unilever has managed to combine both financial and corporate social responsibility criteria
successfully over many years.

• The laissez-faire view (literally ‘let do’ in French) represents an extreme stance. In this view,
  organisations should be let alone to get on with things on their own account. Proponents
  argue that the only responsibility of business is to make a profit and provide for the inter-
  ests of shareholders.29 It is for government to protect society through legislation and regu-
  lation; organisations need do no more than meet these minimum obligations. Expecting
  companies to exercise social duties beyond this only confuses decision making, introduces
  additional costs and undermines the accountability of managers to their shareholders. In
  this view, society benefits anyway from the profits: after all, these can either be used for
  further investment in the business or be paid out to shareholders, who may be pensioners
  relying on the income or similar. This laissez-faire stance may be taken by executives who
  are persuaded of it ideologically or by smaller businesses that do not have the resources
  to do other than minimally comply with regulations.
• Enlightened self-interest is guided by recognition of the potential long-term financial benefit
  to the shareholder of well-managed relationships with other stakeholders. Here the justi-
  fication for social responsibility is that it makes good business sense. For most organisa-
  tions a good reputation in the eyes of customers and suppliers is important to long-term
  financial success. Working constructively with suppliers or local communities can actually
  increase the ‘value’ available for all stakeholders to share: for example, helping improve the
  quality of marginal suppliers in the developing world is likely to create a stronger overall
  supply chain; supporting education in the local workforce will increase the availability of
  skilled labour. Indeed, there is mounting evidence that responsible strategies can also reward
  shareholders.30 Thus, like any other form of investment or promotion expenditure, corporate
  philanthropy or welfare provision might be regarded as sensible expenditure. These enlight-
  ened self-interest organisations often provide Environmental-Social-Governance or Integrated
  reports, providing public indicators of their performance across a range of measures relating
  to the environment, human capital and governance arrangements for example.31
• A forum for stakeholder interaction32 explicitly incorporates multiple stakeholder interests
  and expectations rather than just shareholders as influences on organisational purposes
  and strategies. Here the argument is that the performance of an organisation should be
  measured in a more pluralistic way than just through the financial bottom line. Such organi-
  sations adopt the principle of sustainability in strategy, one that ensures a better quality of life
  by attending to all three dimensions of environmental protection, social responsibility and
  economic welfare. Performance here is measured and rewarded in terms of the triple bottom
  line – social and environmental benefits as well as profits (see Section 12.2.1). Companies in
  this category might retain uneconomic units to preserve jobs, avoid manufacturing or selling
  ‘anti-social’ products and be prepared to bear reductions in profitability for the social good.
  Sustainability will typically have board-level champions in these kinds of organisations.
• Shapers of society regard financial considerations as of secondary importance or a
  constraint. These are visionary organisations seeking to change society and social norms.
  Public-sector organisations and charities are typically committed to this kind of stance.
  There are also social entrepreneurs who found new organisations that earn revenues but
  pursue a specific social purpose (see Chapter 10 and Thinking Differently at the end of
  this chapter). For example, Traidcraft UK is a public limited company with a chain of retail
  shops that fights world poverty by promoting ‘fair trade’. For shapers of society, the social

                          Summary
                          • The purpose of an organisation will be influenced by the expectations of its stakeholders.
                            Different stakeholders exercise different influence on organisational strategy, dependent
                            on the extent of their power and attention. Managers can assess the influence of different
                            stakeholder groups through stakeholder analysis.
                          • The influence of some key stakeholders will be represented formally within the govern-
                            ance structure of an organisation. This can be represented in terms of a governance chain,
                            showing the links between ultimate beneficiaries and the managers of an organisation.
                          • There are two generic governance structure systems: the shareholder model and the stake-
                            holder model, though there are variations of these internationally.
                          • Organisations adopt different stances on corporate social responsibility depending on how
                            they perceive their role in society. Individual managers may also be faced with ethical
                            dilemmas relating to the purpose of their organisation or the actions it takes.

                             industries or an industry or public service of your choice (refer to Table 5.4). Compare
                             the approach of two or more organisations in that industry, and explain how this
                             relates to their competitive standing.
                       5.5* Using the stakeholder mapping power/interests matrix, identify and map out the

                             expectations about corporate social responsibility may require organisations to
                             deal differently with environmental opportunities and threats (Chapters 2 and 3) or
                             develop new capabilities (Chapter 4).

6.1 Introduction
          Many organisations have long histories. The large Japanese Mitsui Group was founded in the
          seventeenth century; automobile company Daimler was founded in the nineteenth century;
          the University of Bologna was founded in the eleventh century. But even newer organisa-
          tions are marked by their histories: for instance, the airline and consumer group Virgin is
          still influenced by its hippy origins from the early 1970s. Such histories become embedded
          in organisational cultures, shaping strategic options and decisions. Virgin’s culture is very
          different to that of its rival airline British Airways, which had its origins as a state-owned
          airline in the 1940s. Sometimes an organisation’s cultural heritage can give it a unique advan-
          tage, but sometimes it can be a significant barrier to change. Either way, if an organisation’s
          strategy is to be understood, so must the history and culture that influenced it. This is the
          focus of this chapter, as summarised in Figure 6.1.
              The chapter starts in Section 6.2 with history, examining its influence on organisa-
          tional strategy and considering how that history can be analysed. History shapes culture,
          so Section 6.3 moves on to examine cultural aspects of organisations, in particular how
          cultural influences at geographical, institutional and organisational levels impact current
          and future strategy. This section also explores how a culture can be analysed and its influence
          on strategy understood. Section 6.4 explains the phenomenon of strategic drift, a frequent
          consequence of historical and cultural influences and hard for managers to correct. Finally,
          Thinking Differently introduces the conflicts and diversity introduced by institutional logics.
              The theme of this chapter, then, is the significance of history and culture for strategy.
          A sense of history is important for environmental analysis, particularly understanding posi-
          tions on economic cycles (Chapter 2) or industry life cycles (Chapter 3). History and culture
          are relevant to the resources and capabilities of an organisation (Chapter 4), especially
          those that have built up over time in ways unique to that organisation. The power and influ-
          ence of different stakeholders (Chapter 5) are also likely to have historical origins. An under-
          standing of an organisation’s history and culture also helps explain how strategies develop
          (Chapter 12) and informs the challenges of strategic change (Chapter 15).

6.2 History and strategy
                    All organisations have histories, and even entrepreneurs creating new organisations have
                    their own personal histories. The past finds many kinds of echoes in the present. Sometimes
                    the past is important because it raises the costs of strategic change. Sometime the past can
                    be a managerial tool, something that managers can use either to reinforce existing strate-
                    gies or to support change. Because history can be both a constraint and a practical tool, it
                    is important to understand every organisation’s relationship with its past.1 This section first
                    examines four kinds of organisational relationships with the past, and then addresses ways
                    to analyse the strategic effects of organisational history.


                    6.2.1 Historical relationships
                    Figure 6.2 describes four kinds of relationship between the past and the present in strategy:
                    continuity, selection, rediscovery and rupture. The horizontal axis looks back from the present
                    into the past. The vertical axis offers a rough measure of the relative amounts of strategic change
                    accumulated over time involved in each relationship, with continuity the least, rupture the most.

                    Historical continuity
                    History often promotes continuities in an organisation’s strategy. In Figure 6.2, continuity is
                    represented by a simple horizontal line, with very little change. Here understanding the past
                    is important to evaluating the risks and difficulties of change. As we shall see in Section 6.3,
                    continuity often has cultural origins, but there are two material sources as well. In particular,
                    continuity can stem first from the unique resources and capabilities that an organisation has
                    and second from the ‘path dependencies’ created by past decisions.

                    • Historical resources. As in Chapter 4, organisations build their competitive advantages
                      on the basis of valuable, rare, inimitable and organisationally-supported resources and
                      capabilities (VRIO). Resources in particular are often acquired in extraordinary moments
                      of history. Thus the de Beers diamond company acquired its mines in South Africa when
                      the territory was a part of the British empire in the late nineteenth century: it is impossible
                      for competitors to go back in time to rediscover these uniquely rich mines and buy them
                      so cheaply. Facebook built up its two billion user-base as one of the first-movers in social
                      media in the first decade of this century: it is hard to imagine this asset being recreated in a

  similar way today. For both de Beers and Facebook, the historical moment of founding has
  given them resources that late-coming competitors will be hard-placed to replicate. Such
  historical resources can be the basis for hard-to-imitate strategies over long periods of
  time. Understanding and nurturing these resources are important to continuing success:
  it would be risky to throw them away.
• Path dependencies: sometimes organisations become locked-in to particular trajectories,
  or ‘paths’, by commitments made earlier in their histories. Path dependencies describe
  how early events and decisions establish ‘policy paths’ that have lasting effects on
  subsequent events and decisions.2 Path dependency is like the ruts made in a dirt track
  by passing vehicles over time. Vehicles have almost no option but to continue along those
  ruts: it is very difficult to switch to another track. Similarly, organisations can become
  dependent, or locked-in, on a strategic path that is costly to alter. Such lock-in could begin
  with a decision which, of itself, may not appear especially significant, but which then
  has unforeseen and hard to reverse consequences. For example, airlines easily become
  locked-in on particular aircraft types (e.g. Boeing): once systems for crew-training and
  spare parts availability have become optimised for one particular aircraft type, it is
  extremely expensive to move to another aircraft type (e.g. Airbus). As conditions change,
  path dependencies can be a source of dangerous inflexibility.

Managers should not think of historical resources only as positive. Sometimes such resources
can become what are called ‘competency traps’: here continuing with what the organisation
has been good at in the past traps it into strategies that are no longer relevant.3 Similarly,
path dependencies are not simply negative. In the short term at least, sticking to the existing
path may be highly efficient: there can be cost advantages to continuity.

Historical selection
In Figure 6.2, the second strategy highlights deliberate selectivity with regard to the past. The
dashed line represents elements from an organisation’s history that are selected for inclu-
sion in the organisation’s present strategy. The dashes indicate that the past is only partially
incorporated into the present strategy: there is not complete continuity; gaps exist that need
filling in. Over time, a fair amount of change can accumulate. While the past never repeats
itself perfectly, selective usage can be a valuable managerial tool in two ways:

• Historical learning. An organisation uses its past heritage as a resource for future innova-
  tions. In the BMW museum in Munich there is a quote: ‘Anyone who wants to design for
  the future has to leaf through the past.’4 BMW has sited its Innovation and Technology
  Division of BMW next to the company’s museum and archives in order to reinforce the
  relevance of the company’s history to new car designs. BMW’s designers can draw from
  the past inspiring ideas for the future.5
• Historical legitimation. The past can be used selectivity in order to legitimate strategies,
  even ones that might otherwise be thought of as new. For example, at technology enter-
  prise Hewlett Packard, CEO Carly Fiorina legitimised her strategy by summarising it in
  terms of ‘rules for the garage’, referring to the company’s famous origins in Dave Packard’s
  garage.6 The new strategy was not a simple replication of Dave Packard’s approach, but
  Fiorina’s use of a glorious past to explain her strategy made it easier for Hewlett Packard’s
  existing managers and engineers to accept what was new.


Historical rediscovery
Another form of change is that which rediscovers the old strategy. Such rediscovery often
comes after the failure of some newer strategy. As in Figure 6.2, the organisation returns


                                                                                             159
Chapter 6 History and culture


                    towards the old strategy after deviating from the original track. Although there is a return
                    to the past, added together, the switches between strategies typically involve a considerable
                    amount of accumulated change overall. As with the selectivity approach above, there are
                    legitimacy benefits here (and the rediscovery is unlikely to be complete), but this approach
                    is about turning back rather than justifying the new. Reference to the better times of the
                    past provides a clear image of what is required and makes the rejection of recent strategy
                    more absolute. Thus in 2018, the Italian fashion company Benetton, famous in the 1980s
                    and 1990s for its bright colours and bold advertising, reissued a line of T-shirts from the
                    last century. It also brought back as senior managers co-founder Luciano Benneton and his
                    sister Guiliana: the two were aged respectively 83 and 81. Luciano Benneton argued that, in
                    a time of disposable ‘fast fashion’, the Benneton tradition of durable classic designs could
                    be a source of renewed competitive advantage.

                    Historical rupture
                    Whereas the previous three relationships suggest various degrees of respect for history,
                    sometimes organisations present their strategies as radical ruptures with their past. Here
                    history’s purpose can be to sharpen the contrasts between the radical changes required in
                    the present and the unhelpful legacies of the past (indeed, the old is often simplified, in a
                    variant of the selective approach above). In Figure 6.2, rupture is represented by the abrupt
                    vertical shift in strategic direction. This kind of historical rupture is typically emphasised by
                    managers in two kinds of situation:

                    • Technological disruption. In the face of disruptive technologies (see Chapter 10), organisa-
                      tions frequently have to undertake revolutionary changes not only in their technologies,
                      but many internal systems and external positions in the marketplace. Hotels.com sees
                      the transition from its traditional internet hotel booking systems to the new cloud-based
                      systems as a major rupture with the past. The organisation’s chief data science officer says:
                      ‘At Hotels.com, we’re now over 20 years old, so even though we’re digital native, hopefully
                      soon we’ll become cloud native, which means reinventing ourselves internally.’7
                    • Organisational crises. Times of crisis often demand radical change strategies (see
                      Chapter 15), with clear breaks from the past. In 2018, the struggling American conglom-
                      erate General Electric broke with its 128-year history to appoint for the first time a chief
                      executive from outside the company, Larry Culp, former head of a rival conglomerate.
                      On his appointment, Culp evoked the American revolutionary Thomas Jefferson: ‘I’m a
                      life-long student of Jefferson, and have always been struck by the wisdom of what he’s
                      written about the benefits of revolution every 20 years or so.’



                    6.2.2 Historical analysis
                    If history matters so much, how might managers undertake an historical strategic analysis
                    of their own organisation or of their competitors? There are four ways this may be done:8

                    • Chronological analysis. This involves setting down a chronology of key events showing
                      changes in the organisation’s environment – especially its markets – how the organisa-
                      tion’s strategy itself has changed and with what consequences – not least financial. Organ-
                      isations will often provide a basic chronology on their websites, but crises and strategic
                      reversals are likely to be underplayed on these, so further analysis using media and other
                      sources will normally be useful.
                    • Cyclical influences. Is there evidence of cyclical influences? These include economic cycles,
                      but perhaps also cycles of strategic activity, such as periods of high levels of mergers and

                       acquisitions. Understanding when these cycles might occur and how industry and market
                       forces can change during such cycles can inform decisions on whether to build strategy in
                       line with those cycles or in a counter-cyclical fashion.
                    • Key events and decisions. History may be regarded as continuous but historical events can
                      also be significant for an organisation at particular points in time. These could be particularly
                      significant events, in terms of either industry change or an organisation’s strategic decisions:
                      for example, Apple remembers the return of founder Steve Jobs in 1997, 12 years after he
                      had previously been sacked. Or they might be policies laid down by a founder or defining
                      periods of time that have come to be seen as especially important: for example, Alex
                      Ferguson’s successful years at Manchester United. Key events or decisions could, of course,
                      be for the good: they may help provide a clear overall direction strategically that contributes
                      to the sort of vision discussed in the previous chapter. They can, on the other hand, be a
                      major barrier to challenging existing strategies or changing strategic direction. A famous
                      example is Henry Ford’s maxim ‘You can have any colour provided it’s black’, which set a
                      trajectory for mass production and low variety that inhibited the Ford company’s response
                      to the more varied cars eventually produced by General Motors and Chrysler in the 1930s.
                    • Historical story-telling. How do people tell their organisation’s history? As above, many
                      organisations will have parts of their websites dedicated to their histories, and some even
                      commission business historians to write books on their histories.9 The stories people tell
                      can offer revealing clues about how the organisation sees its past, not least in terms of
                      the origins of success. IKEA often tells the story of how flat-packed furniture began at the
                      company when a worker of the company disassembled a table to fit inside a car. And there
                      may be implications in their stories for future strategy development. For IKEA, the story
                      of flat-pack promotes practical improvisation in strategy. Does what people say suggest
                      an organisation with historic capabilities relevant to current markets and customers? Is
                      the organisation capable of innovation and change or so rooted in the glories of the past
                      that it will be difficult to change?

                       History, then, is important in terms of how it influences current strategy, for better or
                    for worse. History also feeds into organisational culture: history becomes ‘encapsulated in
                    culture’.10 The next section goes on to explain what culture is and how it can be analysed.



6.3 Culture and strategy
                    There are many ways to define culture, but typically definitions emphasise a set of taken-
                    for-granted beliefs and values that are shared within a particular group. What individual
                    managers believe in and value obviously influences their strategic decisions. Strategy is influ-
                    enced by culture, therefore. However, because we all belong to many groups, these cultural
                    influences can be very diverse. As in Figure 6.3, we shall analyse three kinds of cultural influ-
                    ences: geographical cultures, field cultures, and organisational cultures and subcultures, all
                    of which impinge on individual managers.


                    6.3.1 Geographically based cultures
                    Many writers – perhaps the most well-known of whom is Geert Hofstede of Maastricht
                    University – have shown how attitudes to work, authority, equality and other important
                    factors vary in different geographies, national or regional. Such differences have been shaped
                    by powerful forces concerned with history, religion and even climate over many centuries.
                    Hofstede traces cultural differences between the countries of southern and northern Europe
                    to the boundaries of the Roman Empire 2,000 years ago.11

              regional)
                                                                      profession)

   According to Hofstede, there are at least four key dimensions upon which national
cultures tend to differ:

• Power distance, referring to relationships with authority and acceptance of inequality. In
  Hofstede’s studies, and those of his associates, many Asian countries are found to have
  high power distance, and therefore quite authoritarian management styles. Australia has
  a low power distance and therefore is more democratic in style.
• Individualism–collectivism, referring to the relationship between the individual and the
  group. According to Hofstede’s research, some national cultures are highly individualistic,
  for example the United States. South American cultures are apparently more collectivist,
  valuing team approaches.
• Long-term orientation, referring to the extent to which people look to the future, some-
  thing essential to strategy. Hofstede suggests that many Asian cultures tend to be long-
  term orientated. North American and African cultures are supposedly more short term.
• Uncertainty avoidance, referring to tolerance of uncertainty and ambiguity. According
  to Hofstede, Japan is associated with relatively high intolerance for uncertainty. Chinese
  culture appears more pragmatic and accepting of uncertainty

   Hofstede’s research pioneered understanding about geographical variations in culture,
but it has since been criticised for its generalisations about whole countries. After all, coun-
tries vary widely within themselves: consider the cultural differences between different
regions in Nigeria, Southern and Northern Italy or the East and West Coasts of the United
States.12 Individuals too differ very widely within a particular geographical culture. It is
important not to stereotype. Nevertheless, certain national or subnational cultural tenden-
cies can be observed and Hofstede’s four dimensions are valuable in alerting us to some

                                                                                            163

                    of the ways in which people from different geographies may vary. When discussing stra-
                    tegic options in an international management team, it might be helpful to be aware that
                    not everybody will be equally comfortable with uncertainty, heroic individualism, the use of
                    authority to make final decisions, or projecting far out into the long-term future. For example,
                    the joint venture between American tire-maker Cooper and the Chinese tire-maker Cheng-
                    shan fell apart because of very different attitudes to acceptable levels of risk: the American
                    partner, backed by billionaire hedge-fund investor John Paulson, was much more aggressive
                    financially than the state-owned Chinese company.


                    6.3.2 Organisational fields13
                    As in Chapter 2, an organisational field is a community of organisations that interact more
                    frequently with one another than with those outside the field and that have developed a
                    shared culture. Fields can extend beyond the firms, customers and suppliers in particular
                    industries; they can include relevant regulators, professional bodies, university researchers,
                    specialist media and even campaign groups. An important characteristic of fields is that they
                    involve not just economic transactions, but shared assumptions and beliefs about how the
                    field works.
                       For example, in the organisational field of ‘justice’ there are many different types of organ-
                    isation, such as law firms, police forces, courts, prisons and probation services. The roles of
                    each are different, they all have their own specific organisational cultures and their detailed
                    prescriptions as to how justice should be achieved differ. However, despite their differences,
                    they are all committed to the principle that justice is a good thing which is worth striving for;
                    they interact frequently on this issue; they have developed shared ways of understanding
                    and debating issues that arise; and they operate a set of common routines helping them
                    interact with each other. Similar cultural coherence is common in other organisational fields:
                    for example, professional services such as accountancy and medicine or sectors such as soft-
                    ware development or journalism.
                       Where such shared assumptions and beliefs are powerful, these organisational fields help
                    set the institutional ‘rules of the game’ (Section 2.2.6) or ‘institutional logics’ (see Thinking
                    Differently on page 177). Fields influence the ways managers see their activities, define stra-
                    tegic options and decide what is appropriate. Three concepts are useful here:

                    • Categorisation. The ways in which members of an organisational field categorise (or
                      label) themselves and their activities have significant implications for what they do.14 To
                      categorise a mobile phone as primarily a personal computer or a fashion statement rather
                      than a phone changes the whole strategy. Over time, members of an organisational field
                      tend to converge on dominant categorisation schemes. For instance, the early car industry
                      had competing categories of ‘horseless carriage’ and ‘automobile’; in computing, there
                      were competing categories of ‘pen-computing’ and ‘tablets’ to describe more or less the
                      same thing. Converging on the categories of automobile and tablet helped define the
                      respective industries’ subsequent developments.
                    • Recipes. Because of their shared cultures, organisational fields tend to cohere around
                      standard ways of doing things, or ‘recipes’. A recipe is a set of assumptions, norms
                      and routines held in common within an organisational field about the appropriate
                      purposes and strategies of field members.15 In effect, a recipe is the ‘shared wisdom’
                      about what works best. In English Premier league football, the standard approach is a
                      ‘talent-based recipe’, where teams compete each year to hire the best players because
                      they believe that individual talent is what delivers results. An alternative recipe, for
                      instance of developing team spirit and skills over the long term as in Germany, is little
                      contemplated in the English Premier league.

                    • Legitimacy. Where categories and recipes have become strongly institutionalised over time,
                      they become the only legitimate way of seeing and behaving. Legitimacy is concerned
                      with meeting the expectations within an organisational field in terms of assumptions,
                      behaviours and strategies. By conforming to legitimate norms within the field, organ-
                      isations secure approval, support and public endorsement, thus increasing their legiti-
                      macy. Stepping outside that strategy may be risky because important stakeholders (such
                      as customers or bankers) may not see such a move as appropriate. Therefore, organisations
                      tend to mimic each other’s strategies. There may be differences in strategies between
                      organisations, but those differences tend to be limited by the bounds of legitimacy.16
                      Legitimacy helps explain why accounting firms and universities, for example, tend to
                      follow similar strategies to each other, promote similar products and hire similar people.


                    6.3.3 Organisational culture
                    Edgar Schein defines organisational culture as the ‘basic assumptions and beliefs that are
                    shared by members of an organisation, that operate unconsciously and define in a basic
                    taken-for-granted fashion an organisation’s view of itself and its environment’.17 Related to
                    this are the taken-for-granted ‘ways we do things around here’18 that accumulate over time.
                    So organisational culture is the taken-for-granted assumptions and behaviours of an
                    organisation’s members. This culture helps make sense of people’s organisational context
                    and therefore contributes to how they respond to issues they face.
                       An organisation’s culture can be conceived as consisting of different layers. The four
                    proposed by Edgar Schein19 are (see Figure 6.4):

                    • Values may be easy to identify in terms of those formally stated by an organisation since
                      they are often explicit, perhaps written down (see Chapter 1). The values driving a strategy
                      may, however, be different from those in formal statements. For example, in the early
                      2000s, many banks espoused values of shareholder value creation, careful risk manage-
                      ment and, of course, high levels of customer service. But in practice they indulged in highly
                      risky lending, resulting in the need for huge government financial support in the financial
                      crisis of 2008–09. It is therefore important to delve beneath espoused values to uncover
                      underlying, perhaps taken-for-granted, values that can help explain the strategy actually
                      being pursued by an organisation (see Section 6.3.7 below).
                    • Beliefs are more specific. They can typically be discerned in how people talk about issues
                      the organisation faces; for example, a belief that the company should not trade with
                      particular countries or a belief in the rightness of professional systems and standards.
                    • Behaviours are the day-to-day ways in which an organisation operates and that be seen
                      by people both inside and often outside the organisation. This includes the work routines,
                      how the organisation is structured and controlled and ‘softer’ issues around symbolic
                      behaviours (see Section 6.3.6 below). These behaviours may become the taken-for-
                      granted ‘ways we do things around here’ that are potentially the bases for inimitable
                      strategic capabilities (see Section 4.3) but also significant barriers to achieving strategic
                      change if that becomes necessary (see Chapter 15).
                    • Taken-for-granted assumptions are the core of an organisation’s culture which, in this
                      book, we refer to as the organisational paradigm. The paradigm is the set of assump-
                      tions held in common and taken for granted in an organisation. In effect these shared
                      assumptions represent collective experience about fundamental aspects of the organisa-
                      tion that, in turn, guide people in that organisation about how to view and respond to
                      different circumstances that they face. The paradigm can underpin successful strategies
                      by providing a basis of common understanding in an organisation but, again, can be a

  major problem when major strategic change is needed (see Chapter 15). The importance
  of the paradigm is discussed further in Section 6.3.6.

   The concept of culture implies coherence, hence the common expression of ‘corporate
culture’. However, there are at least two ways in which cultures can be subdivided in practice:

• Organisational subcultures. Just as national cultures can contain local regional cultures,
  there are often subcultures in organisations. These subcultures may relate to the struc-
  ture of the organisation: for example, the differences between geographical divisions in
  a multinational company, or between functional groups such as finance, marketing and
  operations. Differences between divisions may be particularly evident in organisations that
  have grown through acquisition. Also different divisions may be pursuing different types
  of strategy that require or foster different cultures. Indeed, aligning strategic positioning
  and organisational culture is a critical feature of successful organisations. Differences
  between business functions can also relate to the different nature of work in different
  functions. For example, in a major oil company differences are likely between those func-
  tions engaged in ‘upstream’ exploration, where time horizons may be in decades, and
  those concerned with ‘downstream’ retailing, with much shorter market-driven time
  horizons. Arguably, this is one reason why the oil company Shell took the decision to
  sell its retail outlets and other downstream activities. In strategic decision making, there-
  fore, it is important to recognise the different subcultural assumptions managers may be
  bringing to the processes: finance managers may have different subcultural assumptions
  to marketing managers, and so on.
• Organisational identity. An organisation’s culture covers a wide range of aspects, for
  instance how it sees its environment, but an important part is how the organisation
  views itself. Organisational identity refers to what members believe and understand
  regarding who they specifically are as an organisation.20 Managers and entrepreneurs
  often try to manipulate organisational identity because it is important for recruiting and
  guiding employees, interacting with customers and dealing with regulators. Organisa-
  tional identity claims are often prominent on websites and other official materials. Thus


                                                                                           167

                              the Danish lager company Carlsberg went through a very deliberate process of changing
                              its claimed identity from a brewer to a fast-moving consumer goods company, with
                              important ramifications for the skills it required. Plausible identity claims are important for
                              entrepreneurial start-ups also: there are significant benefits with customers and investors
                              if they can define themselves as the next generation, rather than a ‘me-too’.



                          6.3.4 Culture’s influence on strategy
                          Mark Fields, President of Ford Motor Company in 2006, famously argued that ‘culture eats
                          strategy for breakfast’, by which he emphasised the importance of culture in defining the
                          strategy of the business. The importance of culture does not mean that strategy is irrelevant
                          of course: culture should be seen as part of the strategy, something that can be a source of
                          competitive advantage and, to some degree, something that can be managed too.
                             The enduring influence of culture on strategy is shown in Figure 6.5. 21 Faced with a
                          stimulus for action, such as declining performance, managers first try to improve the imple-
                          mentation of existing strategy (step 1). This might be through trying to lower cost, improve
                          efficiency, tighten controls or improve accepted ways of doing things. If this is not effective,
                          a change of strategy may occur, but a change in line with the existing culture (step 2). For
                          example, managers may seek to extend the market for their business, but assume that it
                          will be similar to their existing market, and therefore set about managing the new venture
                          in much the same way as they have been used to. Alternatively, even where managers
                          know intellectually that they need to change strategy, they find themselves constrained by
                          path-dependent organisational routines and assumptions or political processes, as seems
                          likely in the case of Kodak (see Illustration 6.4). This often happens, for example, when there

are attempts to change highly bureaucratic organisations to be customer-orientated. Even
if people accept the need to change a culture’s emphasis on the importance of conforming
to established rules, routines and reporting relationships, they do not readily do so. It is a
fallacy to assume that reasoned argument necessarily changes deeply embedded assump-
tions rooted in collective experience built up over long periods of time. Readers need only
think of their own experience in trying to persuade others to rethink their religious beliefs,
or, indeed, allegiances to sports teams, to realise this. Changes in strategy which entail a
fundamental change to an organisation’s culture (step 3) are likely to be rare and triggered
by dramatic evidence of the redundancy of that culture such as a financial crisis or major
loss of market share.


6.3.5 Analysing culture: the cultural web
In order to understand the existing culture and its effects it is important to be able to analyse
an organisation’s culture. The cultural web22 is a means of doing this (see Figure 6.6). The
cultural web shows the behavioural, physical and symbolic manifestations of a culture
that inform and are informed by the taken-for-granted assumptions, or paradigm, of an
organisation. It is in effect the inner two ovals in Figure 6.4. The cultural web can be used
to understand culture in any of the frames of reference discussed above but is most often
used at the organisational and/or subunit levels in Figure 6.3.23 The seven elements of the
cultural web are as follows:

• The paradigm is at the core of Figure 6.6. As previously defined, the paradigm is the set of
  assumptions held in common and taken for granted in an organisation. The paradigmatic
  assumptions are, quite likely, very basic. For example, a common problem in technology
  and engineering firms is the propensity of people to focus on the technical excellence of
  products rather than customer-perceived needs. Or the paradigm of practitioners in the
  National Health Service in the UK is about curing illnesses. It is quite likely that, even if the

Chapter 6 History and culture


                       rational view is to build a strategy around the engineering firm’ customer needs or the
                       need for prevention (as distinct from curing) of illnesses, people in those organisations
                       may still interpret issues and behave in line with its paradigm. So understanding what the
                       paradigm is and how it informs debate on strategy matters. The problem is that, since it is
                       unlikely to be talked about, or even be something that people are conscious of, trying to
                       identify it can be difficult, especially if you are part of that organisation. Outside observers
                       may find it easier to identify simply by listening to what people say and emphasise. One
                       way of ‘insiders’ getting to see the assumptions they take for granted is to focus initially on
                       other aspects of the cultural web because these are to do with more visible manifestations
                       of culture. Moreover these other aspects are likely to act to reinforce the assumptions of
                       the paradigm.
                    • Rituals and routines point to the repetitive nature of organisational cultures. Routines
                      refer to ‘the way we do things around here’ on a day-to-day basis. At their best, routines
                      lubricate the working of the organisation, and may provide a basis for distinctive organ-
                      isational capabilities. However, they can also represent a taken-for-grantedness about
                      how things should happen which, again, can guide how people deal with situations and
                      be difficult to change. For example, managers trying to achieve greater customer focus
                      in engineering firms often report that customer-facing sales engineers routinely tend
                      to tell customers what they need rather than listening to their needs. The rituals 24 of
                      organisational life are particular activities or special events that emphasise, highlight or
                      reinforce what is important in the culture. Examples include training programmes, promo-
                      tion and assessment procedures, sales conferences and so on. An extreme example, of
                      course, is the ritualistic training of army recruits to prepare them for the discipline required
                      in conflict. However, rituals can also be informal activities such as drinks in the pub after
                      work or gossiping around water coolers. A checklist of organisational rituals is provided
                      in Chapter 15 (see Table 15.2).
                    • The stories told by members of an organisation to each other, to outsiders, to new recruits,
                      and so on, may act to embed the present in its organisational history and also flag up
                      important events and personalities. They typically have to do with successes, disasters,
                      heroes, villains and mavericks (who deviate from the norm). They can be a way of letting
                      people know what is conventionally important in an organisation.
                    • Symbols are objects, events, acts or people that convey, maintain or create meaning over
                      and above their functional purpose. For example, office furniture and layouts, cars and job
                      titles have a functional purpose, but are also typically signals about status and hierarchy.
                      Particular people may come to represent especially important aspects of an organisation or
                      historic turning points. The form of language used in an organisation can also be particu-
                      larly revealing, especially with regard to customers or clients: defining executive education
                      clients as ‘course participants’ rather than ‘students’ makes a significant difference to how
                      teaching staff interact with them. Although symbols are shown separately in the cultural
                      web, it should be remembered that many elements of the web are symbolic. So, routines,
                      control and reward systems and structures are not only functional but also symbolic.
                    • Power was defined in Chapter 5 as the ability of individuals or groups to persuade,
                      induce or coerce others into following certain courses of action. So power structures are
                      distributions of power to groups of people in an organisation. The most powerful individ-
                      uals or groups are likely to be closely associated with the paradigm and long-established
                      ways of doing things. In analysing power, the guidance given in Chapter 5 (Section 5.2)
                      is useful.
                    • Organisational structures are the roles, responsibilities and reporting relationships in
                      organisations. These are likely to reflect power structures and how they manifest them-
                      selves. Formal hierarchical and mechanistic structures may emphasise that strategy is the

170
                                                                       6.3 Culture and strategy


  province of top managers and everyone else is ‘working to orders’. Structures with less
  emphasis on formal reporting relationships might indicate more participative strategy
  making. Highly decentralised structures (as discussed in Chapter 14) may signify that
  collaboration is less important than competition and so on.
• Control systems are the formal and informal ways of monitoring and supporting people
  within and around an organisation and tend to emphasise what is seen to be important
  in the organisation. They include measurements and reward systems. For example,
  public-service organisations have often been accused of being concerned more with
  stewardship of funds than with quality of service. This is reflected in their control
  systems, which are more about accounting for spending rather than with quality of
  service. Remuneration schemes are a significant control mechanism. Individually based
  bonus schemes related to volume are likely to signal a culture of individuality, internal
  competition and an emphasis on sales volume rather than teamwork and an emphasis
  on quality.

Illustration 6.3 describes the culture of the American fund manager Vanguard Asset Manage-
ment (see also Illustration 7.1). It can be seen that the central paradigm of low-cost investing
has been supported by many mutually-reinforcing elements of the cultural web.


6.3.6 Undertaking cultural analysis
If an analysis of the culture of an organisation is to be undertaken, there are some important
issues to bear in mind:

• Questions to ask. Figure 6.7 outlines some of the questions that might help build up an
  understanding of culture using the cultural web.
• Statements of cultural values. As explained in Chapter 1 and Section 6.4.3 above, organ-
  isations may make public statements of their values, beliefs and purposes, for example in
  annual reports, mission or values statements and business plans. There is a danger that
  these are seen as useful descriptions of the organisational culture. But this is likely to be
  at best only partially true, and at worst misleading. This is not to suggest that there is
  any organised deception. It is simply that the statements of values and beliefs are often
  carefully considered and carefully crafted statements of the aspirations of a particular
  stakeholder (such as the CEO) rather than descriptions of the actual culture. For example,
  an outside observer of a police force might conclude from its public statements of purpose
  and priorities that it had a balanced approach to the various aspects of police work –
  catching criminals, crime prevention and community relations. However, a deeper probing
  might reveal that (in cultural terms) there is the ‘real’ police work (catching criminals) and
  the ‘lesser work’ (crime prevention, community relations).
• Pulling it together. The detailed ‘map’ produced by the cultural web can be a rich source
  of information about an organisation’s culture, but it is useful to be able to characterise
  the culture that the information conveys. Sometimes this is possible by means of graphic
  descriptors. For example, managers who undertook a cultural analysis in the UK National
  Health Service (NHS) summed up their culture as ‘The National Sickness Service’. Although
  this approach is rather crude and unscientific, it can be powerful in terms of organisa-
  tional members seeing the organisation as it really is – which may not be immediately
  apparent from all of the detailed points in the cultural web. It can also help people to
  understand that culture may drive strategy; for example, a ‘national sickness service’ will
  prioritise strategies that are about developments in curing sick people above strategies of
  health promotion and prevention. So those favouring health promotion strategies need
  to understand that they are facing the need to change a culture.

                    If managers are to develop strategies that are different from those of the past, they need
                    to be able to challenge, question and potentially change the organisational culture that
                    underpins the current strategy. In this context, the cultural analysis suggested in this chapter
                    can inform aspects of strategic management discussed in other parts of this book. These
                    include the following:

                    • Strategic capabilities. As Chapter 4 makes clear, historically embedded capabilities are,
                      very likely, part of the culture of the organisation. The cultural analysis of the organisation
                      therefore provides a complementary basis of analysis to an examination of strategic capa-
                      bilities. In effect, such an analysis of capabilities should end up digging into the culture of
                      the organisation, especially in terms of its routines, control systems and the everyday way
                      in which the organisation runs.

                                                                                                                   173
Chapter 6 History and culture


                    • Strategy development. An understanding of organisational culture sensitises managers
                      to the way in which historical and cultural influences will likely affect future strategy for
                      good or ill. It therefore relates to the discussion on strategy development in Chapter 13.
                    • Managing strategic change. An analysis of the culture also provides a basis for the manage-
                      ment of strategic change, since it provides a picture of the existing culture that can be set
                      against a desired strategy so as to give insights as to what may constrain the development
                      of that strategy or what needs to be changed in order to achieve it. This is discussed more
                      extensively in Chapter 15 on managing strategic change.
                    • Leadership and management style. Chapter 15 also raises questions about leadership
                      and management style. If one of the major requirements of a strategist is to be able
                      to encourage the questioning of that which is taken for granted, it is likely to require a
                      management style – indeed a culture – that allows and encourages such questioning. If
                      the leadership style is such as to discourage such questioning, it is unlikely that the lessons
                      of history will be learned and more likely that the dictates of history will be followed.
                    • Culture and experience. There have been repeated references in this section to the role
                      culture plays as a vehicle by which meaning is created in organisations. This is discussed
                      more fully in the Commentary on the experience lens and provides a useful way in which
                      many aspects of strategy can be considered (see the Commentaries throughout the book).



6.4 Strategic drift
                    The influence of an organisation’s history and culture on its strategic direction is evident in the
                    pattern of strategy development depicted in Figure 6.8. Strategic drift25 is the tendency for
                    strategies to develop incrementally on the basis of historical and cultural influences, but fail
                    to keep pace with a changing environment. An example of strategic drift in Kodak is given in
                    Illustration 6.4. The reasons and consequences of strategic drift are important to understand,
                    not only because it is common, but also because it helps explain why organisations often seem
                    to stagnate in their strategy development and their performance. Strategic drift also highlights
                    some significant challenges for managers that, in turn, point to some important lessons.
                        Figure 6.8 identifies four phases in the process of strategic drift, leading either to the
                    organisation’s death or to transformational change:

                    • Incremental strategic change is the first phase, involving small changes. In many organ-
                      isations, there are long periods of relative continuity during which established strategy
                      remains largely unchanged or changes very incrementally. After all, where the environ-
                      ment is changing slowly (as in Figure 6.8 at this point), there is no need for more radical
                      change. Where the pace of environmental change is slow, managers can also experi-
                      ment with a variety of small-scale responses to change, waiting to see what works before
                      adopting the best solution.
                    • Strategic drift emerges when the rate of environmental change starts to outpace the rate
                      of the organisation’s strategic change. Phase 2 of Figure 6.8 shows environmental change
                      accelerating. However, the organisation’s rate of change is still incremental, leading to a
                      growing gap with the accumulated environmental change.
                    • Flux is the third phase, triggered by the downturn in performance caused by the growing
                      gap between organisation and environment. In this phase, strategies may change but in
                      no very clear direction: changes may even be reversed, so that strategies loop back on
                      themselves. There may be internal disagreements among managers as to which strategy
                      to follow, quite likely based on differences of opinion as to whether future strategy should
                      rely on historic capabilities or whether those capabilities are becoming redundant.

                        2012 – or by takeover by another organisation; or (b) the organisation may go through
                        a period of transformational change, which brings it back to the level of cumulated
                        environmental change. Such change could take the form of multiple changes related to the
                        organisation’s strategy or perhaps a change to its whole business model (see Section 10.2),
                        as well as changes in top management, organisational culture and organisation structure.

                         Strategic drift is a common phenomenon. The consultants McKinsey & Co. point out that
                      the tendency is for ‘most companies to allocate the same resources to the same business units
                      year after year’.26 It usually takes significant performance decline to prompt transformational
                      change: a study of 215 major UK firms over the 20-year period 1983–2003 identified only
                      four that could be said to have both maintained consistently high levels of performance and
                      effected major transformational change over that period.27 There are three main groups of
                      reasons why it is hard to avoid strategic drift:

                      • Uncertainty. Strategic drift is not easy to see at the time. Chapters 2 and 3 provided ways
                        of analysing the environment, but such analyses are rarely unambiguous. It takes time for
                        managers to be sure of the direction and significance of environmental changes. Changes
                        may be temporary, for instance the result of cyclical downturns that will soon be reversed
                        or fashions that may soon pass. It is easier to see major and irreversible changes with
                        hindsight; it is less easy to grasp their significance as they are happening.
                      • Path dependency and lock-in. As in Section 6.2, the historical trajectory of the organisation
                        might lock organisations into strategies that are costly to change, at least in the short term.
                        For example, capabilities that have historically been the basis of competitive advantage
                        can be difficult to abandon in favour of developing new and untested capabilities. In this
                        sense, old capabilities can become core rigidities, rather than core competences capable
                        of supporting new businesses.28 Similarly, existing relationships can become shackles that
                        inhibit significant change.29 Thus managers may be reluctant to break relationships with
                        important customers, suppliers and employees built up over many years for the sake of
                        some emerging and uncertain opportunity.

                                                     Thinking differently institutional logics versus organisational culture


                       • Cultural entrenchment. As in Section 6.3, culture can exert a strong influence over strategy.
                         The paradigmatic set of taken-for-granted assumptions may prevent managers from
                         seeing certain issues: organisational identities (such as ‘we are a brewing company’, not a
                         ‘fast-moving consumer goods company’) can shape views of environmental opportunities
                         and threats. Performance measures embedded in the organisation’s control systems can
                         obscure the need for change. Thus many performance measures are lagged: in the early
                         stages of strategic drift, sales figures may hold up because of customer loyalty or long
                         customer waiting lists; profits may be buttressed by simple cost-cutting or staff working
                         harder in an unsustainable way.
                       • Powerful people, whose skills and power-bases relate to the old strategy, may naturally
                         resist change too. These kinds of issues are explored further in Chapter 15.

                       Thus history, culture and genuine uncertainty can easily support strategic drift. Rebecca
                       Henderson of MIT suggested how a Kodak executive might have responded to reports on
                       the threat of digital technology (see Illustration 6.4): ‘You are suggesting that we invest
                       millions of dollars in a market that may or may not exist but that is certainly smaller than our
                       existing market, to develop a product that customers may or may not want using a business
                       model that will almost certainly give us lower margins than our existing product lines. . . Tell
                       me again just why we should make this investment?’30




Thinking differently                             Institutional logics versus organisational
culture
Societal-level institutional logics can be both sources of conflict and sources of inspir-
ation for organisational cultures.

Institutional logics are socially constructed sets of material       These institutional logics mean that business decisions
practices, assumptions, values and beliefs that shape            are rarely purely business decisions. Familial responsi-

However, we remain sensitive to all these rules even when        alism or family spirit can be powerful ingredients in

   This notion of institutional logics comes from the insti-
tutional theory tradition associated with the concept of
organisational fields, with its emphasis on legitimate           Question
behaviour (see Section 6.3.2). It has at least two radical

                      Summary
                      • Historical resources and path-dependencies may exercise a considerable influence on
                        strategy. There are historical analyses that can be conducted to help uncover these
                        influences.
                      • Cultural and institutional influences both inform and constrain the strategic development
                        of organisations.
                      • Organisational culture is the basic taken-for-granted assumptions, beliefs and behaviours
                        shared by members of an organisation.
                      • The seven elements of the cultural web are useful for analysing organisational cultures and
                        their relationships to strategy.
                      • Historic and cultural influences may give rise to strategic drift as strategy develops incremen-
                        tally on the basis of such influences and fails to keep pace with a changing environment.

                      6.1✱ In the context of Section 6.2, undertake a historical analysis of the strategy develop-
                           ment of an organisation of your choice and consider the question: ‘Does history form
                           strategy?’
                      6.2    Identify an organisation that describes its culture publicly (use a Google search on
                             ‘our culture’ plus ‘business’ for example). What do they mean by culture and how
                             does it fit with the description of culture in this chapter?
                      6.3    Identify a company reputed to have a strong and positive culture (e.g. via Fortune’s
                             ‘Best Companies’, Glassdoor’s ‘Best Places to Work’, or LinkedIn’s ‘Most In-Demand
                             Employers’). What is attractive about this company’s culture, how is it sustained and
                             to what extent is it a competitive advantage?
                      6.4    Use the questions in Figure 6.8 to identify elements of the cultural web for Uber
                             (end of chapter case), Adnams* or an organisation of your choice (for example,
                             your business school).
                      6.5    Identify an organisation that, in your view, is in one of the phases of strategic drift
                             described in Section 6.4 (Google search ‘disappointing results’ or ‘slow growth’ plus
                             ‘business’ or ‘company’). How and why did it get into this state?

                      Integrative assignment
                      6.6✱ Choose an example of a major change in strategy of an organisation. Explain to what
                           extent and how its strategic capabilities and its organisation culture changed. (Refer
                           to Chapters 4, 6 and 15.)

Commentary on
Part I The strategy lenses
      The strategy lenses aim to help you explore strategy ‘critically’. Critical here is meant
      constructively: it is about asking better questions, generating new options, building stronger
      evidence and being more aware of different points of view. Ultimately, thinking critically
      should help you be more persuasive with regard to your own chosen positions, helping you
      convince your teachers, your fellow students or your work colleagues.1 Using the strategy
      lenses to explore strategic issues critically will help you both to generate additional insights
      and respond to possible counter-arguments against your own position.
         The last few chapters have already introduced many points of view, each offering different
      insights into what matters in strategy. Some of these reflect a strong economics orientation,
      for instance macroeconomic cycles and the Five Forces in Chapters 2 and 3. Others are more
      sociological, such as the highlighting of legitimacy in Chapters 2 and 5. Some concepts and
      frameworks emphasise opportunities for innovation, as in the strategy canvas of Chapter 3.
      Others stress conservatism in organisations, for example strategic drift and organisational
      culture in Chapter 6. Generally, the chapters assume objectivity in analysis, but issues such as
      the principal–agent problem in Chapter 5 warn of the scope for divergent political interests
      in organisations, while organisational culture too can be a source of bias. What should be
      clear from these chapters, therefore, is that there are many different ways of seeing strategy.
      Each of them suggests different questions, generates different kinds of insights and demands
      different types of evidence.
         The strategy lenses organise many of these different perspectives into four basic
      approaches to exploring strategic issues. Each of these lenses will help you generate distinct
      kinds of questions, options and evidence. They each have distinct implications for practice
      too.
         The four strategy lenses are as follows:

      • The design lens views strategy development as a logical process of analysis and evalu-
        ation. This is the most commonly held view about how strategy is developed and what
        managing strategy is about. Options and evidence here are generated by objective
        analysis using formal concepts and frameworks.
      • The experience lens views strategy development as the outcome of people’s taken-for-
        granted assumptions and ways of doing things. Strategy through the experience lens
        puts people, culture and history centre stage in strategy development. Options need to
        respect the past, and evidence is likely to draw heavily on previous experience.
      • The variety lens* views strategy as the bubbling up of new ideas from the variety of
        people in and around organisations. According to this lens, strategy emerges not just
        from the top, but also from the periphery and bottom of the organisation. It is important
        to question top management views, and recognise the potential value of options coming
        from all round the organisation, and even from outside.
      *In earlier editions the variety lens was called the ‘ideas lens’. The authors believe that the word ‘variety’ more accur-
      ately encapsulates the concepts explained in this section.

• The discourse lens views language as important both for understanding and changing
  strategy and for managerial power and identity. Through this lens, unpicking managers’
  language can uncover hidden meanings and political interests. Choosing the right
  language is also important to legitimating options and evidence.

   The critical exploration of strategy through these four lenses is useful because they all
raise different questions and suggest different approaches. Think of everyday discussions
you have. It is not unusual for people to say: ‘But what if you looked at it this way instead?’
Taking just one view can lead to a partial and perhaps biased understanding. Looking at an
issue another way can give a much fuller picture, generating new and different insights. For
example, is a proposed strategy the result of objective analysis or is it rather the reflection
of the proposer’s personal experience or political self-interest? The lenses can also prompt
different options or solutions to strategic problems. For example again, should organisations
rely just on top managers to create new strategies, or rather look towards the bottom of the
organisation to uncover existing experiments and initiatives that have greater potential?
Thus taking a critical perspective on strategy can help managers and students consider a
wider range of issues and responses.
   The rest of this Commentary explains the lenses in more detail, showing how they each
relate to the following three key dimensions of managing strategy:

• Rationality: the extent to which the development of strategy is rationally managed. The
  design lens assumes high rationality, but the other lenses question this.
• Innovation: the extent to which strategy is likely to develop innovative, change-oriented
  organisations, or alternatively consolidate past experience and existing power structures.
• Legitimacy: the extent to which strategy analysis and discourse is involved in sustaining
  managers’ power and identities in organisations.

   This Commentary concludes with a short case on Facebook, illustrating how the four lenses
can be used to explore a real company’s strategy. There will be shorter Critical Commentaries
later in the book helping readers to reflect on the concepts and frameworks highlighted
in Parts II and III. Meanwhile, this Commentary relates mostly to the material in the first six
chapters of this book.


The design lens
The design lens evokes an image of the strategist as detached designer, drawing up precise
blueprints distant from the messy realities of action. In terms of the three key dimensions,
the design lens therefore puts a strong premium on rational analysis and decision-making
(see Figure C.i).2 Because of its overt commitment to optimising the performance of organ-
isations, the design lens tends also to be highly legitimate. Rational analysis is what counts,
not passion or intuition. However, this commitment to dry analysis can sometimes work
against innovation.
   The design lens is associated broadly with strategy theorists such as the former Lockheed
Corporation strategic planner Igor Ansoff or the economics-trained Harvard Business School
Professor Michael Porter.3 It has its origins in traditional economists’ expectations about
perfect information and ‘rational economic man’, and is further informed by management
science techniques for resource optimisation. The design lens is also how strategy is often
explained in textbooks, by teachers and indeed by managers. The design lens makes the
following three assumptions about how strategic decisions are made:

• Systematic analysis is key. Although there are many influences on an organisation’s
  performance, careful analysis can identify those that are most significant. In this view,

                                                                                           185

                       tifying strategic capabilities using Valuable, Rare, Inimitable and Organisational support
                       criteria (Chapter 4), would be standard processes for estimating future performance.
                    • Analysis precedes action. In the design lens, strategy is generally seen as a linear process.
                      Decisions about strategy are separate from and precede implementation. From this point
                      of view, therefore, environmental analysis – for example projecting scenarios or fore-
                      casting industry life cycles (Chapters 2 and 3) – is the crucial first step in strategy-making.
                    • Objectives should be clear. Rational analysis and decision-making need unambiguous
                      criteria by which to evaluate options. Missions and visions (Chapter 1) should be set in
                      advance as precisely as possible, with little scope for adjustment as new opportunities or
                      constraints are discovered in action.

                      These design lens assumptions about how decisions should be made are in turn associated
                    with two key views about the nature of organisations:

                    • Organisations are hierarchies. It is the responsibility of top management to plan the
                      destiny of the organisation. The responsibility of the rest of the organisation is simply to
                      implement the strategy decided at the top.
                    • Organisations work mechanically. This hierarchical approach implies a view of organ-
                      isations as engineered systems or even machines. Pulling the right organisational levers
                      should produce predictable results. Principal–agent problems can be controlled by the
                      appropriate gearing of incentives (Chapter 5). Even organisational cultures (Chapter 6)
                      can be designed from above.


                    Implications
                    The design lens has practical implications for both managers and students. From the design
                    point of view, it is worth investing extensive time in formal analysis, especially economic
                    forms of analysis. Formal strategic planning and financial calculations are crucial parts of the
                    design lens approach. But even if strategic plans do not always produce the expected results,
                    there are two further reasons for taking a design lens approach:

                    • Dealing with complexity and uncertainty. The design lens provides a means of talking
                      about complex and uncertain issues in a rational, logical and structured way. Even if
                      rational analysis can sometimes over-simplify or convey undue precision, it is usually better

186

  than just concluding that everything is all much too complicated for any kind of plan or
  calculation. Strategy is more than guesswork.
• Meeting stakeholder expectations. As well as the sheer analytical value of a design
  approach, adopting rational procedures is something that important stakeholders (see
  Chapter 5) such as banks, financial analysts, investors and employees typically expect. For
  these audiences, analysis is highly legitimate. Taking a design lens approach is therefore
  an important means of gaining the support and confidence of significant internal and
  external actors.

Technical and elitist forms of strategy analysis can also have implications for managerial power
and personal identity. These side effects will be discussed further with the discourse lens later.
   In summary, the design lens is useful in highlighting the potential value of systematic
analysis, step-by-step sequences and the careful engineering of organisational objectives
and systems. However, the design lens does have its limits. In particular, a narrow design
lens tends to underestimate the positive role of intuition and experience, the scope for
unplanned and bottom-up initiatives, and the power effects of strategy analysis. Different
lenses can provide useful insights into these other elements of strategy.


Strategy as experience
The experience lens sees strategy as coming less from objective analysis on a clean sheet
of paper and more from the prior experience of the organisation’s managers. History and
culture matter. Strategy is shaped by people’s individual and collective taken-for-granted
assumptions and ways of doing things. As indicated in Figure C.ii, the experience lens there-
fore places less emphasis than the design lens on rationality. It also sets low expectations
in terms of innovation and change. Legitimacy is important, but this is defined in terms of
tradition, routines and culture rather than simple appeal to analysis and ‘the facts’.
   The experience lens is based on a good deal of research about how strategies actually
develop in the real world. As early as the 1950s, Nobel prize winner Herbert Simon was devel-
oping the so-called Behavioral Theory of the Firm, based on how managers really behave.4
Contemporary researchers into ‘Behavioral Strategy’ underline two kinds of problem for
rational analysis in practice:

• External constraints: Behavioral Theory points to real-world barriers to rationality: for
  example, it is difficult to obtain all the information required for comprehensive analysis;

Commentary on Part I: The strategy lenses


                       it is hard to forecast accurately in an uncertain future; and there are cost and time limits
                       to undertaking complete analyses. In these conditions, managers often ‘satisfice’ when
                       analysing strategic options: in other words, they settle for adequate solutions rather than
                       the rational optimum.
                    • Internal psychological limitations: Behavioral Theory underlines how managers suffer from
                      ‘bounded rationality’, human limitations on the intellectual ability to process information
                      and carry out analysis. They are also liable to ‘cognitive bias’: in other words, managers
                      tend to be selective in the attention they give to issues and often automatically favour
                      some types of solutions rather than others.

                    Cognitive bias is often based on managers’ experience, both individual and collective:

                    • Individual experience can particularly shape managers’ taken-for-granted assumptions
                      about what is important and what kinds of actions work best. Influential sources of
                      experience can be education and training. For example, accountants tend to see things
                      differently to engineers; MBAs are often accused of favouring excessively analytical
                      approaches to solving problems. Other kinds of influential individual experience are
                      personal careers. Thus a manager who had spent his or her career in the traditional auto-
                      mobile industry (for instance, Ford or BMW) might find it difficult to take seriously new
                      entrants such as Uber or Tesla. Differences in individual experience within an organisa-
                      tion can lead to debate and negotiation between managers with divergent views about
                      what is important and what should be done. Sometimes such negotiation can slow deci-
                      sion-making down and lead to excessive compromise. Stakeholder mapping (Chapter 5)
                      of different managers’ power and interest can be useful in resolving divergent views.
                    • Collective experience tends to form habitual patterns of thinking and acting, which can
                      translate into standard responses to strategic issues. One kind of collective experience
                      is encapsulated in organisational culture, as discussed in Chapter 6. Another kind of
                      collective experience is reflected by national culture: so for instance Chinese and American
                      managers may see the world differently (see also Chapter 10). A third kind of collective
                      experience is embodied in industry ‘recipes’ (Chapter 6), based on years of regular interac-
                      tion between existing competitors: for example, managers in the clothing industry come
                      to believe over time that style is important to success, even though new ideas from outside
                      the industry imply that new technologies may be the source of competitive advantage in
                      the future. By contrast with individual experience, collective experience tends to suppress
                      debate in management teams, and it becomes hard to challenge the consensus. A conse-
                      quence can be ‘strategic drift’ (Chapter 6), with everybody agreeing to continue as before,
                      even in the face of environmental change.


                    Implications
                    The experience lens has significant implications for strategy. First there are three important
                    warnings:

                    • Analysis is typically biased to some extent. All managers – and even students – bring their
                      own particular experience to any set of strategic issues. It is very hard to analyse a situation
                      as if from a clean sheet of paper. You should distrust claims to complete objectivity. Ask
                      yourself where people are coming from.
                    • Watch out for undue conservatism. Experience is likely to lead to routinised responses, even
                      to new problems. Tried-and-tested solutions become too legitimate; managers become
                      powerful because of successes experienced in the past. ‘Path dependency’ and ‘lock-in’ are
                      enduring risks (Chapter 6). Organisations can end up like old-fashioned generals, always
                      fighting the last war.

188
                                                     Commentary on Part I: The strategy lenses


• Change is hard. Because of conservatism, strategic change is liable to require long and
  difficult processes of persuasion (see Chapter 15). Continuity is often the default option.
  Relying on ‘objective analysis’ in making the business case for change will rarely win over
  hearts as well as minds.

On the other hand, the experience lens has some positive practical advice:

• Analysis can cost more than it’s worth. Because good information is hard and expensive to
  get, and because analysis can consume too much time, sometimes it is sensible simply to
  cut short information search and analysis. Depending on the availability of information
  and the ability to analyse it, beyond a certain point it might be sensible just to drop the
  analysis.
• Experience may provide the best guide. If analysis is not going to produce good answers,
  then relying on the rules-of-thumb (‘heuristics’) and instincts of experienced managers
  may be at least as effective. Sometimes a quick response that is half right is better than
  an analytical response that is only slightly better but much slower.
• Challenge the consensus. While established rules-of-thumb can be effective, sometimes it
  is necessary to challenge the consensus in an organisation. As in Chapter 13, ‘groupthink’
  is a risk. The need to challenge existing approaches is often the motivation for bringing
  in new leaders from outside the organisation in order to manage strategic change
  (Chapter 15).



Strategy as variety
The extent to which the design and experience lenses help explain innovation is rather
limited. The variety lens, on the other hand, emphasises innovation and change. However,
as indicated in Figure C.iii, the variety lens puts low value on rational analysis and tends to
give little weight to what is simply legitimate in an organisation. Viewed through the variety
lens, strategies are seen as emerging from the different ideas that bubble up from the variety
in and around organisations.
   The variety lens builds on two theoretical perspectives from the natural sciences, both
emphasising spontaneity. First there is evolutionary theory, in which natural phenomena
evolve through a Darwinian process of Variety, Selection and Retention.5 Various genetic
mutations emerge as more or less random experiments; some variations are selected for

                    success by their environments; and these successful variations may be retained over the
                    long term because of continuing good environmental fit. Second, there is complexity theory,
                    where phenomena are characterised by complex, dynamic sets of interactions, so that small
                    events can have surprisingly large effects.6 An example is the famous butterfly effect, where
                    the flap of a butterfly’s wings in Brazil triggers a series of escalating knock-on effects that
                    eventually cause a tornado in far-way Texas. In both evolutionary and complexity theories,
                    variety in the form of many small experiments or interactions can lead to large and enduring
                    outcomes. These outcomes are generated spontaneously, with very little top-down direction.
                       Moving from nature to strategy, the variety lens de-emphasises the deliberate
                    decision-making of the design lens. Likewise, the emphasis on spontaneity contrasts with
                    the conservatism of the experience lens. For human organisations, the three elements of
                    evolutionary theory work as follows:

                    • Variety. Organisations and their environments offer a rich ‘ecology’ for the generation
                      of different ideas and initiatives. There are many kinds of people and many kinds of
                      circumstance. Sales people working closely with customers may be able to sense new
                      opportunities at least as well as top managers at headquarters. Since people interact with
                      their environment throughout the organisation, new ideas often come from low down
                      in the hierarchy, not just from the top.7 Complexity theorist Bill McKelvey refers to this as
                      the ‘distributed intelligence’ of an organisation.8 Variety can even come from apparent
                      mistakes, just as genetic mutations come from imperfect genes. A famous example is
                      Post-it notes, which originated from an ‘imperfect’ glue being applied to paper, but
                      resulted in a semi-adhesive for which the researcher saw market potential.
                    • Selection. In nature, selection is ‘blind’, determined by environmental fit rather than
                      deliberate intervention. In organisations, selection can be nearly as blind, with strategies
                      selected more according to how well they match prevailing cultures or standard decision
                      rules, rather than by objective analysis and evaluation. In this view, there is an ‘internal
                      ecology’ within organisations, with ideas and initiatives winning out against competing
                      ideas and initiatives according to their internal fit.9 A good idea may fail simply because
                      it does not meet existing selection rules, regardless of its overall merits: for example, a
                      company may apply standard return on capital criteria that are outdated on the basis
                      of the current real cost of capital (see Chapter 11 on strategy evaluation). On the other
                      hand, as in complexity theory, ideas can gain rapid momentum as they attract ‘positive
                      feedback’: the support of one important set of actors can attract the support of another,
                      and the support of that set of actors attracts the support of still others, and so on in
                      an escalating process. Thus selection mechanisms can be self-reinforcing, speeding the
                      passage of both good and bad ideas.
                    • Retention. As well as processes of selection, there are processes of retention. Retention
                      refers to the preservation and reproduction over time of selected variations.10 Retention
                      may happen as particular policies or preferences become embedded in the organisation.
                      Retention may be achieved by instituting formal procedures: for example, job descrip-
                      tions, accounting and control systems, management information systems, training and
                      organisation structure. Often it is done through more informal processes of routinisation,
                      in which simple repetition of certain routine behaviours leads to the eventual imprinting
                      of such routines in the culture and capabilities of the organisation.


                    Implications
                    A key insight from the variety lens is that managers need to be wary of assuming they can
                    wholly control the generation and adoption of new ideas. However, there are a number of
                    things managers can do to foster initiatives and prevent the undue suppression of good

ideas. At the same time, the variety lens points both managers and students to distinctive
sources of innovation in organisations. We highlight three key implications:

• Allow for emergence. Rather than being deliberately designed, strategies often emerge
  from the bottom and the periphery of organisations, accumulating coherence over time.
  As in Chapter 1, Henry Mintzberg’s definition of strategy as an emergent ‘pattern’ rather
  than an explicit statement is widely relevant. Managers and students should not neces-
  sarily trust in the stated strategic vision and mission (Chapter 1), but rather look to what is
  actually happening, especially on the ground. The future of an organisation may well be
  emerging from somewhere far beyond headquarters’ formal initiatives. Indeed, in many
  industries, large firms frequently watch the interesting experiments and initiatives of small
  independent firms, and then buy them up.11
• Encourage interaction, experiment and change. From a variety lens point of view, organ-
  isations can be too stable and ordered. To generate variety, managers should promote
  potentially disruptive interactions across internal and external organisational bound-
  aries: cross-departmental initiatives are important internally and communication with
  customers, suppliers, partners and innovators should be extensive externally. Alphabet
  (formerly Google) encourages experiments by giving staff 20 per cent of their time to
  pursue their own projects. Complexity theorists prescribe regular change in order to stay
  at the dynamic ‘edge of chaos’, the delicate balancing point where organisations neither
  settle down into excessive stability nor topple over into destructive chaos.12
• Attend to key rules. If strategies tend to get adopted according to their fit with established
  organisational cultures or investment criteria, then managers need to attend at least as
  much to setting the context for strategy as to individual strategic decisions. As above,
  managers should create a context conducive to interaction, experiment and change. But
  they should particularly attend to the key selection and retention rules by which strat-
  egies are allowed to emerge. Drawing on complexity theory, Kathy Eisenhardt encourages
  the design of ‘simple rules’, a few clear guidelines for strategy selection and retention.13
  For example, the movie studio Miramax only selects movies that revolve round a central
  human condition (e.g. love), feature an appealing but flawed central character, and have a
  clear storyline. At the games company Valve, the rule is new games projects get automatic
  approval if three software engineers volunteer to work on them.14



Strategy as discourse
In many ways management is about discourse – i.e. talking and writing. Managers spend
75 per cent of their time communicating: for example, gathering information, persuading
others or checking up on progress.15 In particular, strategy has a high discursive compo-
nent, involving both talk and text. Strategy is debated in meetings, written as formal plans,
explained in annual reports and media releases, presented on PowerPoints, and communi-
cated to employees.16 The discourse lens recognises this discursive component as central to
strategy. Here, as indicated in Figure C.iv, the legitimacy of discourse is particularly important.
The importance of legitimacy, however, can work against both objective rationality and
organisational innovation.
   An important influence on the discourse lens is the work of the French philosopher Michel
Foucault. Foucault stresses the subtle effects that language can have on understanding,
power and personal identities. For example, he shows how changing scientific discourses
in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries redefined insanity as treatable illness rather
than natural foolishness.17 The insane now had a new identity, medically ill, and became
subject to a new power, the medical doctors with the task of curing them. In a similar way,

                    the ‘financialization’ discourse emerging in the 1990s and early 2000s sought to redefine
                    the purpose of the firm as solely about shareholder value, enhancing the power of investors
                    to insist on short-term financial results rather than long-term strategic investments.18 Those
                    taking a discourse lens are therefore sensitive to how strategy discourse can shape under-
                    standing, change personal identities and disseminate power.
                       These three effects of strategy discourse are explored as follows:

                    • Shaping understanding. The language of strategy has characteristics that make it
                      convincing to others.19 Its concepts and jargon have high legitimacy in many organisa-
                      tions. Here the discourse lens reveals the design lens in another light. The legitimacy of
                      strategy discourse gives the analytic apparatus of the design lens a persuasiveness that
                      often goes beyond the technical effectiveness of the analysis itself. Drawing on estab-
                      lished techniques such as Porter’s Five Forces (Chapter 3) or fashionable concepts such as
                      Blue Ocean strategy (Chapter 3) can add to the authority of strategic recommendations.
                      The ability to write inspiring vision and mission statements (Chapter 1) can help motivate
                      a whole organisation. The justification of strategic change by the radical rhetoric of hyper-
                      competition (Chapter 3) or disruptive innovation (Chapter 10) may give legitimacy to
                      radical actions that might otherwise be rejected as excessive.20 In other words, managers
                      draw on the rhetoric of strategy and the apparent ‘rightness’ of strategy concepts to
                      convince others they should comply.
                    • Defining identities. How managers talk about strategy also positions them in relation to
                      others, either by their own deliberate choice or as a result of how they are perceived.21
                      Discourse therefore influences the identity and legitimacy of managers as ‘strategists’. The
                      ability to use the rational analytical language of the design lens helps define managers
                      as legitimate participants in the strategy process. Of course, sometimes other kinds of
                      discursive identity may be appropriate. For example, in some contexts the language of the
                      heroic leader (Chapter 15) or the innovative entrepreneur (Chapter 10) might offer more
                      support for the decision maker’s identity than simple rational analyst. Whatever the precise
                      identity, the assumptions built into strategy discourse are liable to affect behaviour. For
                      example, lower-level managers and professionals who internalise the strategy discourse of
                      competitiveness and performance as part of their identities come to prioritise those values
                      in their everyday work, subordinating to some degree the administrative or professional
                      values (such as equity or care) that might otherwise be important in their roles.

                                                     Commentary on Part I: The strategy lenses


• Instrument of power. Here strategy discourse is linked to power and control.22 By under-
  standing the concepts of strategy, or being seen to do so, top managers or strategy special-
  ists are positioned as having the knowledge about how to deal with the really difficult
  problems the organisation faces. The possession of such knowledge gives them power
  over others who do not have it. Design lens discourse, with its commitment to demanding
  forms of technical analysis, can be particularly elitist and exclusive. Thus mastering the
  discursive language of the design lens offers a political advantage as well as an analytical
  one. At the same time, the internalisation of strategy discourse by employees renders
  them more compliant to the strategy: they see pursuing the strategy as a natural part of
  their role. In this sense discourse is associated with power when it attracts followers and
  is self-reproducing and self-reinforcing. Insofar as strategy discourse serves the interests
  of the powerful, it may suppress innovation and change and distort objective rational
  analysis from the point of view of the organisation as a whole.


Implications
The discourse lens suggests the importance of the appearance, as well as the reality, of
rational argument. Through the discourse lens, strategies need to be legitimate, not simply
correct. Strategy discourse, moreover, helps define legitimate participants in strategic
decision making and gives power to the decisions that are ultimately made. The fundamental
lesson for managers and students is that the language of strategy matters.
   The implications of the discourse lens have both instrumental and critical aspects:

• Use strategy discourse skilfully. The right discourse can add legitimacy to particular strat-
  egies or individuals in an organisation.23 This discourse needs to match particular contexts
  and circumstances. Justifying a strategy to a potential investor may call for a logical,
  highly quantitative financial case; explaining the same strategy to employees may involve
  emphasising implications for job security and career growth. For some organisations, the
  analytic discourse of the design lens will be a legitimate mode of justification; in other
  organisations, appeal to technical or professional values may be more effective. The instru-
  mental value of the discourse lens lies in this: using the right language matters both for
  justifying and imposing strategies and for participating in strategy discussions in the first
  place.
• Treat strategy discourse sceptically. Just as strategy discourse can be used instrumentally,
  so should managers and students be ready to take a critical perspective towards such
  discourse. Are concepts and frameworks being used as a smokescreen for some particular
  individuals or groups to advance their sectional power and interests, as for example ‘finan-
  cialization’ discourse did for investors? Are strengths and weaknesses, threats and oppor-
  tunities (Chapter 4) being mystified or exaggerated? Are the grandiose ambitions of vision
  and mission statements just empty rhetoric (Chapter 1)? Seeing strategy as discourse can
  prompt the healthy questioning of concepts, ideas and rhetorics that might otherwise be
  taken for granted. The discourse lens encourages managers and students to see through
  the surface language of strategy to uncover the deeper interests and motives behind it.
  Adopters of the discourse lens are naturally sceptical.

Commentary on Part I: The strategy lenses


                     a whole is merely an introduction and you may usefully explore each of the lenses further
                     yourself. After all, each of the lenses presented here actually includes several perspectives
                     themselves. For example, the variety lens builds on both evolutionary theory and complexity
                     theory, each of which offers distinctive points of their own. So, within these lenses there
                     are finer-grained insights to discover. The references at the end of this Commentary should
                     help with deeper exploration of the lenses. In addition, there are whole books written that
                     provide multiple perspectives on strategy, from the four different ones that Richard Whit-
                     tington offers, to the ten of Henry Mintzberg and his co-authors, or even the 13 ‘images’
                     provided in the collection by Stephen Cummings and David Wilson.24
                        However, the overarching message that comes from all four lenses is this: in considering
                     a topic like strategy, it is useful to take a critical approach. Being critical involves recognising
                     that one lens is probably not enough, and that every lens has its own value and limitations.
                     You should not necessarily be satisfied with just the rational analysis of the design lens. Use
                     the experience lens to consider sources of unconscious bias; take a variety lens approach
                     to be sensitive to spontaneous initiatives from the bottom or periphery; stay sceptical by
                     interpreting strategy talk through the discourse lens. It is because different perspectives are
                     important that we shall return to the four lenses in the critical commentaries at the ends
                     of Parts II and III of this book. Throughout your course, we encourage you to approach the
                     topics of strategy with eyes open to different points of view. To get into the habit, you might
                     now want to consider the short Facebook case through the four strategy lenses.

Strategic choices
This part explains strategic choices in terms of:
• How organisations relate to competitors in terms
  of their competitive business strategies.
• How broad and diverse organisations should be in
  terms of their corporate portfolios.
• How far organisations should extend themselves
  internationally.
• How organisations are created and innovate.
• How organisations pursue strategies through
  organic development, acquisitions or strategic
  alliances.

                    • Choices as to how an organisation at a business level positions itself in relation to compet-
                      itors. This is a matter of deciding how to compete in a market. For example, should the
                      business compete on the basis of cost or differentiation? Or is competitive advantage
                      possible through being more flexible and fleet-of-foot than competitors? Or is a more
                      cooperative approach to competitors appropriate? These business strategy questions,
                      together with business model considerations, are addressed in Chapter 7.
                    • Choices of strategic direction: in other words, which products, industries and markets to
                      pursue. Should the organisation be very focused on just a few products and markets?
                      Or should it be much broader in scope, perhaps very diversified in terms of both prod-
                      ucts (or services) and markets? Should it create new products or should it enter new
                      territories? These questions relate to corporate strategy, addressed in Chapter 8, inter-
                      national strategy in Chapter 9 and innovation and entrepreneurial strategy, as discussed
                      in Chapter 10.
                    • Choices about methods by which to pursue strategies. For any of these choices, should
                      they be pursued independently by organic development, by acquisitions or by strategic
                      alliances with other organisations? This is the theme of Chapter 11.

                    The discussion in these chapters provides frameworks and rationales for a wide range of
                    strategic choices. But some words of warning are important here:

                    • Strategic choices relate back to analysis of strategic position. Part I of the book has provided
                      ways in which strategists can understand the macro environment (Chapter 2), identify
                      forces at work in the industry and sector (Chapter 3), identify and build on resources and
                      capabilities (Chapter 4), meet stakeholder expectations (Chapter 5) and build on the bene-
                      fits, as well as be aware of the constraints, of their organisation’s historical and cultural
                      context (Chapter 6). Exploring these issues will provide the foundation for considering
                      strategic options. However, the Exploring Strategy Framework (Figure 1.3) implies that
                      issues of position, choice and action overlap. Thus working through the choices of Part II is

  also likely to feed back into the initial analysis of strategic position. Similarly, the potential
  of some strategic choices will only be revealed in action, the theme of Part III.
• Key strategic issues. Choices have to be made in the context of an organisation’s strategic
  position, of course. But here it is important that the analysis of strategic position distin-
  guishes the key strategic issues from all the many positioning issues that are likely to arise.
  Analysis needs to avoid producing a very long list of observations without any clarity of
  what such key issues are. There is no single ‘strategy tool’ for this. Identifying key strategic
  issues is a matter of informed judgement and, because managers usually work in groups,
  of debate. The analytic tools provided can help, but are not a substitute for judgement.

7.1 Introduction
          This chapter is about two fundamental strategic choices: what business strategy and what
          business model should a company, business unit or other organisation adopt in its market?
          Business strategies are about how to compete in a marketplace so that a restaurant for instance
          has to decide a range of issues such as food concept, menus, décor and prices in the light of
          local competition from other restaurants. Business strategy questions are fundamental both
          to standalone small businesses and to all the many business units that typically make up large
          diversified organisations. Large diversified corporations thus typically include many decen-
          tralised ‘strategic business units’ in different product or market areas each with its own business
          strategy depending on the specific needs of their served market. A strategic business unit
          (SBU) supplies goods or services for a distinct domain of activity (sometimes these SBUs
          are called ‘divisions’ or ‘profit centres’). For example, Nestlé’s ice-cream SBU has to decide how
          to compete against smaller and local artisanal companies with new imaginative flavours and
          different customer focus, distribution channels and pricing. These kinds of business strategy
          issues are distinct from the question as to whether Nestlé should own an ice-cream business in
          the first place: this is a matter of corporate strategy, the subject of Chapter 8.
             Another important choice is to identify the relationship between the value created for
          customers and other participants, the organisational activities that create this value and how
          the organisation and other participants can capture value from this – a business model. For
          instance, Amazon was a pioneer with its e-commerce business model that contrasted with
          bricks-and-mortar retailers. Over time, however, business models get established and many
          other retailers also entered into e-commerce. This shows that organisations need to consider
          what business model to build on – established or new ones or both.
             Figure 7.1 shows the main three themes that provide the structure for the rest of the chapter:

          • Generic competitive strategies, including cost leadership, differentiation, focus and hybrid
            strategies.
          • Interactive strategies, building on the notion of generic strategies to consider interaction
            with competitors, especially in hypercompetitive environments, and including choices
            between competition and cooperation based on game theory.
          • Business models, including the three basic components of value creation, value configur-
            ation and value capture.

Chapter 7 Business strategy and models


                       Business strategy and business models are not just relevant to the private business sector.
                   Charities and public-sector organisations also compete and have business models. Thus char-
                   ities compete between each other for support from donors. Public-sector organisations also
                   need to be ‘competitive’ against comparable organisations in order to satisfy their stake-
                   holders, secure their funding and protect themselves from alternative suppliers from the
                   private sector. Schools compete in terms of examination results, while hospitals compete
                   in terms of waiting times, treatment survival rates and so on. Likewise, these sectors need
                   to consider what value is created for whom and how organisational activities contribute
                   to this in a business model. Although some of the detailed implications may vary between
                   sectors, wherever comparison is possible with other similar organisations, basic principles of
                   business strategy and models are likely to be relevant. Very few organisations can afford to
                   be demonstrably inferior to peers. Most have to make choices on key competitive variables
                   such as costs, prices and quality.



7.2 Generic competitive strategies
                   This section introduces the competitive element of business strategy, with cooperation
                   addressed particularly in Section 7.3. Competitive strategy is concerned with how a
                   company, business unit or organisation achieves competitive advantage in its domain
                   of activity. Competitive strategy therefore involves issues such as costs, product and service
                   features and branding. In turn, competitive advantage is about how a company, business
                   unit or organisation creates value for its users both greater than the costs of supplying
                   them and superior to that of rivals. Competitive advantages should underpin competitive
                   strategies. There are two important features of competitive advantage. To be competitive at
                   all, an organisation must ensure that customers see sufficient value that they are prepared
                   to pay more than the costs of supply. To have an advantage, the organisation must be able
                   to create greater value than competitors. In the absence of a competitive advantage, an
                   organisation’s competitive strategy is always vulnerable to competitors with better products
                   or offering lower prices.
                       There are two fundamental means of achieving competitive advantage. An organisation
                   can have structurally lower costs than its competitors. Or it can have products or services
                   that are differentiated from competitors’ products or services in ways that are so valued by
                   customers that it can charge higher prices that cover the additional costs of the differentia-
                   tion. In defining competitive strategies, Michael Porter adds a further dimension based on
                   the scope of customers that the business chooses to serve.1 Businesses can choose to focus on
                   narrow customer segments, for example a particular demographic group such as the youth
                   market. Alternatively, they can adopt a broad scope, targeting customers across a range of
                   characteristics such as age, wealth or geography.
                       Porter’s distinctions between cost, differentiation and scope define a set of ‘generic’ strat-
                   egies: in other words, basic types of strategy that hold across many kinds of business situa-
                   tions. These three generic strategies are illustrated in Figure 7.2. In the top left-hand corner is
                   a strategy of cost leadership, as exemplified in the British food and grocery market by retailers
                   such as Asda. Asda seeks to use huge economies of scale and extremely tight cost disci-
                   pline to achieve systematically lower costs compared to competitors. Waitrose, in contrast,
                   pursues a strategy of differentiation, offering a range of quality, fresh and environmentally
                   friendly products focused on the upper market with relatively higher prices. Porter distin-
                   guishes between cost focus and differentiation focus, but for him narrow scope is such a
                   distinctive fundamental principle that these two are merely variations on the same basic

theme of narrowness. For example, delicatessens target a relative narrow group of higher
end customers with their high food quality and provenance. They thus often achieve a
higher price for their distinctive products through their differentiation focus strategy. On the
other hand, Iceland Foods has a cost focus strategy concentrated on frozen and chilled foods
that reduces costs compared to generalist competitors with broader product ranges. The rest
of this section discusses these three generic strategies in more detail.


7.2.1 Cost leadership strategy
Cost-leadership strategy involves becoming the systematically lowest-cost organisation
in a domain of activity. For example, Ryanair pursues a relentless low-cost strategy in the
European airline industry. The airline saves costs in virtually every aspect of its operation from
purchasing a single type of aircraft (without reclining seats) to selling tickets primarily online
(over 90 per cent of sales) to low employee costs (second lowest in Europe). There are four
key cost drivers that can help deliver cost leadership, as follows:

• Input costs are often very important, for example labour or raw materials. Many companies
  seek competitive advantage through locating their labour-intensive operations in coun-
  tries with low labour costs. Examples might be service call centres in India or manufac-
  turing in South East Asia and China. Location close to raw material sources can also be
  advantageous, as for example the Brazilian steel producer CSN which benefits from its
  own local iron-ore facilities.
• Economies of scale refer to how increasing scale usually reduces the average costs of
  operation over a particular time period, perhaps a month or a year. Economies of scale
  are important wherever there are high fixed costs. Fixed costs are those costs necessary
  for a level of output: for example, a pharmaceutical manufacturer typically needs to do
  extensive R&D before it produces a single pill. Economies of scale come from spreading
  these fixed costs over high levels of output: the average cost due to an expensive R&D
  project halves when output increases from one million to two million units. Economies of
  scale in purchasing can also reduce input costs. The large airlines, for example, are able to



                                                                                                                  205

                      negotiate steep discounts from aircraft manufacturers. For the cost-leader, it is important
                      to reach the output level equivalent to the minimum efficient scale. Note, though, that
                      diseconomies of scale are possible. Large volumes of output that require special overtime
                      payments to workers or involve the neglect of equipment maintenance can soon become
                      very expensive. As to the left in Figure 7.3, therefore, the economies of scale curve is
                      typically somewhat U-shaped, with the average cost per unit actually increasing beyond
                      a certain point.
                   • Experience2 can be a key source of cost efficiency. The experience curve implies that the
                     cumulative experience gained by an organisation with each unit of output leads to reduc-
                     tions in unit costs (see Figure 7.3 to the right). For example, for many electronic compo-
                     nents per unit costs can drop as much as 95 per cent every time the accumulated volume
                     doubles. There is no time limit: simply the more experience an organisation has in an
                     activity, the more efficient it gets at doing it. The efficiencies are basically of two sorts.
                     First, there are gains in labour productivity as staff simply learn to do things more cheaply
                     over time (this is the specific learning curve effect). Second, costs are saved through more
                     efficient designs or equipment as experience shows what works best. The experience
                     curve has three important implications for business strategy. First, entry timing into a
                     market is important: early entrants into a market will have experience that late entrants
                     do not yet have and so will gain a cost advantage. Second, it is important to gain and hold
                     market share, as companies with higher market share have more ‘cumulative experience’
                     simply because of their greater volumes. Finally, although the gains from experience
                     are typically greatest at the start, as indicated by the steep initial curve to the right in
                     Figure 7.3, improvements normally continue over time. Opportunities for cost reduction
                     are theoretically endless. Figure 7.3 compares the experience curve (to the right) and
                     economies of scale (to the left) in order to underline the contrast here. Unlike scale, where
                     diseconomies appear beyond a certain point, the experience curve implies at worst a flat-
                     tening of the rate of cost reduction. However, completely new production technologies
                     from competitors can potentially introduce even steeper experience effects and further
                     improved cost savings.
                   • Product/process design also influences cost. Efficiency can be ‘designed in’ at the outset.
                     For example, engineers can choose to build a product from cheap standard components
                     rather than expensive specialised components. Organisations can choose to interact with
                     customers exclusively through cheap web-based methods, rather than via telephone or
                     stores. Organisations can also tailor their offerings in order to meet the most important
                     customer needs, saving money by ignoring others.

    There are two tough requirements for cost-based strategies. First of all, the principle of
competitive advantage indicates that a business’s cost structure needs to be systematically
lowest cost (i.e. lower than all competitors’). Having the second-lowest cost structure implies
a competitive disadvantage against somebody. Competitors with higher costs than the
cost-leader are always at risk of being undercut on price, especially in market downturns.
For businesses competing on a cost basis, systematic cost leadership is always more secure
than being second or third in terms of costs. The US financial investments company Vanguard
is a good example of this, as discussed in Illustration 7.1 (see also Illustration 6.3).
    The second requirement is that low cost should not be pursued in total disregard for
quality. To sell its products or services, the cost-leader has to be able to meet market stand-
ards. For example, low-cost Chinese car producers exporting to Western markets need
to offer not only cars that are cheap, but cars that meet acceptable norms in terms of
style, safety, service network, reliability, resale value and other important characteristics.
Cost-leaders have two options here:

• Parity (in other words, equivalence) with competitors in product or service features valued
  by customers. Parity allows the cost-leader to charge the same prices as the average
  competitor in the marketplace, while translating its cost advantage wholly into extra
  profit (as in the second column of Figure 7.4). The Brazilian steel producer CSN, with its
  cheap iron-ore sources, is able to charge the average price for its steel and take the cost
  difference in greater profit.
• Proximity (closeness) to competitors in terms of features. Where a competitor is suffi-
  ciently close to competitors in terms of product or service features, customers may only
  require small cuts in prices to compensate for the slightly lower quality. As in the third
  column in Figure 7.4, the proximate cost-leader still earns better profits than the average
  competitor because its lower price eats up only a part of its cost advantage. This proximate
  cost-leadership strategy might be the option chosen initially by Chinese car manufacturers
  in export markets, for example.

7.2.2 Differentiation strategy
The principal alternative to cost leadership is differentiation.3 Differentiation strategy
involves uniqueness along some dimension that is sufficiently valued by customers
to allow a price premium. For example, German manufacturer Miele pursues a differ-
entiation strategy in the domestic appliance industry. Its European manufactured,
high-quality and durable dishwashers, washing machines and stoves are targeted towards
higher income households at a price premium. Relevant points of differentiation vary
between markets. Within each market too, businesses may differentiate along different
dimensions. In clothing retail, competitors may differentiate by store size, locations or
fashion. In cars, competitors may differentiate by safety, style or fuel efficiency. Where there
are many alternative dimensions that are valued by customers, it is possible to have many
different types of differentiation strategy in a market. Thus, even at the same top end of
the car market, BMW and Mercedes differentiate in different ways, the first typically with a
sportier image, the second with more conservative values. In brief, there are various aspects
to consider in pursuing a differentiation strategy and below are three primary differenti-
ation drivers to consider:

• Product and service attributes. Certain product attributes can provide better or unique
  features than comparable products or services for the customer. For example, the Dyson
  vacuum cleaner with its unique technology provides customers with a better suction
  performance compared to competitors. The possibilities of product differentiation are,
  however, virtually endless and only limited by the creativity of an organisation. They may
  include differences in colour, design, speed, style, taste, etc. For vacuum cleaners other
  companies may, for example, differentiate themselves on the basis of user convenience
  or design rather than suction performance. Product innovation and introduction can also
  be a basis of differentiation. Apple has been able to charge considerable premiums by
  continuously launching novel products with superior technologies, design and consumer
  interfaces; including the iPod, iPhone, iPad and Apple watch. Finally, in building a basis for
  differentiation it is vital to identify clearly the customer on whose needs the differentiation
  is based. This is not always straightforward; for example, it may be either an intermediate
  distributor or end customer (see Section 3.4.2).
• Customer relationships. Besides more tangible differences in product and service charac-
  teristics differentiation can rely on the relationship between the organisation providing
  the product and the customer. This often relates to how the product is perceived by
  the customer. The perceived value can increase through customer services and respon-
  siveness. This can include distribution services, payment services or after sales services,
  among other things. For example, Zalando, Europe’s leading online retailer for fashion
  and shoes, offers not only free shipping to the customer, but free returns and a ‘bill-me-
  later’ service. Products can also be differentiated for the individual customer through
  customisation. This is the case for a variety of consumer goods from athletic shoes to
  cars, but also for business-to-business goods like enterprise software. For example, the
  German software company SAP not only sells its standardised software packages, but
  customises these to meet specific customer needs. Finally, marketing and reputation,
  including emotional and psychological aspects, that an organisation projects can be
  another basis for differentiation. Starbucks, for example, can charge a premium price for
  its coffee not only because of its product differences, but also because of the ambiance
  and image that the company displays at its outlets. Building on brand image is common
  for products that otherwise are difficult to differentiate; this is a foundation for Coca
  Cola’s strategy for example.



                                                                                             209
Chapter 7 Business strategy and models


                   • Complements. Differentiation can also build on linkages to other products or services. The
                     perceived value of some products can be significantly enhanced when consumed together
                     with other product or service complements compared to consuming the product alone
                     (see Section 3.2.6). Apple has created the complement services iTunes and App Store free
                     of charge for the consumer, which differentiate its products (iPhone, iPad, etc.) with the
                     possibility to charge a premium. Considering how customers benefit from consuming two
                     products or services in tandem and a way of bundling products and services together to
                     increase the value for the customer is thus another way of differentiation.

                       There is an important condition for a successful differentiation strategy. Differentiation
                   allows higher prices, but usually this comes at a cost. To create valuable differentiation typic-
                   ally involves additional investments, for example in R&D, branding or staff quality. The differ-
                   entiator can expect that its costs will be higher than those of the average competitor. But,
                   as in the fourth column of Figure 7.4, the differentiator needs to ensure that the additional
                   costs of differentiation do not exceed the gains in price. It is easy to add on additional costs in
                   ways that are not valued sufficiently by customers. The historic failures under British owner-
                   ship of the luxury car companies Rolls-Royce and Bentley against top-end Mercedes cars are
                   partly attributable to the expensive crafting of wood and leather interiors, the full cost of
                   which even wealthy customers were not prepared to pay for. Just as cost-leaders should not
                   neglect quality, so should differentiators attend closely to costs, especially in areas irrelevant
                   to their sources of differentiation. Volvo’s differentiation strategy in the Indian bus market
                   in Illustration 7.2 also involved keeping an eye on costs besides differentiation.


                   7.2.3 Focus strategy
                   Porter distinguishes focus as the third generic strategy, based on competitive scope. A focus
                   strategy targets a narrow segment or domain of activity and tailors its products or services
                   to the needs of that specific segment to the exclusion of others. Focus strategies come in
                   two variants, according to the underlying sources of competitive advantage, cost or differen-
                   tiation. In air travel, Ryanair follows a cost focus strategy, targeting price-conscious travellers
                   with little need for connecting flights. In the domestic detergent market, the Belgian company
                   Ecover follows a differentiation focus strategy, gaining a price premium over rivals on account
                   of its ecological cleaning products targeted at environmental conscious customers.
                      The focuser achieves competitive advantage by dedicating itself to serving its target
                   segments better than others that are trying to cover a wider range of segments. Serving
                   a broad range of segments can bring disadvantages in terms of coordination, compromise
                   or inflexibility. Focus strategies are, therefore, able to seek out the weak spots of broad
                   cost-leaders and differentiators:

                   • Cost focusers identify areas where broader cost-based strategies fail because of the
                     added costs of trying to satisfy a wide range of needs. For instance, in the UK food retail
                     market, Iceland Foods has a cost-focused strategy concentrated on frozen and chilled
                     foods, reducing costs against discount food retailers with a wider product range and more
                     diverse suppliers which have all the complexity of fresh foods and groceries as well as their
                     own frozen and chilled food ranges.
                   • Differentiation focusers look for specific needs that broader differentiators do not serve
                     so well. Focus on one particular need helps to build specialist knowledge and technology,
                     increases commitment to service and can improve brand recognition and customer loyalty.
                     For example, ARM Holdings dominates the world market for smartphone and tablet chips
                     (see Illustration 10.4), despite being only a fraction of the size of the leading microprocessor
                     manufacturers, AMD and Intel, which also make chips for a wide range of computers.

                   Successful focus strategies depend on at least one of three key factors:

                   • Distinct segment needs. Focus strategies depend on the distinctiveness of segment needs. If
                     segment distinctiveness erodes, it becomes harder to defend the segment against broader
                     competitors. For example, Tesla Motors started to target a narrow segment with its expen-
                     sive premium electric vehicles. However, if the boundaries become blurred between Tesla’s
                     focus on electric cars used by affluent environmentally conscious consumers and electric
                     cars used by general consumers it could become easier for competitors to also attack this
                     distinctive niche.
                   • Distinct segment value chains. Focus strategies are strengthened if they have distinc-
                     tive value chains that will be difficult or costly for rivals to construct. If the production
                     processes and distribution channels are very similar, it is easy for a broad-based differen-
                     tiator to push a specialised product through its own standardised value chain at a lower
                     cost than a rival focuser. In detergents, Procter & Gamble cannot easily respond to the
                     Belgium ecologically friendly cleaning products company Ecover because achieving the
                     same environmental soundness would involve transforming its purchasing and produc-
                     tion processes.
                   • Viable segment economics. Segments can easily become too small to serve economically
                     as demand or supply conditions change.


                   7.2.4 Hybrid strategy
                   Porter warned that managers face a crucial choice between the generic strategies of cost
                   leadership, differentiation and focus. As earlier indicated, the lowest-cost competitor can
                   always undercut the second lowest-cost competitor. For a company seeking advantage
                   through low costs, therefore, it makes no sense to add extra costs by half-hearted efforts at
                   differentiation. For a differentiator, it is self-defeating to make economies that jeopardise
                   the basis for differentiation. For a focuser, it is dangerous to move outside the original
                   specialised segment, because products or services tailored to one set of customers are likely
                   to have inappropriate costs or features for the new target customers. Managers are gener-
                   ally best to consider the trade-offs and choose which generic strategy they are pursuing
                   and then stick to it. Otherwise there would be a danger of being stuck in the middle, doing
                   no strategy well.
                      However, it has been acknowledged that a hybrid type of strategy that combines
                   different generic strategies is possible under certain circumstances. For example, Amer-
                   ican Southwest Airlines pursues a low-cost strategy with their budget and no-frills offering.
                   However, its brand also signals differentiation based on convenience including frequent
                   departures and friendly service. Some companies start out with one strategy that is later
                   combined with another. McDonald’s first followed a product differentiation strategy, but
                   later its fast-food leader position allowed the company to emphasise scale and low costs
                   as well.
                      As Porter acknowledges, there may also be specific circumstances in which the strategies
                   can be combined:4

                   • Organisational separation. It is possible for a company to create separate strategic busi-
                     ness units (SBUs), each pursuing different generic strategies and with different cost
                     structures. The challenge, however, is to prevent negative spill-overs from one SBU to
                     another. For example, a company mostly pursuing differentiated strategies is liable
                     to have high head office costs that the low-cost SBUs will also have to bear. On the
                     other hand, a cheap cost-leader might damage the brand value of a sister SBU seeking
                     differentiation.

• Technological or managerial innovation. Sometimes technological innovations allow
  radical improvements in both cost and quality. Internet retailing reduces the costs of
  merchandise, at the same time as increasing differentiation by greater product range
  and, through online reviews, better advice.

   Hybrid strategies are, however, complex and should be pursued with caution. They require
careful considerations as the fundamental trade-off between low cost and differentiation
has to be resolved. Porter’s warning about the danger of being stuck in the middle provides
a useful discipline for managers. It is very easy for them to make incremental decisions that
compromise the basic generic strategy. As profits accumulate, the successful cost-leader will
be tempted to stop scrimping and saving. In hard times, a differentiator might easily cut
back the R&D or advertising investments essential to its long-term differentiation advantage.
Consistency with generic strategy provides a valuable check for managerial decision-making.
The next section provides a helpful tool in calibrating generic and hybrid strategies.


7.2.5 The Strategy Clock
The Strategy Clock is a tool that allows for a dynamic approach for examining alternative
generic strategies (see Figure 7.5) and gives more scope for hybrid strategies.5 The Strategy
Clock has two distinctive features. First, it is focused on prices to customers rather than costs
to the organisation: because prices are more visible than costs, the Strategy Clock can be
easier to use in comparing competitors. Second, the circular design of the clock allows for
more continuous choices than a sharp contrast between cost leadership and differentiation:
there is a full range of incremental adjustments that can be made between the 7 o’clock posi-
tion at the bottom of the low-price strategy and the 2 o’clock position at the bottom of the
differentiation strategy. Organisations may travel around the clock, as they explore different
directions for development and adjust their pricing and benefits over time.

Chapter 7 Business strategy and models


                      The Strategy Clock identifies three zones of feasible strategies, and one zone likely to lead
                   to ultimate failure:

                   • Differentiation (zone 1). This zone contains a range of feasible strategies for building on
                     high perceptions of product or service benefits among customers. Close to the 12 o’clock
                     position is a strategy of differentiation without price premium. Differentiation without a
                     price premium combines high-perceived benefits and moderate prices, typically used to
                     gain market share. If high benefits also entail relatively high costs, this moderate pricing
                     strategy would only be sustainable in the short term. Once increased market share has
                     been achieved, it might be logical to move to differentiation with price premium closer
                     to a 1 or 2 o’clock position. Movement all the way towards the 2 o’clock position is likely
                     to involve a focus strategy. Such a focused differentiation would target a particular niche
                     where the higher prices and reduced benefits would only be possible because of a lack
                     of competition, for instance in a particular geographical area.
                   • Low-price (zone 2). This zone allows for different combinations of low prices and low
                     perceived value. Close to the 9 o’clock position, a standard low-price strategy would gain
                     market share, by combining low prices with reasonable value (at parity with competitors).
                     To be sustainable, this strategy needs to be underpinned by some cost advantage, such as
                     economies of scale. Without such a cost advantage, cuts in benefits or increases in prices
                     become necessary eventually. A variation on the standard low-price strategy is the no-frills
                     strategy, close to the 7 o’clock position. No-frills strategies involve both low benefits and
                     low prices, similar to low-cost airlines such as Ryanair.
                   • Hybrid strategy (zone 3). A distinctive feature of the Strategy Clock is the space it allows
                     between low-price and differentiation strategies.6 Hybrid strategies involve both lower
                     prices than differentiation strategies, and higher benefits than low-price strategies. Hybrid
                     strategies are often used to make aggressive bids for increased market share. They can
                     also be an effective way of entering a new market, for instance overseas. Even in the case
                     of innovations with high benefits, it can make sense to price low initially in order to gain
                     experience curve efficiencies or lock-in through network effects (see Section 7.2.6). Some
                     companies sustain hybrid strategies over long periods of time: for example, furniture store
                     IKEA, which uses scale advantages to combine relatively low prices with differentiated
                     Scandinavian design (see end of chapter case).
                   • Non-competitive strategies (zone 4). The final set of strategies occupies a zone of unfea-
                     sible economics, with low benefits and high prices.

                   The Strategy Clock’s focus on price, and its scope for incremental adjustments in strategy,
                   provides a dynamic view of identifying a business strategy. However, Porter’s generic strat-
                   egies do remind managers that trade-offs and costs are critical. Unless an organisation has
                   some secure cost advantage (such as economies of scale), a hybrid strategy of high-perceived
                   benefits and low prices is unlikely to be sustainable for long unless competition pressures
                   are low.



7.3 Interactive strategies
                   Generic strategies need to be chosen, and adjusted, in the light of competitors’ strategies.
                   If everybody else is chasing after cost leadership, then a differentiation strategy might be
                   sensible. Thus business strategy choices interact with those of competitors. This section starts
                   by considering business strategy in the light of competitor moves, especially in hyper compe-
                   tition. It then addresses game theory more generally, which helps managers choose between
                   competition and more cooperative strategies.

                            7.3.1 Interactive price and quality strategies
                            Richard D’Aveni depicts competitor interactions in terms of movements against the variables
                            of price (the vertical axis) and perceived quality (the horizontal axis), similar to the Strategy
                            Clock: see Figure 7.6.7 Although D’Aveni applies his analysis to the very fast-moving environ-
                            ments he terms ‘hypercompetitive’ (see Section 3.3.1), similar reasoning applies wherever
                            competitors’ moves are interdependent.
                                Figure 7.6 shows different organisations competing by emphasising either low prices or
                            high quality or some mixture of the two. Graph (i) starts with a ‘first value line’, describing
                            various trade-offs in terms of price and perceived quality that are acceptable to customers.
                            The cost-leading firm (here L) offers relatively poor perceived quality, but customers accept
                            this because of the lower price. While the relative positions on the graph should not be
                            taken literally, in the car market this cost-leading position might describe some of Hyund-
                            ai’s products. The differentiator (D) has a higher price, but much better quality. This might
                            be Mercedes. In between, there is a range of perfectly acceptable combinations, with the
                            mid-point firm (M) offering a combination of reasonable prices and reasonable quality. This
                            might be Ford. M’s strategy is on the first value line and therefore entirely viable at this stage.
                            On the other hand, firm U is uncompetitive, falling behind the value line. Its price is higher
                            than M’s, and its quality is worse. U’s predicament is typical of the business that is ‘stuck in
                            the middle’, in Porter’s terms. U no longer offers acceptable value and must quickly move
                            back onto the value line or fail.
                                In any market, competitors and their moves or counter-moves can be plotted against
                            these two axes of price and perceived value. For example, in graph (i) of Figure 7.6, the differ-
                            entiator (D) makes an aggressive move by substantially improving its perceived quality while
                            holding its prices. This improvement in quality shifts customer expectations of quality right
                            across the market. These changed expectations are reflected by the new, second value line (in
                            green). With the second value line, even the cost-leader (L) may have to make some improve-
                            ment to quality, or accept a small price cut. But the greatest threat is for the mid-point
                            competitor, M. To catch up with the second value line, M must respond either by making a
                            substantial improvement in quality while holding prices, or by slashing prices, or by some
                            combination of the two.

                              However, mid-point competitor M also has the option of an aggressive counter-attack.
                          Given the necessary capabilities, M might choose to push the value line still further outwards,
                          wrong-footing differentiator D by creating a third value line that is even more demanding
                          in terms of the price-perceived quality trade-off. The starting point in graph (ii) of Figure 7.6
                          is all three competitors L, M and D successfully reaching the second value line (uncompet-
                          itive U has disappeared). However, M’s next move is to go beyond the second value line
                          by making radical cuts in price while sustaining its new level of perceived quality. Again,
                          customer expectations are changed and a third value line (in red) is established. Now it is
                          differentiator D that is at most risk of being left behind, and it faces hard choices about how
                          to respond in terms of price and quality.
                              Plotting moves and counter-moves in these terms underlines the dynamic and interactive
                          nature of business strategy. Economically viable positions along the value line are always
                          in danger of being superseded as competitors move either downwards in terms of price or
                          outwards in terms of perceived quality. The generic strategies of cost leadership and differ-
                          entiation should not be seen as static positions, but as dynamic trajectories along the axes
                          of price and quality.
                              A more detailed example of the sequence of decisions and possible options involved
                          in competitive interaction is given in Figure 7.7.8 This illustrates the situation of a business

facing a low-price competitor, for example a high-cost Western manufacturer facing possible
attack by cheap imports from Asia. There are three key decisions:

• Threat assessment. The first decision point is whether the threat is substantial or not.
  If there is a threat, the high-cost organisation should not automatically respond to
  a low-price competitor by trying to match prices: it is likely to lose a price war with its
  existing cost structure. The high-cost organisation needs a more sophisticated response.
• Differentiation response. If there are enough consumers prepared to pay for them, the
  high-cost organisation can seek out new points of differentiation. For example, a Western
  manufacturer may exploit its closeness to local markets by improving service levels. At the
  same time, unnecessary costs should be stripped out. If increased differentiation is not
  possible, then more radical cost solutions should be sought.
• Cost response. Merger with other high-cost organisations may help reduce costs and match
  prices through economies of scale. If a low-cost business is synergistic with (in other words,
  has benefits for) the existing business, this can be an effective platform for an aggressive
  cost-based counter-attack. If there is neither scope for further differentiation or synergy
  between the existing business and a possible new low-cost business, then the existing
  business must sooner or later be abandoned. For a Western manufacturer, one option
  might be to outsource all production to low-cost operators, simply applying its design
  and branding expertise. Another option would be to abandon manufacturing in favour
  of becoming a ‘solutions provider’, aggregating manufactured components from different
  suppliers and adding value through whole-systems design, consultancy or service.

Equivalent decisions would have to be made, of course, by a low-price competitor facing a
differentiator. When Apple entered the phone market with its expensive iPhone, established
handset manufacturers had first to decide whether Apple was a serious long-term threat,
and then choose how far they should either match the iPhone’s features or increase the price
differential between their products and Apple’s expensive ones.
   These kinds of moves and counter-moves are a constant feature of hypercompetitive
markets with continuous disequilibrium and change. In these conditions, it may no longer
be possible to plan for sustainable positions of competitive advantage and it may actually
destroy competitive advantage by slowing down response. Managers have to be able to act
faster than their competitors. ‘Thinking Differently’ at the end of this chapter highlights the
importance of transient rather than sustainable advantage.


7.3.2 Game theory
The competitive moves and counter-moves in the previous section make it clear that compe-
tition sometimes can escalate in a way that is dangerous to all competitors. It can be in the
self-interest of organisations to restrain competition and even to collaborate. Game theory
provides important insights into competitor interaction and when to compete and when to
cooperate.9 The ‘game’ refers to the kinds of interactive moves two players make in a game
of chess. Game theory encourages an organisation to consider competitors’ likely moves
and the implications of these moves for its own strategy. Game theorists are alert to two
kinds of interaction in particular. First, game theorists consider how a competitor response
to a strategic move might change the original assumptions behind that move: for example,
challenging a competitor in one area might lead to a counter-attack in another. Second,
game theorists are sensitive to the strategic signals, or messages, their moves might convey
to competitors, for example with regard to how fiercely they seem willing to defend their
position in a particular market. In the light of possible attacks and counter-attacks, game
theorists often advise a more cooperative approach than head-to-head competition.

Chapter 7 Business strategy and models


                      Game theory is particularly relevant where competitors are interdependent. Inter-
                   dependence exists where the outcome of choices made by one competitor is dependent
                   on the choices made by other competitors. For example, the success of price cuts by a
                   retailer depends on the responses of its rivals: if rivals do not match the price cuts, then the
                   price-cutter gains market share; but if rivals follow the price cuts, nobody gains market share
                   and all players suffer from the lower prices. Anticipating competitor counter-moves is clearly
                   vital to deciding whether to go forward with the price-cutting strategy.
                      There are two important guiding principles that arise from interdependence:

                   • Get in the mind of the competitors. Strategists need to put themselves in the position of
                     competitors, take a view about what competitors are likely to do and choose their own
                     strategy in this light. They need to understand their competitors’ game-plan to plan their
                     own.
                   • Think forwards and reason backwards. Strategists should choose their competitive moves
                     on the basis of understanding the likely responses of competitors. Think forwards to what
                     competitors might do in the future, and then reason backwards to what would be sensible
                     to do in the light of this now.

                       Game theory insights can be gained through two methods. On the one hand, war
                   gaming is helpful where it is important to get stakeholders to deeply appreciate each
                   other’s positions through actually playing out their respective roles, and where there is
                   uncertainty about the range of outcomes. Illustration 7.3 provides a public policy example
                   of war gaming and using game theory principles when changing and improving public-
                   sector services. On the other hand, mathematical game theory is useful where there is a
                   clear but limited range of outcomes and the values associated with each outcome can
                   be reasonably quantified.
                       One of the most famous illustrations of mathematical game theory is the prisoner’s
                   dilemma. Game theorists identify many situations where organisations’ strategic decisions
                   are similar to the dilemma of two prisoners accused of serial crimes together and being inter-
                   rogated in separate prison cells without the possibility of communicating with each other.
                   The prisoners have to decide on the relative merits of: (i) loyally supporting each other by
                   refusing to divulge any information to their interrogators; and (ii) seeking an advantage by
                   betraying the other. If both stay silent, they might get away with most of their crimes and
                   only suffer some lesser punishment, perhaps for just one or two offences. The interrogators,
                   though, will tempt each of them to divulge full information by offering them their freedom
                   if only they betray their fellow criminal. However, if both betray, then the judge is unlikely to
                   be grateful for the confessions and will punish them for all their crimes. The dilemma for each
                   of the prisoners is how much to trust in their mutual loyalty: if they both refuse to divulge,
                   they can both get away with the lesser punishment; on the other hand, if one is sure that
                   the other will not betray, it makes even more sense to betray the loyal one as that allows
                   the betrayer to go totally free. The two prisoners are clearly interdependent. But because
                   they cannot communicate, they each have to get in the mind of the other, think forwards to
                   what they might do, and then reason backwards in order to decide what their own strategy
                   should be – stay silent or betray.
                       The prisoner’s dilemma has its equivalence in business where there are two major players
                   competing head-to-head against each other in a situation of tight interdependence. This
                   is the position of Airbus and Boeing in the aircraft business or British Airways and Virgin
                   in transatlantic travel. It would be relevant to the strategic decisions of two such interde-
                   pendent companies in a range of situations: for example, if one company was thinking about
                   making a major investment in an innovative new product that the other company could

                   match. For two such competitors to communicate directly about their strategies in these
                   situations would likely be judged illegal by the competition authorities. They therefore have
                   to get into each other’s minds, think forwards and reason backwards. How will the other
                   company act or react, and, in the light of that, what strategy is best?
                       The kind of situation two interdependent competitors could get into is represented in the
                   prisoner’s dilemma matrix of Figure 7.8. Suppose the two main aircraft manufacturers Airbus
                   and Boeing were both under pricing pressure, perhaps because of falling demand. They each
                   have to decide whether to announce radical price cuts or to hold their prices up. If both
                   choose to hold their prices, neither gets an advantage over the other and they both get the
                   returns represented in the top left-hand quadrant of Figure 7.8: for the sake of illustration,
                   each might earn profits of €500m. However, if one competitor pursues the radical price cuts
                   on its own while the other does not, the pattern of returns might be quite different: the radical
                   price-cutter attracts a significantly larger share of airline customers and earns €700m profits
                   through spreading fixed costs over greater sales, while the market-share-losing competitor
                   earns only €100m (as represented in the top-right and bottom-left quadrants). This situation
                   might tempt one of the competitors to choose radical price cuts for two reasons: first, there
                   is the prospect of higher profits; but, second, there is the risk of the other competitor cutting
                   prices while leaving it behind. The problem is that if each reason in the same way, the two
                   competitors will both cut prices at once. They will thus set off a price war in which neither
                   gains share and they both end up with the unsatisfactory return of just €300m (the bottom-
                   right quadrant).
                       The dilemma in Figure 7.8 is awkward because cooperation is simultaneously attractive
                   and difficult to achieve. The most attractive strategy for Airbus and Boeing jointly is for
                   them both to hold their prices, yet in practice they are likely to cut prices because they must
                   expect the other to do so anyway. A distinctive feature of game theory is that it frequently
                   highlights the value of a more cooperative approach to competitor interaction, rather than
                   aggressive competition.
                       Collaboration between some organisations in a market may thus be preferred under
                   certain circumstances. Tacit collusion, where companies agree on a certain strategy without
                   any explicit communication between them, is thus not uncommon; for example, agreeing
                   to avoid price competition. It is facilitated by industries or sectors with few competitors,
                   homogenous products and high entry barriers. In short, while organisations need to avoid
                   illegal collusion, business strategy includes cooperative options as well as competitive ones.10
                   Game theory thus encourages managers to consider how a ‘game’ can be transformed from
                   lose–lose competition to win–win cooperation.

7.4 Business models
                      Business models have become increasingly popular as internet-based and platform companies
                      such as Airbnb, Spotify and Uber have conquered the world with their new models. They are
                      particularly useful when explaining more complex business interrelationships. Consequently,
                      the business model concept is commonly discussed in relation to strategy today. Building
                      on David Teece’s work this chapter carefully distinguishes business models from business
                      strategy.11 A business model describes a value proposition for customers and other partici-
                      pants, an arrangement of activities that produces this value, and associated revenue and
                      cost structures.12 Most fundamentally it concerns the manners and mechanisms of an organ-
                      isation’s value creation, configuration and capture. Competitors often have the same or similar
                      business models, but their business strategy and basis for competitive advantage can still differ.
                         When entrepreneurs in new start-ups have entered old industries with new business models
                      in recent years, they have frequently changed industry dynamics and competition in radical
                      ways. The new models often involve more complex interrelationships than traditional ones
                      and generate value and profits for more parties than just a buyer and seller. This shows that
                      both entrepreneurs and managers, whose organisations may be threatened by new start-ups,
                      need to understand business models. Illustration 7.4 discusses how Uber’s business model has
                      revolutionised the taxi industry globally. The remainder of this section first discusses three
                      fundamental elements of business models, some typical business model patterns and finishes
                      with an examination of a common business model: the multi-sided platform.


                      7.4.1 Value creation, configuration and capture
                      Business models describe business transactions and interrelationships between various
                      parties and are best explained in terms of three interrelated components (see Figure 7.9).13
                      The first emphasises value creation, a proposition that addresses a specific customer
                      segment’s needs and problems and those of other participants. The second component is
                      the value configuration of the resources and activities that produces this value. The final value
                      capture part explains revenue streams and cost structures that allow the organisation and
                      other stakeholders to gain a share of the total value generated.14

   The business model of the San Francisco-based accommodation broker Airbnb, for
example, creates value for both the customers that rent the apartment, house or private
room and for the hosts that offer their homes for rent. The Airbnb website conveniently
provides a platform for exchange activities between the hosts and guests. These activities
are configured via the web platform so that hosts list, describe and present pictures of their
homes and customers are thus offered a wide selection of accommodation to choose from
and rent. A review system of both accommodation and guests is available to build refer-
ences and prevent deception. Finally, both hosts and Airbnb capture value from this business
model. Hosts receive guest payments and Airbnb gets a 6–12 per cent commission fee on
guest reservations, a 3 per cent to process the payment to the host and guest credit card
processing fees. This points managers and entrepreneurs to three basic and interdependent
attributes of business models:

• Value creation. A key part of a business model describes what is offered and how value
  is thus created for the various parties involved: customers, partners and other partici-
  pants. The main concern here is thus the targeted customer segment and how their
  needs are fulfilled and their problems solved, but also how to create value for any other
  parties involved.
• Value configuration. A second component explains how various interdependent
  resources and activities in the value chain underlie the value proposition, for example
  technology, equipment, facilities, brands, managerial processes, etc. (for a discussion of
  the value chain see Section 4.4.3). These factors are part of an activity system that not
  only explains what activities create value, but how they are linked and what participants
  perform them (for activity systems see Section 4.4.3). While this system is centred on the
  organisation it can also involve activities conducted by customers, partners and other
  participants.15
• Value capture. A business model also describes the cost structure of resources and activities
  and the revenue stream from customers and any other parties. In addition, this compo-
  nent shows how the value created will be apportioned between the organisation and
  any other stakeholders involved. For a company, then, this last component also describes
  how profit is made while for not-for-profits and the public sector there are of course no
  expectations of financial gain.16

Two points need to be emphasised here:

• First, once established in an industry, business models are often taken for granted. All
  businesses rely on business models, but as they mature and become standardised they
  are rarely questioned. Until Airbnb and others started their services few thought about or
  challenged the ‘hotel business model’ and how value creation, configuration and capture
  were interrelated in this model. There may have been efforts to change individual busi-
  ness model components, but few changed or differentiated the whole model and the
  relationships between the components as Airbnb did. Business models thus often become
  institutionalised and part of an industry’s ‘recipe’ (see Section 6.3.2).
• Second, while competitors may share business models their business strategy can still
  differ. Walmart, for example, shares the same discount retailer model with several compet-
  itors, but has a distinct lowest-cost strategy; cutting costs systematically throughout its
  value chain. Likewise, Airbnb in the example above has the same business model as
  Wimdu and many other competitors. However, Airbnb’s extensive selection of accom-
  modation from close to one million listings in 34,000 cities in 200 countries surpasses any
  competitor and thus differentiates them. Because of this size both customers and hosts

Chapter 7 Business strategy and models


                      are likely to prefer Airbnb over competitors as guests are offered more accommodation
                      and hosts more guests. The more customers that use their service the better it is for every
                      customer in their network of guests and hosts and Airbnb thus has an advantage based
                      on network effects (see Section 3.2.6 for network effects).


                   7.4.2 Business model patterns
                   Even though business model patterns often become established within industries over time
                   companies use them competitively. New entrants often use new business models to be able
                   to compete successfully with established players. Dell, for example, entered the PC and laptop
                   industry many years ago based on a different business model compared to the established
                   one. Instead of going via middlemen of retailers and wholesalers as HP, IBM and others did,
                   they sold directly to customers. It is thus important for managers to understand what type of
                   business model pattern their business builds on and how it may differ from other competi-
                   tors. It should be noted, however, that business model patterns are described at various levels
                   of detail and sometimes only emphasise one or two business model components.17 There are
                   multiple business models around, but three typical patterns include the following:

                   • Razor and blade. This is perhaps the most well-known business model pattern, but its
                     primary focus is on the value capture component, which makes it more of a revenue model.
                     It builds on Gillette’s classic model of selling razors at a very low price and the compatible
                     replacement blades at a quite high price.18 This model of selling two technically interlinked
                     products separately is quite common. For example, mobile operators offering consumers a
                     cheap or even a free mobile phone and then catching them through a two-year fee-based
                     subscription plan. In other industries it is the services, maintenance and parts that are
                     priced expensively while the basic product is sold at relatively low margins. This is, for
                     example, the case for ink-jet printers; they are sold at relatively low prices, but manufac-
                     turers make their margins on selling expensive ink. It is also common in industrial goods
                     with an emphasis on expensive services; for example, Rolls Royce and GE and others in the
                     jet engine industry and for Otis and Schindler and other players in the elevator industry.
                   • Freemium. This business model pattern name comes from combining ‘free’ and ‘premium’
                     and it primarily relates to online businesses. It refers to how a basic version of a service or
                     product is offered for free so as to build a high volume of customers and eventually convince
                     a portion of the customers to buy a variety of premium services. Revenue is generated by
                     the premium buying customers. They are often only a small portion of the total user volume,
                     but their revenues can be enough and can also be used to attract even more users. The
                     photo sharing service Flickr uses this business model pattern. Flickr offers the basic service
                     of uploading and sharing photos for free while generating revenues through extra services
                     for a subscription fee including unlimited uploading and storing of photos. Flickr also uses
                     contextual advertising and cooperation with retail chains and other photo service companies
                     besides subscription fees to generate revenue. Other businesses that use this model are the
                     business-oriented social networking service LinkedIn, the video chat and voice call service
                     Skype and the streaming music service Spotify. The aim of freemium, however, is not only
                     to convince premium customers, but to attract a larger volume of customers as the value of
                     the service increases with more users. It means that the enterprise can gain network effects
                     based on a large installed base of adopters (see Section 3.2.6).
                   • Peer-to-peer (P2P). This model brings people and/or businesses together without neces-
                     sarily having to go through a middle man. It is based on co-operation among individuals
                     aided by an app, website or some other online or communication service and can include
                     all sorts of peer-to-peer transactions. Transactions include offerings of specific services

   like education, lending personal things that may be rarely used but expensive such as
   hobby-building tools, or providing loans peer to peer. An example of the latter is California-based
   Kiva, an international non-profit micro-finance website that aims to alleviate poverty by allowing
   everyday people in developed nations to finance low-income entrepreneurs and students in
   developing nations. This business model pattern has even been described as a potential new
   economic model, a sharing economy, as it is does not necessarily require a business interme-
   diary third party. However, business platform intermediaries often step in to make exchanges
   smoother. For example, within countless car-sharing organisations there are many local not-for-
   profit peer-to-peer intermediaries, but also global for-profit ones like Zipcar, owned by the US
   car rental multinational Avis. Airbnb is also a peer-to-peer model and so is Uber, but they
   build on for-profit platforms. This is often referred to as a ‘multi-sided platform’ business
   model, which is discussed in the next section.


7.4.3 Multi-sided platforms
Another common business model is the multi-sided platform,19 which is behind some of the
most valuable firms in the world. The so-called US ‘FAANG’ (Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix
and Google) and Chinese ‘BAT’ (Baidu, Alibaba and Tencent) companies all build on platforms.
A multi-sided platform brings together two or more distinct, but interdependent groups
of participants to interact on a platform. They are distinct as they perform separate functions
on the platform and they are interdependent as the platform is of value to each group of
participants only if the other group is also present. The platform YouTube, for example, includes
creators of videos, viewers of videos, and advertisers. A multi-sided platform comes in many
different shapes and can be a technology (e.g. Microsoft’s PC operating system), a product (e.g.
Nintendo’s video game console), or a service (Uber’s transportation service; see Illustration 7.4).
   Multi-sided platforms often overlap with other business model patterns, as at Airbnb for
instance with a peer-to-peer model or at Netflix, which primarily is a subscription model. Also,
platforms are not an entirely new phenomena; malls, for example, are platforms that allow
consumers and merchants to interact directly with each other and newspapers link subscribers
with advertisers. As indicated by the name there are several platform sides, most commonly
two, that perform different functions.20 Uber’s platform, for example, has car drivers on one
side and passengers on the other (see Illustration 7.4) and Nintendo has game developers one
side and gamers on the other: see Table 7.1 for further examples. In contrast, on a single-sided

Chapter 7 Business strategy and models


                   platform, like a telecommunication operator, all participants perform similar functions –
                   making or receiving calls. Over time platforms often introduce new types of interactions and
                   participants on the platform and thus new value creation. LinkedIn, for example, started out
                   by linking professionals to recruiters, but is now a three-sided platform including advertisers
                   and they have started to introduce corporations as a fourth side. Similarly, Amazon started as
                   an online book-seller and today is a truly multi-sided platform including not only other goods,
                   but various types of merchants, sellers and advertisers.
                      Network effects are intimately related to multi-sided platforms as the more participants,
                   the better for everyone on the platform. For video games console platforms, for example, the
                   gamers are on one side and favour consoles with a wide variety of games. This makes them
                   dependent on the other side of the platform, the game developers, which in turn favour plat-
                   forms with a large enough customer group to regain their development costs for the games.
                   This shows that the value of the platform increases for both groups as more customers or
                   gamers use it. It suggests a network effect as customers have a positive effect on the value of
                   the product or platform for other customers (see Section 3.2.3). Web search companies like
                   Google also rely on a similar pattern. For them the two sides of the platform involve consumer
                   searchers on the one hand and advertisers that sponsor links on the search website on the
                   other. The more searchers that use Google the better for advertisers and the better data for
                   Google to refine search results and the better quality of the searches the better for consumers.
                      There are three important factors to consider for platform companies:

                   • Platform distinctiveness and size. As with any product and service a platform must have
                     distinctive features in competition with other platforms to attract participants in the first
                     place. Quality and quantity of content and services, reliability, speed, ease of use, trust-
                     worthiness, etc. are all important factors, but the size of the platform’s network is also
                     essential. The total potential market size has to be sufficiently large to begin with to
                     make a platform valuable and network effects are crucial. This involves a chicken-and-egg
                     problem: the platform attracts participants by being large, but to become large it needs
                     to have enough participants. Besides offering superior services, one way to approach this
                     problem and reach a critical mass network is to subsidise one or all of the sides of the plat-
                     form. Uber, for example, often subsidises drivers when entering a new market. Another
                     approach, common among technology platforms, is to offer open source software pack-
                     ages and services to attract software and hardware developers to join the platform (see
                     Section 10.2.3 and Illustration 10.4). A third tactic is to piggy-back on another platform, like
                     US PayPal initially did on eBay.
                   • Choosing platform sides. Deciding what sides to include and how many is sometimes
                     obvious, as for Airbnb, but adding more sides may generate further growth and value
                     as further network effects kick in. However, adding new sides may introduce competi-
                     tion between the platform and a participant or between platform participants or harm
                     in other ways the relationship between participants. Amazon, for example, has other
                     merchants selling the same goods that they sell themselves on the platform and hence,
                     must carefully consider the balance between cooperation and competition. LinkedIn faces
                     a challenge when inviting corporate participants in, as professionals may not want their
                     current employers to be present when they may be searching for a new job. There is also a
                     risk that participants allowed on the platform try to build their own platform and migrate
                     users to it, like game producer Zynga tried to do with Facebook.21
                   • Multi-homing costs. A platform participant is ‘multi-homing’ when using more than one
                     platform at the same time. For example, music fans that stream, download, store and share
                     tunes on more than one music site are multi-homing. This may, however, incur transfer

                         costs for some platforms, like the inconvenience of transferring all photos from Instagram
                         to Flickr on image-hosting service platforms. Multi-homing costs are thus costs of being
                         affiliated with and maintaining presence on multiple platforms.22 Platform companies aim
                         for high multi-homing costs for platform participants to keep them generating value on
                         their platform rather than on competing ones. It can thus be quite costly for participants
                         to use multiple platforms. Besides costs of finding and joining more than one there may be
                         costs for additional competences to operate on another platform and the time and effort it
                         takes to use multiple platforms may also incur costs. For example, it’s very expensive for an
                         app and software developer to build simultaneously for both Apple and Android. There are
                         also user switching costs of permanently leaving one platform for another. For example, for
                         users to move from an Android to an iPhone smartphone platform there are transferring
                         costs of moving apps, contacts, messages, files, etc. besides learning a different operating
                         system. The size of multi-homing costs differs between platforms. Facebook, for example,
                         has quite high multi-homing costs for users as transferring all data is extremely cumbersome,
                         but Uber has very low multi-homing costs. A taxi driver can exist simultaneously on Uber, Lyft
                         or any other service; she or he can even have two or multiple phones on at the same time,
                         and riders can clearly switch.

                     Summary
                     • Business strategy is concerned with seeking competitive advantage in markets at the busi-
                       ness rather than corporate level.
                     • Porter’s generic strategy framework and the Strategy Clock define various business strat-
                       egies, including cost-leadership, differentiation, focus and hybrid strategies.
                     • In hypercompetitive conditions sustainable competitive advantage is difficult to achieve
                       and competitors need to carefully consider moves and counter-moves.
                     • Game theory encourages managers to get in the mind of competitors and think forwards
                       and reason backwards about competitive as well as cooperative strategies.
                     • A business model describes the business logic of an enterprise including the domains of
                       value creation, value configuration and value capture.
                     • Multi-sided platforms bring together two or more distinct, but interdependent groups of
                       participants to create value on a platform.

8.1 Introduction
          Chapter 7 was concerned with competitive strategy – the ways in which a single business unit
          or organisational unit can compete in a given market space, for instance through cost leader-
          ship or differentiation. However organisations may choose to enter many new product and
          market areas (see Figure PII.1 in Part II introduction). For example Tata Group, one of India’s
          largest companies, began as a trading organisation and soon moved into hotels and textiles.
          Since that time Tata has diversified further into steel, motors, consultancy, technologies, tea,
          chemicals, power, communications. As organisations add new units and capabilities, their
          strategies may no longer be solely concerned with competitive strategy in one market space
          at the business level, but with choices concerning different businesses or markets. Corporate
          strategy is about the overall scope of the organisation and how value is added to the
          constituent businesses of the organisation as a whole. Choices about business areas, indus-
          tries and geographies to be active in will determine the direction(s) an organisation might
          pursue for growth, which business unit(s) to buy and dispose of, and how resources may
          be allocated efficiently across multiple business activities. For Tata, the corporate strategy
          questions are whether it should enter any more industries, whether it should exit some, and
          how far it should integrate the businesses it retains. For large public-sector organisations and
          charities these choices also have to be made. These choices, indicated in Figure 8.1, inform
          decisions about how broad an organisation should be. This ‘scope’ of an organisation is
          central to corporate strategy and the focus of this chapter.
              Scope is concerned with how far an organisation should be diversified in terms of two
          different dimensions: products and markets. As the Tata example shows, an organisation may
          increase its scope by engaging in industries different to its current ones. Section 8.2 intro-
          duces a classic product market framework that uses these categories for identifying different
          growth directions for an organisation. This indicates different diversification strategies open
          to an organisation, according to the novelty of products or markets. Underpinning diversifi-
          cation choices are a range of drivers, which are discussed in Section 8.3, including increasing
          market power, reducing risk and exploiting superior internal processes. The performance
          implications of diversification are, then, reviewed in Section 8.4.
              Another way of increasing the scope of an organisation is vertical integration, discussed
          in Section 8.5. It allows an organisation to act as an internal supplier or a customer to itself
          (as for example an oil company supplies its petrol to its own petrol stations). Alternatively
          the organisation may decide to outsource certain activities – to ‘dis-integrate’ by subcon-
          tracting an internal activity to an external supplier – or divest as both may improve organisa-
          tional focus and efficiency. The scope of the organisation may therefore be adjusted through
          growth or contraction.
              Diversified corporations that operate in different areas of activity will have multiple SBUs
          (strategic business units) with their own strategies for their specific markets. They can be held
          accountable for their success or failure. Nevertheless, corporate head office, the ‘corporate
          level’, needs to select an appropriate portfolio of individual SBUs and manage them by estab-
          lishing their boundaries, perhaps by market, geography or capability, so they add value to the
          group.1 The value-adding effect of head office to individual SBUs that make up the organ-
          isation’s portfolio is termed parenting advantage (see Section 8.6). Their ability to do this
          effectively may give them a competitive advantage over other corporate parents in acquiring
          and managing different businesses. The importance of parenting is underlined by a recent
          study that found a SBU’s corporate parent accounts for more financial performance than the
          industry in which the SBU competes.2 But just how do corporate-level activities, decisions and
          resources add value to businesses? As will be seen at the end of the chapter in the ‘Thinking
          Differently’ section, some are sceptical about headquarters’ ability to add value.

                       In order to decide which industries and businesses organisations should invest in or
                   dispose of, the corporate centre needs to assess whether the portfolio of businesses is
                   worth more under its management than the individual businesses would be worth standing
                   alone. Section 8.7 reviews portfolio matrices, which are useful techniques to help structure
                   corporate-level choices about businesses in which to invest and those to divest.
                       This chapter is not just about large commercial businesses. Small businesses may also have
                   different business units. For example, a local building company may be undertaking contract
                   work for local government, industrial buyers and local homeowners. Not only are these
                   different market segments, but the mode of operation and capabilities required for compet-
                   itive success in each are also likely to be different. Moreover, the owner of that business has
                   to take decisions about the extent of investment and activity in each segment. Public-sector
                   organisations such as local government or health services also provide different services,
                   which correspond to business units in commercial organisations. Corporate-level strategy is
                   also highly relevant to the appropriate drawing of organisational boundaries in the public
                   sector. Privatisation and outsourcing decisions can be considered as responses to the failure
                   of public-sector organisations to add sufficient value by their parenting.



8.2 Strategy directions
                   A central corporate strategy choice is the direction in which a company should grow. Ansoff’s
                   classic corporate strategy matrix 3 (Figure 8.2) suggests four basic directions for organisational
                   growth. Typically an organisation starts in zone A and may choose between penetrating still
                   further within zone A or increasing its diversity along the two axes of increasing novelty of
                   markets or products. Increasing the diversity of products and/or markets is known as ‘diver-
                   sification’. Diversification involves increasing the range of products or markets served
                   by an organisation. Related diversification involves expanding into products or services
                   with relationships to the existing business. Thus in Ansoff’s matrix the organisation has two
                   related diversification strategies available: moving to zone B, product/service development
                   for its existing markets or moving to zone C by taking its existing products into new markets.
                   In each case, the further along the two axes, the more diversified the strategy. Alternatively,

Source: Adapted from H.I. Ansoff, Corporate Strategy, Penguin, 1988, Chapter 6. Ansoff orignally had a matrix with four
separate boxes, but in practice strategic directions involve more continuous axes. The Ansoff matrix itself was later
developed – see reference 1.



the organisation can move in both directions at once, following a diversification strategy with
altogether new markets and new products/services (zone D). Thus unrelated diversification
involves moving into products or services with no relationships to existing businesses.
   Ansoff’s axes can be used for brainstorming strategic options, checking that all four zones
have been properly considered. Illustration 8.1 traces the evolution of giant supermarket
Tesco, raising questions about how businesses might choose their next strategic direction.
The next section will consider each of Ansoff’s four main directions in detail.


8.2.1 Market penetration
For a simple, undiversified business, the most obvious strategic option is often increased
penetration of its existing market, with its existing products. Market penetration implies
increasing share of current markets with the current product or service range. This
strategy builds on established capabilities and does not require the organisation to venture
into uncharted territory. The organisation’s scope is exactly the same. Moreover, greater
market share implies increased power vis-à-vis buyers and suppliers (in terms of Porter’s five
forces), greater economies of scale and experience curve benefits.
   However, organisations seeking greater market penetration may face three constraints:

• Retaliation from competitors. In terms of the five forces (Section 3.2), increasing market pene-
  tration is likely to exacerbate industry rivalry as other competitors in the market defend their
  share. Increased rivalry might involve price wars or expensive marketing battles, which may
  cost more than any market-share gains are actually worth. The dangers of provoking fierce
  retaliation are greater in low-growth markets, as gains in volume will be more at the expense
  of other players. Where retaliation is a danger, organisations seeking market penetration
  need resources and capabilities that give a clear competitive advantage. In low-growth or
  declining markets, it can be more effective simply to acquire competitors. Some companies
  have grown quickly in this way. For example, in the steel industry the Indian company LNM
  (Mittal) moved rapidly in the 2000s to become the largest steel producer in the world by
  acquiring struggling steel companies around the world. Acquisitions may reduce rivalry, by
  taking out independent players and controlling them under one umbrella.

• Legal constraints. Greater market penetration can raise concerns from official competition
  regulators concerning excessive market power. Most countries have regulators with the
  powers to restrain powerful companies or prevent mergers and acquisitions that would
  create such excessive power. In the United Kingdom, the Competition Commission can
  investigate any merger or acquisition that would account for more than 25 per cent of the
  national market, and either halt the deal or propose measures that would reduce market
  power. The European Commission has an overview of the whole European market and
  can similarly intervene. For example, it approved a merger between Ziggo and Liberty
  Global, two separate cable TV operators providing mainly fixed telecommunications
  services in The Netherlands. However the Commission was concerned that removing two
  close competitors would hinder competition in the Dutch market for wholesale premium
  Pay TV. To maintain effective competition Liberty Global had to divest its Film1 channel,
  and so sold it to Sony.4
• Economic constraints. Market penetration may also not be an option where economic
  constraints are severe, for instance during a market downturn or public-sector funding
  crisis. Here organisations will need to consider the strategic option of retrenchment: with-
  drawal from marginal activities in order to concentrate on the most valuable segments
  and products within their existing business. However, where growth is still sought after,
  the Ansoff axes suggest further directions, as follows.



8.2.2 Product and service development
Product and service development is where organisations deliver modified or new prod-
ucts (or services) to existing markets. This can involve varying degrees of diversification
along the horizontal axis of Figure 8.2. For Apple, developing its products from iPhone to
iPad to Apple Watch involved little diversification: although the technologies differed, Apple
was targeting the same customers and using very similar production processes and distribu-
tion channels. Despite the potential for benefits from relatedness, product development can
be an expensive and high-risk activity for at least two reasons:

• New resources and capabilities. Product development strategies typically involve mastering
  new processes or technologies that are unfamiliar to the organisation. For example, the
  digital revolution is forcing universities to reconsider the way learning materials are
  acquired and provided to students and the nature of the student/academic interface.
  High-quality content available free online and virtual engagement with students now
  raise the question of how universities should add new digital products and how they
  should consider redeploying their resources in the future. Success is likely to depend on a
  willingness to acquire new technological capabilities, to engage in organisational restruc-
  turing and new marketing capabilities to manage customer perceptions. Thus product
  development typically involves heavy investments and can have high risk of project
  failures.
• Project management risk. Even within fairly familiar domains, product development pro-
  jects are typically subject to the risk of delays and increased costs as extension of current
  strategy focus often leads to growing project complexity and changing project specifica-
  tions over time. For example, the UK’s high-speed rail project, HS2, was originally projected
  to cost £32.7bn in 2010, estimated to cost £56bn in 2018 and now commentators are
  suggesting it will end up costing between 20 per cent and 60 per cent more than that,
  making it the world’s most expensive railway.

Strategies for product development are considered further in Chapter 10.



                                                                                           241
Chapter 8 Corporate strategy


                   8.2.3 Market development
                   Market development can be more attractive than product/service development by being
                   potentially cheaper and quicker to execute. Market development involves offering existing
                   products/services to new markets. Again, the degree of diversification varies along
                   Figure 8.2’s downward axis. Typically, of course, market development entails some product
                   development as well, if only in terms of packaging or service. Nonetheless, market develop-
                   ment remains a form of related diversification given its origins in similar products. Market
                   development takes two basic forms:

                   • New users. Here an example would be aluminium, whose original users, packaging and
                     cutlery manufacturers are now supplemented by users in aerospace and automobiles.
                   • New geographies. The prime example of this is internationalisation but it would also
                     include the spread of a small retailer into new towns.

                   In all cases, it is essential that market development strategies be based on products or
                   services that meet the critical success factors of the new market (see Section 3.4.3). Strategies
                   based on simply offloading traditional products or services in new markets are likely to fail.
                   Moreover, market development faces similar problems to product development. In terms
                   of capabilities, market developers often lack the right marketing skills and brands to make
                   progress in a market with unfamiliar customers. On the management side, the challenge is
                   coordinating between different users and geographies, which might all have different needs.
                   International market development strategy is considered in Chapter 9.


                   8.2.4 Unrelated diversification
                   Whereas related diversification takes the organisation beyond existing markets and its
                   existing products (i.e. into zones B and C in Figure 8.2), where operational links remain with
                   the core business, unrelated diversification is when an organisation expands into markets,
                   products and services completely different from its own (i.e. zone D in Figure 8.2). Here
                   value can be created at the strategic level as businesses may benefit from being part of a
                   larger group: consumers may have greater confidence in the business unit’s products and
                   services than before and a larger organisation can reduce the costs of finance.
                       It is important to note that the distinction between related and unrelated diversification is
                   often a matter of degree as relationships that might have seemed valuable in related diver-
                   sification may not turn out to be as valuable as expected. Thus the large accounting firms
                   have often struggled in translating their skills and client contacts developed in auditing into
                   effective consulting practices. Similarly, relationships may change in importance over time,
                   as the nature of technologies or markets changes: see, for example, the decision by TomTom
                   to move into different product offerings (Illustration 8.2).
                       An extreme form of unrelated diversification is conglomerate diversification, where there
                   are no operational or strategic linkages between multiple business, as each remains on its
                   own. The logic of conglomerate diversification is a financial one of balancing a portfolio of
                   investments. Such conglomerate strategies are often not trusted by many observers because
                   there are no obvious ways in which the businesses can work together to generate additional
                   value, over and above the businesses remaining on their own. In addition, there is often an
                   additional bureaucratic cost of the managers at headquarters who control them. For this
                   reason, conglomerate companies’ share prices can suffer from what is called the ‘conglom-
                   erate discount’ – in other words, a lower valuation than the combined individual constituent
                   businesses would have on their own.

8.3 Diversification drivers
                   Diversification might be chosen for a variety of reasons, including response to macro-
                   competitive changes and managerial ambitions,5 with some more value-creating than others.6
                   Growth in organisational size is rarely a good enough reason for diversification on its own:
                   growth must be profitable. Indeed, growth can often be merely a form of ‘empire building’,
                   especially in the public sector. Diversification decisions need to be approached sceptically.
                      Four potentially value-creating drivers for diversification are as follows.

                   • Exploiting economies of scope. Economies of scope refer to efficiency gains through
                     applying the organisation’s existing resources or capabilities to new markets or services.7 If
                     an organisation has under-utilised resources or capabilities that it cannot effectively close or
                     sell to other potential users, it is efficient to use these resources or capabilities by diversifica-
                     tion into a new activity. In other words, there are economies to be gained by extending the
                     scope of the organisation’s activities. For example, many universities have large resources in
                     terms of halls of residence, which they must have for their students but which are under-uti-
                     lised out of term-time. These halls of residence are more efficiently used if the universities
                     expand the scope of their activities into conferencing and tourism during holiday periods.
                     Economies of scope may apply to both tangible resources, such as halls of residence, and
                     intangible resources and competences, such as brands or staff skills.
                   • Stretching corporate management capabilities (‘dominant logics’). This is a special case of econ-
                     omies of scope, and refers to the potential for applying the skills of talented corporate-level
                     managers (referred to as ‘corporate parenting skills’ in Section 8.6) to new businesses. The
                     dominant logic is the set of corporate-level managerial capabilities applied across the
                     portfolio of businesses.8 Corporate-level managers may have capabilities that can be
                     applied even to businesses not sharing resources at the operating-unit level.9 Thus the French
                     luxury-goods conglomerate LVMH includes a wide range of businesses – from champagne,
                     through fashion, jewellery and perfumes, to financial media – that share very few opera-
                     tional resources or business-level capabilities. However, LVMH creates value for these special-
                     ised companies by applying corporate-level competences in developing classic brands and
                     nurturing highly creative people that are relevant to all its individual businesses. See also the
                     discussion of dominant logic at Berkshire Hathaway in Illustration 8.4 later.
                      • Exploiting superior internal processes:
                      • Internal processes within a diversified corporation can be more efficient than external
                        processes in the open market.
                      • In emerging markets, where markets for capital and labour do not work so well and
                        where there is a lack of market and competitive pressures, conglomerates may work
                        when regional growth rates are between 5 per cent and 15 per cent. For example,
                        China has many conglomerates because they are able to mobilise internal investment,
                        develop managers and exploit networks in a way that standalone Chinese companies,
                        relying on imperfect markets, cannot. For example, China’s largest privately owned
                        conglomerate, the Fosun Group, owns steel mills, pharmaceutical companies and
                        China’s largest retailer, Yuyuan Tourist Mart.10
                   • Increasing market power.11 Being diversified in many businesses can increase power
                     vis-à-vis competitors in at least two ways. First, having the same wide portfolio of prod-
                     ucts as a competitor increases the potential for mutual forbearance. The ability to retaliate
                     across the whole range of the portfolio acts to discourage the competitor from making
                     any aggressive moves at all. Two similarly diversified competitors are thus likely to forbear
                     from competing aggressively with each other. Second, having a diversified range of busi-
                     nesses increases the power to cross-subsidise one business from the profits of the others.

            The ability to cross-subsidise can support aggressive bids to drive competitors out of a
            particular market and, being aware of this, competitors without equivalent power will
            be reluctant to attack that business.
          Where diversification creates value, it is described as ‘synergistic’.12 Synergies are benefits
          gained where activities or assets complement each other so that their combined effect is
          greater than the sum of the parts (the famous 2 + 2 = 5 equation). Thus a film company and
          a music publisher would be synergistic if they were worth more together than separately – if
          the music publisher had the sole rights to music used in the film company productions for
          instance. However, synergies are often harder to identify and more costly to extract in prac-
          tice than managers like to admit.13
             Indeed, some drivers for diversification involve negative synergies, in other words value
          destruction. Three potentially value-destroying diversification drivers are:
          • Responding to market decline is one common but doubtful driver for diversification.
            Rather than let the managers of a declining business invest spare funds in a new busi-
            ness, conventional finance theory suggests it is usually best to let shareholders find new
            growth investment opportunities for themselves. For example, Kodak (Illustration 6.4
            in Chapter 6), the US photo film corporation, spent billions of dollars on diversification
            acquisitions such as chemicals, photocopiers and telecommunications in order to compen-
            sate for market decline in its main product. Many of these initiatives failed and Kodak
            went bankrupt. Shareholders might have preferred Kodak simply to hand back the large
            surpluses generated for decades beforehand rather than spending on costly acquisitions.
            If shareholders had wanted to invest in the chemicals, telecommunications or photo-
            copiers, they could have invested in the original companies themselves.
          • Spreading risk across a range of markets is another common justification for diversifica-
            tion. Again, conventional finance theory is very sceptical about risk-spreading by diversi-
            fication. Shareholders can easily spread their risk by taking small stakes in dozens of very
            different companies themselves. Diversification strategies, on the other hand, are likely to
            involve a limited range of fairly related markets. While managers might like the security of
            having more than one market, shareholders typically do not need each of the companies
            they invest in to be diversified as well – they would prefer managers to concentrate on
            managing their core business as well as they can. However, conventional finance theory
            does not apply to private businesses, where owners have a large proportion of their assets
            tied up in their company: here it can make sense to diversify risk across a number of
            distinct activities, so that if one part is in trouble, the whole business is not pulled down.
          • Managerial ambition can sometimes drive inappropriate diversification. For example, Vĳay
            Mallya, CEO of UB Group, an Indian conglomerate involved in alcoholic beverages, aviation
            infrastructure, real estate and fertiliser, diversified further into airlines with Kingfisher
            Airlines. This seemed in keeping with his extravagant lifestyle and pursuit of glamour;
            fitting his reputation as ‘the King of Good Times’. However there were no obvious syner-
            gies, and the airline industry was not competitive – leading to the collapse of Kingfisher
            and the loss of other key group assets. Managers such as Mallya might gain short-term
            benefits in terms of prestige and financial rewards from diversification, but going beyond
            his areas of true expertise soon brought financial disaster.


8.4 Diversification and performance
          Because most large corporations today are diversified, but also because diversification
          can sometimes be in management’s self-interest, many scholars and policy-makers have
          been concerned to establish whether diversified companies really perform better than

                                                                                                      245

                   undiversified companies. After all, it would be deeply troubling if large corporations were
                   diversifying simply to spread risk for managers, to save managerial jobs in declining busi-
                   nesses or to generate short-term benefits for managers.
                      Research studies of diversification have particularly focused on the relative benefits of
                   related diversification, unrelated and conglomerate diversification. Researchers gener-
                   ally find that related or limited diversifiers outperform both firms that remain specialised
                   and those that have unrelated or extensively diversified strategies.14 In other words, the
                   diversification–performance relationship tends to follow an inverted (or upside-down)
                   U-shape, as in Figure 8.3. The implications of this finding have been that companies have
                   tended to pursue lower levels of unrelated diversification over time and recent research now
                   suggests that the average performance outcomes for unrelated diversifiers are improved,
                   thus smoothing the curve in Figure 8.3.15 The implication is that some diversification is
                   good – but not too much.
                      However, these performance studies produce statistical averages. Some related diversifi-
                   cation strategies fail – as in the case of some accounting firms’ ventures in consulting – while
                   some conglomerates succeed – as in the case of luxury goods conglomerate LVMH. The
                   case against unrelated diversification is not solid, and effective dominant logics or particular
                   national contexts can play in its favour. For instance, easyGroup with interests including
                   planes, pizza, cars and gyms has a strong dominant logic around business model innovation
                   in mature industries. In terms of national contexts, conglomerate diversification may work
                   where internal processes are superior to imperfect markets and institutional weaknesses
                   such as poor law enforcement, lack of quality labour and capricious political contexts. The
                   conclusion from the performance studies is that, although on average related diversification
                   pays better than unrelated, any diversification strategy needs to be mindful of context and
                   be subject to rigorous questioning on its particular merits.



8.5 Vertical integration
                   Another form of diversification, and another direction for corporate strategy is vertical inte-
                   gration. Vertical integration describes entering activities where the organisation is its
                   own supplier or customer. Thus it involves operating at another stage of the value network

246
                                                                           8.5 Vertical integration


(see Section 4.4.2). This section considers both vertical integration and vertical dis-integration,
particularly in the form of outsourcing.


8.5.1 Forward and backward integration
Vertical integration can go in either of two directions:

• Backward integration is movement into input activities concerned with the company’s
  current business (i.e. further back in the value system). For example, acquiring a compo-
  nent supplier would be backward integration for a car manufacturer.
• Forward integration is movement into output activities concerned with the company’s
  current business (i.e. further forward in the value network). For a car manufacturer,
  forward integration would be into car retail, repairs and servicing.

Thus vertical integration, like other forms of diversification, increases corporate scope. The
difference is that it brings together activities up and down the same value network, while
diversification typically involves more or less different value networks. However, because real-
ising synergies involves bringing together different value networks, diversification (especially
related diversification) is sometimes also described as horizontal integration. For example,
a company diversified in cars, trucks and buses could find benefits in integrating aspects of
the various design or component-sourcing processes. The relationship between horizontal
integration and vertical integration is depicted in Figure 8.4.
    Vertical integration often appears attractive as it seems to ‘capture’ some of the profits
gained by retailers or suppliers in a value network – the retailers’ or suppliers’ profits. However
there are two dangers. First, vertical integration involves investment. Expensive investments
in activities that are less profitable than the original core business will be unattractive to
shareholders because they are reducing their average or overall rate of return on invest-
ment. Second, even if there is a degree of relatedness through the value network, vertical
integration is likely to involve quite different resources and capabilities. Thus car manufac-
turers forwardly integrating into car servicing found managing networks of small service
outlets very different to managing large manufacturing plants. Growing appreciation of
both the risks of diluting overall returns on investment and the distinct capabilities involved
at different stages of the value network has led many companies in recent years to vertically
dis-integrate.


8.5.2 To integrate or to outsource?
Where a part of vertically integrated operations is not adding value to the overall business,
or a partner organisation can manage it better, it may be replaced through outsourcing
or subcontracting. Outsourcing is the process by which value chain activities previously
carried out internally are subcontracted to external suppliers. In other words the organisa-
tion continues to offer its products and services based on external inputs instead of providing
those in-house (see Illustration 8.3). The argument for outsourcing to suppliers is often based
on their unique capabilities that allow lower costs to the sourcing organisation. Suppliers
may have lower wages, scale economies, expertise, more professional employees and better
incentives. Suppliers may have access to better technology and may be be more effective
than the sourcing organisation. Outsourcing may also allow the organisation to be more
flexible in reducing the size of its balance sheet and allowing it to adjust to market demand.
Specialists in a particular activity are therefore likely to have superior capabilities than an
organisation for a particular activity not central to its business. A specialist IT contractor is
usually better at IT than the IT department of a healthcare company.

                      However, Nobel prize-winning economist Oliver Williamson has argued that the decision
                   to integrate or outsource involves more than just relative capabilities. His transaction cost
                   framework helps analyse the relative costs and benefits of managing (‘transacting’) activities
                   internally or externally.16 Assessing whether to integrate or outsource an activity, Williamson
                   warns against underestimating the long-term costs of opportunism by external subcontrac-
                   tors. Subcontractors are liable over time to take advantage of their position, either to reduce
                   their standards or to extract higher prices. Market relationships tend to fail in controlling
                   subcontractor opportunism where:

                   • there are few alternatives to the subcontractor and it is hard to shop around;
                   • the product or service is complex and changing, and therefore impossible to specify fully
                     in a legally binding contract;
                   • investments have been made in specific assets, which the subcontractors know will have
                     little value if they withhold their product or service.

                       This transaction cost framework suggests that the costs of opportunism can outweigh
                   the benefits of subcontracting to organisations with superior resources and capabilities. For
                   example, mining companies in isolated parts of the Australian outback typically own and
                   operate housing for their workers. The isolation creates specific assets (the housing is worth
                   nothing if the mine closes down) and a lack of alternatives (the nearest town might be a
                   hundred miles away). Consequently, there would be large risks to both partners if the mine
                   subcontracted housing to an independent company specialising in worker accommodation,
                   however strong its capabilities. Transaction cost economics therefore offers the following
                   advice: if there are few alternative suppliers, if activities are complex and likely to change, and
                   if there are significant investments in specific assets, then it is likely to be better to vertically
                   integrate rather than outsource.
                       In sum, the decision to integrate or subcontract rests on the balance between:

                   • Relative resources and capabilities. Does the subcontractor have the potential to do the
                     work significantly better?
                   • Risk of opportunism. Is the subcontractor likely to take advantage of the relationship over time?

                   8.5.3 Divestment

                   • Divestment occurs when the organisation decides to pull out of out one or more of its
                     businesses. This often occurs with unrelated diversified businesses, SBUs with poor oper-
                     ating performance, poor stock market performance, external pressures such as activists and
                     the arrival of a new CEO. Well-known shareholder activists include Carl Icahn, Nelson Peltz,
                     Daniel Loeb and Bill Ackman. Estimates vary but some say that as many as 1,000 companies
                     were subjected to activist demands during 2018. Divestment allows the parent to reduce the
                     scope of its portfolio of businesses and this can raise the overall value of the organisation.
                   • The decision to divest may occur if the SBU in question is not adding value to the firm and
                     the price obtained through sell-off is more than it standalone value. But before divestment
                     happens it is important to consider whether the business might be restructured in such a
                     way that its contribution to the group could be improved. Also it is important to consider
                     if there are interdependencies with other SBUs where divestment might damage a SBU
                     that is retained. Divestment should also be considered for SBUs that are adding value to
                     the group but a better corporate parent can be found, provided that a really good price
                     can be obtained and other synergies within the organisation are not damaged.

                   There are two main types of divestment i) sell-off and ii) spin-off.

                   • In a sell-off the SBU is sold to another company. If the acquirer uses a lot of debt to buy
                     the sell-off this is termed a leveraged buy-out (LBO) and if the SBU management team
                     raises finance to buy the business it is a management buy-out (MBO).
                   • In a spin-off, the shares of the SBU are distributed to parent organisation shareholders
                     and the business is listed on the stock exchange.
                   • The parent organisation may not want to be rid of the SBU entirely and may therefore prefer
                     an iii) equity carve out. Here the organisation sells a portion of SBU shares to the public in an
                     initial public offering (IPO) and retains a significant amount of shares for itself so they can
                     keep control. Generally this is a temporary arrangement but it has advantages of establishing
                     a market price that the organisation can use to negotiate a full sell-off, and, if it occurs before
                     a spin-off, it generates cash. Figure 8.5 shows a decision tree for a divestment decision.

8.6 Value creation and the corporate parent
          Sometimes corporate parents do not add value to their constituent businesses. Where there is
          no added value, or where there may be a better parent, it is usually best to divest the relevant
          businesses from the corporate portfolio. Thus in 2017 Swedish engineering group Sandvik
          carried out a portfolio review and divested its loss making Mining Systems, its welding wire
          business and then sold advanced wear resistant tools SBU, Hyperion, to KKR for SEK 4bn in
          order to focus on its core business. In the public sector too, units such as schools or hospitals
          are increasingly being given freedom from parenting authorities, because independence is
          seen as more effective. Some theorists even challenge the notion of corporate-level strategy
          altogether (see Thinking Differently at the end of the chapter). The following section exam-
          ines how corporate parents can both add and destroy value, and considers three different
          parenting approaches that can be effective.


          8.6.1 Value-adding and value-destroying activities
          of corporate parents17
          Corporate parents need to demonstrate that they create more value than they cost. This
          applies to both commercial and public-sector organisations. For public-sector organisations,
          privatisation or outsourcing is likely to be the consequence of failure to demonstrate value.
          Companies whose shares are traded freely on the stock markets face a further challenge.
          They must demonstrate they create more value than any other rival corporate parents could
          create. Failure to do so is likely to lead to a hostile takeover or break-up. Rival companies that
          think they can create more value out of the business units can bid for the company’s shares,
          on the expectation of either running the businesses better or selling them off to other poten-
          tial parents. If the rival’s bid is more attractive and credible than what the current parent can
          promise, shareholders will back it at the expense of incumbent management.
             In this sense, competition takes place between different corporate parents for the right to
          own and control businesses. In this ‘market for corporate control’, corporate parents must show
          that they have parenting advantage, on the same principle that business units must demon-
          strate competitive advantage. They must demonstrate that they are the best possible parents
          for the businesses they control. Parents therefore must be clear on how they create value. In
          practice, however, parenting activities can be value-destroying as well as value-creating.

          Value-adding activities18
          There are five main types of activity by which a corporate parent can potentially add value:

          • Envisioning. The corporate parent can provide a clear overall vision or strategic intent for
            its business units.19 This should guide and motivate business unit managers to maximise
            corporation-wide performance through commitment to a common purpose. Envisioning
            should also provide stakeholders with a clear external image about what the organisation
            as a whole is about: to reassure shareholders about the rationale for having a diversified
            strategy in the first place.20 Finally, a clear vision provides a discipline on the corporate
            parent to stop its wandering into inappropriate activities or taking on unnecessary costs.
          • Facilitating synergies. The corporate parent can facilitate cooperation and sharing across
            business units, so improving synergies from being within the same corporate organisation.
            This can be achieved through incentives, rewards and remuneration schemes.
          • Coaching. The corporate parent can help business unit managers develop capabilities,
            by coaching them to improve their skills and confidence. Corporate-wide management

                                                                                                        251
Chapter 8 Corporate strategy


                      courses are one effective means of achieving these objectives, as bringing managers across
                      the business to learn strategy skills also allows them to build relationships between each
                      other and perceive opportunities for cooperation.
                   • Providing central services and resources. The centre can provide capital for investment as well
                     as central services such as treasury, tax and human resource advice. If these are centralised
                     they may have sufficient scale to be efficient and can build up relevant expertise. Centralised
                     services often have greater leverage: for example, combining many business unit purchases
                     increases bargaining power for shared inputs such as energy. This leverage can be helpful
                     in brokering with external bodies, such as government regulators, or other companies in
                     negotiating alliances. Finally, the centre can have an important role in managing expertise
                     within the corporate whole, for instance by transferring managers across the business units
                     or by creating shared knowledge management systems via corporate intranets.
                   • Intervening. Finally, the corporate parent can also intervene within its business units to
                     ensure appropriate performance. The corporate parent should be able to closely monitor
                     business unit performance and improve performance either by replacing weak managers
                     or by assisting them in turning around their businesses. The parent can also challenge and
                     develop the strategic ambitions of business units, so good businesses are encouraged to
                     perform even better.


                   Value-destroying activities
                   However, there are three ways in which the corporate parent can inadvertently destroy value:

                   • Adding management costs. Most simply, corporate staff and facilities are expensive. Corpo-
                     rate staff are typically the best-paid managers with the most luxurious offices. It is the actual
                     businesses that have to generate the revenues that pay for them and if corporate centre costs
                     are greater than the value they create, then corporate staff are net value-destroying.
                   • Adding bureaucratic complexity. As well as these direct financial costs, there is the ‘bureau-
                     cratic fog’ created by an additional layer of management and the need to coordinate with
                     sister businesses. These typically slow down managers’ responses to issues and lead to
                     compromises between the interests of individual businesses.
                   • Obscuring financial performance. One danger in a large diversified company is that the
                     under-performance of weak businesses can be obscured. Weak businesses might be
                     cross-subsidised by stronger ones. Internally, the possibility of hiding weak performance
                     diminishes the incentives for business unit managers to strive as hard as they can for their
                     businesses: they have a parental safety net. Externally, shareholders and financial analysts
                     cannot easily judge the performance of individual units within the corporate whole. Diver-
                     sified companies’ share prices are often marked down, because shareholders prefer the
                     ‘pure plays’ of standalone units, where weak performance cannot be hidden.21

                   These dangers suggest clear paths for corporate parents that wish to avoid value destruc-
                   tion. They should keep a close eye on centre costs, both financial and bureaucratic, ensuring
                   that they are no more than required by their corporate strategy. They should also do all
                   they can to promote financial transparency, so that business units remain under pressure to
                   perform and shareholders are confident that there are no hidden disasters.
                      Overall, there are many ways in which corporate parents can add value. It is, of course,
                   difficult to pursue them all and some are hard to mix with others. For example, a corporate
                   parent that does a great deal of top-down intervening is less likely to be seen by its managers
                   as a helpful coach and facilitator. Business unit managers will concentrate on maximising
                   their own individual performance rather than looking out for ways to cooperate with
                   other business unit managers for the greater good of the whole. For this reason, corporate

parenting roles tend to fall into three main types, each coherent within itself but distinct from
the others.22 These three types of corporate parenting role are summarised in Figure 8.6.


8.6.2 The portfolio manager
The portfolio manager operates as an active investor in a way that shareholders in the
stock market are either too dispersed or too inexpert to be able to do. In effect, the port-
folio manager is acting as an agent on behalf of financial markets and shareholders with a
view to extracting more value from the various businesses than they could achieve them-
selves. They identify and acquire under-valued assets or businesses and improve them. They
may not be much concerned about relatedness typically adopting a conglomerate strategy.
Portfolio managers do not get closely involved in the routine management of the businesses,
only acting over short periods of time to improve performance by target setting, intervention
and the provision (or withdrawal) of investment.

Chapter 8 Corporate strategy


                      Portfolio managers seek to keep the cost of the centre low, with small corporate staff and
                   few central services, leaving the business units alone so that their chief executives have a high
                   degree of autonomy. They set clear financial targets for those chief executives, offering high
                   rewards if they achieve them and likely loss of position if they do not. Such corporate parents
                   can, of course, manage quite a large number of such businesses because they are not directly
                   managing the everyday strategies of those businesses.
                      Some argue that the days of the portfolio manager are gone. Improving financial markets
                   mean that the scope for finding and investing cheaply in under-performing companies is
                   much reduced. However, some portfolio managers remain and are successful (see Illustra-
                   tion 8.4). Private equity firms such as Blackstone operate a portfolio management style,
                   typically investing in, improving and then divesting companies in loosely knit portfolios.
                   For example, in 2015, Blackstone, with $434bn in assets, owned companies in automotive,
                   energy, entertainment, hotels, real estate, water treatment, banking, railway operation and
                   seed development with 500,000 employees around the world.


                   8.6.3 The synergy manager
                   Obtaining synergy is often seen as the prime rationale for the corporate parent.23 The
                   synergy manager is a corporate parent seeking to enhance value for business units by
                   managing synergies across business units. Synergies are likely to be particularly rich when
                   new activities are closely related to the core business. In terms of value-creating activities, the
                   focus is threefold: envisioning building a common purpose; facilitating cooperation across
                   businesses; and providing central services and resources. For example, at Apple, Steve Jobs’
                   vision of his personal computers being the digital hub of the new digital lifestyle guided
                   managers across the iMac computer, iPod, iPhone and iPad businesses to ensure seamless
                   connections between the fast-developing offerings. The result is enhanced value through
                   better customer experience.
                      However, achieving such synergistic benefits involves at least three challenges:

                   • Excessive costs. The benefits in sharing and cooperation need to outweigh the costs
                     of undertaking such integration, both direct financial costs and opportunity costs.
                     Managing synergistic relationships tends to involve expensive investments in manage-
                     ment time.
                   • Overcoming self-interest. Managers in the business units have to want to cooperate. Espe-
                     cially where managers are rewarded largely according to the performance of their own
                     particular business unit, they are likely to be unwilling to sacrifice their time and resources
                     for the common good.
                   • Illusory synergies. It is easy to overestimate the value of skills or resources to other busi-
                     nesses. This is particularly common when the corporate centre needs to justify a new
                     venture or the acquisition of a new company. Claimed synergies often prove illusory when
                     managers actually have to put them into practice.

                   The failure of many companies to extract expected synergies from their businesses has
                   led to growing scepticism about the notion of synergy. Synergistic benefits are not as
                   easy to achieve as would appear. For example, lawsuits between Hewlett Packard and
                   former Autonomy employees following the former’s €3.8bn (£3bn, $5bn) write down
                   of Autonomy, a British software company, have resulted from failure to achieve antici-
                   pated integration benefits. Hewlett Packard blamed the former management team of
                   Autonomy for fraudulent misrepresentation during the acquisition process. Nevertheless
                   synergy continues to be a common theme in corporate-level strategy, as Illustration 8.2 on
                   TomTom shows.

                   8.6.4 The parental developer24
                   The parental developer seeks to employ its own central capabilities to add value to its
                   businesses. This is not so much about how the parent can develop benefits across business
                   units or transfer capabilities between business units, as in the case of managing synergy.
                   Rather parental developers focus on the resources or capabilities they have as parents which
                   they can transfer downwards to enhance the potential of business units. For example, a
                   parent could have a valuable brand or specialist skills in financial management or product
                   development. It would seem that McDonald’s believed it had identified a parenting oppor-
                   tunity with its acquisition of Chipotle (Illustration 8.5). Parenting opportunities tend to be
                   more common in related rather than unrelated diversified strategies and are likely to involve
                   exchanges of managers and other resources across the businesses. Key value-creating activ-
                   ities for the parent will be the provision of central services and resources. For example, a
                   consumer products company might offer substantial guidance on branding and distribution
                   from the centre; a technology company might run a large central R&D laboratory.
                       There are two crucial challenges to managing a parental developer:

                   • Parental focus. Corporate parents need to be rigorous and focused in identifying their
                     unique value-adding capabilities. They should always be asking what others can do better
                     than them, and focus their energy and time on activities where they really do add value.
                     Other central services should typically be outsourced to specialist companies that can do
                     it better.
                   • The ‘crown jewel’ problem. Some diversified companies have business units in their port-
                     folios which are performing well but to which the parent adds little value. These can
                     become ‘crown jewels’, to which corporate parents become excessively attached. The logic
                     of the parental development approach is: if the centre cannot add value, it is just a cost
                     and therefore destroying value. Parental developers should divest businesses25 they do
                     not add value to, even profitable ones. Funds raised by selling a profitable business can
                     be reinvested in businesses where the parent can add value.




8.7 Portfolio matrices
                   Section 8.6 discussed rationales for corporate parents of multi-business organisations. This
                   section introduces models by which managers can determine financial investment and
                   divestment within their portfolios of business.26 Each model gives more or less attention to
                   at least one of three criteria:

                   • the balance of the portfolio (e.g. in relation to its markets and the needs of the corporation);
                   • the attractiveness of the business units in terms of how strong they are individually and
                     the growth rates of their markets or industries; and
                   • the ‘fit’ that the business units have with each other in terms of potential synergies or the
                     extent to which the corporate parent will be good at looking after them.



                   8.7.1 The BCG (or growth/share) matrix27
                   One of the most common and longstanding ways of conceiving of the balance of a port-
                   folio of businesses is the Boston Consulting Group (BCG) matrix (see Figure 8.7). The BCG
                   matrix uses market share and market growth criteria for determining the attractiveness

                                                                         8.7 Portfolio matrices


and balance of a business portfolio. High market share and high growth are, of course,
attractive. However, the BCG matrix also warns that high growth demands heavy investment,
for instance to expand capacity or develop brands. There needs to be a balance within the
portfolio, so that there are some low-growth businesses that are making sufficient surplus
to fund the investment needs of higher-growth businesses.
   The growth/share axes of the BCG matrix define four sorts of business:

• A star is a business unit within a portfolio that has a high market share in a growing
  market. The business unit may be spending heavily to keep up with growth, but high
  market share should yield sufficient profits to make it more or less self-sufficient in terms
  of investment needs.
• A question mark (or problem child) is a business unit within a portfolio that is in a growing
  market, but does not yet have high market share. Developing question marks into stars,
  with high market share, takes heavy investment. Many question marks fail to develop, so
  the BCG advises corporate parents to nurture several at a time. It is important to make
  sure that some question marks develop into stars, as existing stars eventually become cash
  cows and cash cows may decline into dogs.
• A cash cow is a business unit within a portfolio that has a high market share in a mature
  market. However, because growth is low, investment needs are less, while high market
  share means that the business unit should be profitable. The cash cow should then be a
  cash provider, helping to fund investments in question marks.
• Dogs are business units within a portfolio that have low share in static or declining markets
  and are thus the worst of all combinations. They may be a cash drain and use up a dispro-
  portionate amount of managerial time and company resources. The BCG usually recom-
  mends divestment or closure.

The BCG matrix has several advantages. It is a good way of visualising different needs and
potentials of all the diverse businesses within the corporate portfolio. It warns corporate
parents of the financial demands of what might otherwise look like a desirable portfolio
of high-growth businesses. It also reminds corporate parents that stars are likely eventually
to wane. Finally, it provides a useful discipline to business unit managers, underlining the
fact that the corporate parent ultimately owns the surplus resources they generate and can
allocate them according to what is best for the corporate whole. Cash cows should not hoard
their profits.

Chapter 8 Corporate strategy


                      However, there are at least four potential problems with the BCG matrix:

                   • Definitional vagueness. It can be hard to decide what high and low growth or share mean
                     in particular situations. Managers are often keen to define themselves as ‘high-share’ by
                     defining their market in a particularly narrow way (e.g. by ignoring relevant international
                     markets).
                   • Capital market assumptions. The notion that a corporate parent needs a balanced port-
                     folio to finance investment from internal sources (cash cows) assumes that capital cannot
                     be raised in external markets, for instance by issuing shares or raising loans. The notion
                     of a balanced portfolio may be more relevant in countries where capital markets are
                     under-developed or in private companies that wish to minimise dependence on external
                     shareholders or banks.

                   • Unkind to animals. Both cash cows and dogs receive ungenerous treatment, the first being
                     simply milked, the second terminated or cast out of the corporate home. This treatment
                     can cause motivation problems, as managers in these units see little point in working hard
                     for the sake of other businesses. There is also the danger of the self-fulfilling prophecy.
                     Cash cows will become dogs even more quickly than the model expects if they are simply
                     milked and denied adequate investment.

                   • Ignores commercial linkages. The matrix assumes there are no commercial ties to other
                     business units in the portfolio. For instance, a business unit in the portfolio may depend
                     upon keeping a dog alive. These commercial links are less important in conglomerate
                     strategies, where divestments or closures are unlikely to have knock-on effects on other
                     parts of the portfolio.


                   8.7.2 The directional policy (GE–McKinsey) matrix
                   Another way to consider a portfolio of businesses is by means of the directional policy
                   matrix,28 which categorises business units into those with good prospects and those with
                   less good prospects. The matrix was originally developed by McKinsey & Co. consultants
                   in order to help the American conglomerate General Electric manage its portfolio of busi-
                   ness units. Specifically, the directional policy matrix positions business units according to (i)
                   how attractive the relevant market is in which they are operating, and (ii) the competitive
                   strength of the SBU in that market. Attractiveness can be identified by PESTEL or five forces
                   analyses; business unit strength can be defined by competitor analysis (for instance, the
                   strategy canvas); see Section 3.4.3. Some analysts also choose to show graphically how large
                   the market is for a given business unit’s activity, and even the market share of that business
                   unit, as shown in Figure 8.8.
                       For example, managers in a firm with the portfolio shown in Figure 8.8 will be concerned
                   that they have relatively low shares in the largest and most attractive market, whereas their
                   greatest strength is in a market with only medium attractiveness and smaller markets with
                   little long-term attractiveness.
                       The matrix also offers strategy guidelines given the positioning of the business units. It
                   suggests that the businesses with the highest growth potential and the greatest strength
                   are those in which to invest for growth. Those that are the weakest and in the least attractive
                   markets should be divested or ‘harvested’ (i.e. used to yield as much cash as possible before
                   divesting).
                       The directional policy matrix is more complex than the BCG matrix. However, it can have
                   two advantages. First, unlike the simpler four-box BCG matrix, the nine cells of the directional
                   policy matrix acknowledge the possibility of a difficult middle ground. Here managers have
                   to be carefully selective. In this sense, the directional policy matrix is less mechanistic than

                    the BCG matrix, encouraging open debate on less clear-cut cases. Second, the two axes of
                    the directional policy matrix are not based on single measures (i.e. market share and market
                    growth). Business strength can derive from many other factors than market share, and
                    industry attractiveness does not just boil down to industry growth rates. On the other hand,
                    the directional policy matrix shares some problems with the BCG matrix, particularly about
                    vague definitions, capital market assumptions, motivation and self-fulfilling prophecy and
                    ignoring commercial linkages. Overall, however, the value of the matrix is to help managers
                    invest in the businesses that are most likely to pay off.
                       So far the discussion has been about the logic of portfolios in terms of balance and attract-
                    iveness. The third logic is to do with ‘fit’ with the particular capabilities of the corporate
                    parent.


                    8.7.3 The parenting matrix
                    The parenting matrix (or Ashridge Portfolio Display) developed by consultants Michael Goold
                    and Andrew Campbell introduces parental fit as an important criterion for including busi-
                    nesses in the portfolio.29
                       Businesses may be attractive in terms of the BCG or directional policy matrices, but if the
                    parent cannot add value, then the parent ought to be cautious about acquiring or retaining
                    them.
                       There are two key dimensions of fit in the parenting matrix (see Figure 8.9):

                    • ‘Feel’. This is a measure of the fit between each business unit’s critical success factors
                      (see Section 3.4.3) and the capabilities (in terms of competences and resources) of the
                      corporate parent. In other words, does the corporate parent have the necessary ‘feel’, or
                      understanding, for the businesses it will parent?

• ‘Benefit’. This measures the fit between the parenting opportunities, or needs, of busi-
  ness units and the capabilities of the parent. Parenting opportunities are about the
  upside, areas in which good parenting can benefit the business (for instance, by bringing
  marketing expertise). For the benefit to be realised, of course, the parent must have the
  right capabilities to match the parenting opportunities.

The power of using these two dimensions of fit is as follows. It is easy to see that a corporate
parent should avoid running businesses that it has no feel for. What is less clear is that
parenting should be avoided if there is no benefit. This challenges the corporate parenting
of even businesses for which the parent has high feel. Businesses for which a corporate
parent has high feel but can add little benefit should either be run with a very light touch
or be divested.
   Figure 8.8 shows four kinds of business along these two dimensions of feel and benefit:

• Heartland business units are ones that the parent understands well and can continue to
  add value to. They should be at the core of future strategy.
• Ballast business units are ones the parent understands well but can do little for. They
  would probably be at least as successful as independent companies. If not divested, they
  should be spared as much corporate bureaucracy as possible.
• Value trap business units are dangerous. They appear attractive because there are oppor-
  tunities to add value (for instance, marketing could be improved). But they are deceptively

                                                                                                            261

                         attractive, because the parent’s lack of feel will result in more harm than good (i.e. the
                         parent lacks the right marketing skills). The parent will need to acquire new capabilities
                         if it is to be able to move value trap businesses into the heartland. It might be easier to
                         divest to another corporate parent that could add value, and will pay well for the chance.
                      • Alien business units are clear misfits. They offer little opportunity to add value and the
                        parent does not understand them anyway. Exit is definitely the best strategy.

                      This approach to considering corporate portfolios places the emphasis firmly on how the
                      parent benefits the business units. It requires careful analysis of both parenting capabilities
                      and business unit parenting needs. The parenting matrix can therefore assist hard decisions
                      where either high feel or high parenting opportunities tempt the corporate parent to acquire
                      or retain businesses. Parents should concentrate on actual or potential heartland businesses,
                      where there is both high feel and high benefit.30
                         The concept of fit has equal relevance in the public sector. The implication is that public-
                      sector managers should control directly only those services and activities for which they have
                      special managerial expertise. Other services should be outsourced or set up as independent
                      agencies (see Section 8.5).

Summary
• Many corporations comprise several, sometimes many, business units. Corporate strategy
  involves the decisions and activities above the level of business units. It is concerned with
  choices concerning the scope of the organisation.
• Organisational scope is often considered in terms of related and unrelated diversification.
• Related diversification involves increasing the range of products, services and markets served
  by an organisation. Benefits come from economies of scope, stretching corporate manage-
  ment capabilities, exploiting superior internal processes and increasing market power.
• Unrelated diversification involves expanding into products, services and markets with no
  relationship to the existing business. Benefits may come from risk reduction and portfolio
  management.
• There are several portfolio models to help corporate parents manage their businesses,
  of which the most common are: the BCG matrix, the directional policy matrix and the
  parenting matrix.
• Divestment and outsourcing should be considered as well as diversification, particularly in
  the light of relative capabilities and the transaction costs of opportunism.
• Corporate parents may seek to add value by adopting different parenting roles: the port-
  folio manager, the synergy manager or the parental developer.




Work assignments
✱ Denotes more advanced work assignments.
* Refers to a case study in the Text and Cases edition.

8.1   Using the Ansoff axes (Figure 8.2), identify and explain corporate strategic directions
      for any one of these case organisations: CRH*, Marks & Spencer*, Megabrew*.
8.2   Go to the website of any large multi-business organisation (e.g. Alphabet, Megabrew*,
      Siemens, Tata Group, Virgin Group) and assess the degree to which its corporate-
      level strategy is characterised by (a) related or unrelated diversification and (b) a
      coherent ‘dominant logic’ (see Section 7.3).
8.3   For any large multi-business corporation (as in Section 8.2), Marks & Spencer* or
      the Virgin Group, explain how the corporate parent should best create value for its
      component businesses (as portfolio manager, synergy manager or parental devel-
      oper: see Section 8.6). Would all the businesses fit equally well?
8.4✱ For any large multi-business corporation (as in Section 8.2), Megabrew* or the Virgin
     Group (end of chapter case), plot the business units on a portfolio matrix (e.g. the
     BCG matrix: Section 8.7.1). Justify any assumptions about the relative positions of
     businesses on the relevant axes of the matrix. What managerial conclusions do you
     draw from this analysis?

Integrative assignment
8.5   Take a case of a recent merger or acquisition (see Chapter 11), and assess the extent
      to which it involved related or unrelated diversification (if either) and how far it was
      consistent with the company’s existing dominant logic. Using share price information
      (see www.bigcharts.com or similar), assess shareholders’ reaction to the merger or
      acquisition. How do you explain this reaction?

Grand strategies in vision
by Peter Barton

Seeing opportunities
Most wearers of prescription eyewear and sunglasses
are aware of the large retail brands on their high street
and, increasingly online, as well as many of the brand
names that they sell. What many are less aware of is the
giant companies that operate the manufacturing of the
vast majority of the products behind this industry, which
was worth $109bn (£82bn/€93bn) in 2018 and is set to
grow 7.4 per cent each year until 2023 to around $167bn
(£125bn/€142bn) (ResearchAndMarkets.com, 2018).
    While the continued growth in prescriptive eyewear
came about in part due to a rapid worldwide popula-
tion increase, the number of those requiring corrective
prescriptions has also risen dramatically. This may be

    The other important frame brand to Luxottica is Oakley
but this was a brand acquired through much hostility. In
2000, Luxottica asked all its suppliers to reduce its prices to
them, but despite its stores making up over 25 per cent of
Oakley’s business, Oakley refused to comply. Del Vecchio’s
response was to produce Ray-Bans reportedly more similar
to Oakley’s designs leading to Oakley suing them in 2001,
which ultimately ended in an out-of-court settlement.
Perhaps as a show of strength from Del Vecchio, in 2007,
Luxottica purchased Oakley for $2.1bn (£1.5bn).
    As a result of many acquisitions and significant brand
growth, Luxottica now supplies over 25 per cent of the
world’s frames, catering for multiple market segments. As

9.1 Introduction
          The last chapter introduced market development as a strategy, in relation to the Ansoff axes
          (see Section 8.2.3). This chapter focuses on a specific but important kind of market devel-
          opment, operating in different geographical markets. Many types of organisations expand
          internationally and face new customer needs and are challenged by local economic, regu-
          latory, political and cultural institutions that often differ substantially from home. There are
          of course the large traditional multinationals such as Nestlé, Toyota and McDonald’s. But
          recent years have seen the rise of emerging-country multinationals from Brazil, Russia, India
          and China. New small firms, like internet-based start-ups, are also increasingly ‘born global’,
          building international relationships right from the start. Likewise, not-for-profit organisa-
          tions like the Red Cross and Doctors without Borders have been working internationally from
          the beginning. Public-sector organisations also have to make choices about collaboration,
          outsourcing and even competition with overseas organisations. For example, European
          Union legislation requires public service organisations to accept tenders from non-national
          suppliers.
             Figure 9.1 identifies the five main themes of this chapter, with international strategy as
          the core. The themes are as follows:

          • Internationalisation drivers. Drivers of an organisation’s internationalisation include
            market demand, the potential for cost advantages, government pressures and induce-
            ments, and the need to respond to competitor moves. Given the risks and costs of inter-
            national strategy, managers need to know that the drivers are strong to justify adopting
            an international strategy in the first place.
          • Geographical and firm-specific advantages. In international competition, advantages
            might come from firm-specific and geographical advantages. Firm-specific advantages
            are the unique resources and capabilities proprietary to an organisation as discussed in

                       Chapter 4. Geographical advantages might come both from the geographic location of
                       the original business and from the international configuration of their value system.
                    • International strategy. If drivers and advantages are sufficiently strong to merit an inter-
                      national strategy, then a range of strategic approaches are opened up, from the simplest
                      export strategies to the most complex global strategies.
                    • Market selection. Having adopted the broad approach to international strategy, the next
                      question is which country markets to prioritise and which to steer clear of. Here managers
                      need to consider differences and distances in economic, regulatory, political and cultural
                      institutions.
                    • Entry strategy mode. Finally, once target countries are selected, managers must determine
                      how they should enter each particular market. Again, export is a simple place to start, but
                      there are licensing, franchising, joint venture and wholly owned subsidiary (acquisition or
                      ‘greenfield’ investments) alternatives to consider as well.

                    The chapter takes a cautious view on international strategy. Despite the widespread talk of
                    increasing ‘globalisation’, there are many challenges and pressures for being local or regional
                    as well. Impediments to global integration and connectedness remain high and the degree
                    of globalisation is often overstated and has slowed down considerably since the financial
                    crisis 2008.1 The chapter will therefore distinguish between international strategy and global
                    strategy and consider the financial performance implications of growing internationalisa-
                    tion.2 International strategy refers to a range of options for operating outside an organ-
                    isation’s country of origin. Global strategy is only one kind of international strategy. Global
                    strategy involves high coordination of extensive activities dispersed geographically in
                    many countries around the world.



9.2 Internationalisation drivers
                    There are many general pressures increasing internationalisation. Barriers to international
                    trade and investment are now lower than they were a couple of decades ago. Better inter-
                    national legal frameworks mean that it is now less risky to deal with unfamiliar partners.
                    Improvements in communications – from cheaper air travel to the Internet – make move-
                    ment and the spread of ideas much easier around the world. Not least, the success of new
                    economic powerhouses such as the so-called ‘BRICs’ (Brazil, Russia, India and China) or the
                    rising ‘MINTs’ (Mexico, Indonesia, Nigeria and Turkey) – are generating new opportunities
                    and challenges for business internationally.3
                        However, far from all internationalisation trends are one-way. Nor do they hold for all
                    industries. Trade barriers still exist for some products, especially those relating to defence
                    technologies, and barriers have increased since the financial crisis 2008. Certain companies
                    are not welcome in some countries, like Huawei in the US and Facebook and Twitter in China.
                    Many countries also protect their leading companies from takeover by overseas rivals. In
                    addition, markets vary widely in the extent to which consumer needs are standardising –
                    compare computer operating systems to the highly variable national tastes in chocolate.
                    Some so-called multinationals are in fact concentrated in very particular markets, for example
                    North America and Western Europe, or have a quite limited set of international links, for
                    example in supply or outsourcing arrangements with just one or two countries overseas. In
                    short, managers need to beware of ‘global boloney’, by which economic integration into a
                    single homogenised and competitive world is wildly exaggerated.4 The US discount retailer
                    Walmart has learned the hard way that international markets are not only very different from
                    home, but differ significantly from each other (see Illustration 9.1).5

                       Given internationalisation’s complexity, international strategy should be underpinned
                    by a careful assessment of trends in each particular market. George Yip at China Europe
                    International Business School provides a framework for analysing ‘drivers of globalisation’.
                    In the terms of this chapter, these drivers can be thought of as ‘internationalisation drivers’
                    more generally. In this book, therefore, Yip’s globalisation framework sees international
                    strategy potential as determined by market drivers, cost drivers, government drivers and
                    competitive drivers (see Figure 9.2).6 In more detail, the four internationalisation drivers
                    are as follows:

                    • Market drivers. A critical facilitator of internationalisation is standardisation of market char-
                      acteristics. There are three components underlying this driver. First, the presence of similar
                      customer needs and tastes: for example, the fact that in most societies consumers have
                      similar needs for easy credit has promoted the worldwide spread of a handful of credit
                      card companies such as Visa. Second is the presence of global customers: for example, car
                      component companies have become more international as their customers, such as Toyota
                      or Ford, have internationalised, and required standardised components for their factories
                      around the world. Finally, transferable marketing promotes market globalisation: brands
                      such as Coca-Cola are still successfully marketed in very similar ways across the world.
                    • Cost drivers. Costs can be reduced by operating internationally. Again, there are three main
                      elements to cost drivers. First, increasing volume beyond what a national market might
                      support can give scale economies, both on the production side and in purchasing of supplies.
                      Companies from smaller countries such as the Netherlands, Switzerland and Taiwan tend
                      therefore to become proportionately much more international than companies from the
                      USA, which have a vast market at home. Scale economies are particularly important in

  industries with high product development costs, as in the aircraft industry, where initial
  development costs need to be spread over the large volumes of international markets.
  Second, internationalisation is promoted where it is possible to take advantage of variations
  in country-specific differences. It thus makes sense to locate the manufacture of clothing in
  Africa or Bangladesh where labour is still considerably cheaper, but to keep design activities
  in cities such as New York, Paris, Milan or London, where fashion expertise is concentrated.
  The third element is favourable logistics, or the costs of moving products or services across
  borders relative to their final value. From this point of view, microchips are easy to source
  internationally, while bulky materials such as assembled furniture are harder.
• Government drivers. There are three main factors here that facilitate internationalisation.
  First, reduction of barriers to trade and investment has accelerated internationalisation.
  During the last couple of decades governments have reduced restrictions on both flow of
  goods and capital. The World Trade Organization has been instrumental in reducing trade
  barriers globally.7 Similarly, the emergence of regional economic integration partner-
  ships like the European Union (EU), the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN)
  Economic Community and the United States–Mexico–Canada Agreement (USMCA) (The
  trade agreement is signed but yet not ratified.) has promoted this development. No
  government, however, allows complete economic openness and it typically varies widely
  from industry to industry, with agriculture and high-tech industries related to defence
  likely to be particularly sensitive. Even if trade barriers have been reduced the last few
  years have seen a push back by the USA against international trade and trade agree-
  ments with raised trade tariffs, renegotiations of international trade agreements and
  blocking sensitive Chinese technology companies. Likewise, US companies like Google
  and Facebook have encountered new barriers and regulations from Chinese authorities.
  The liberalisation and adoption of free markets in many countries around the globe have
  also encouraged international trade and investments. Economic and free market reforms
  in China and later in Eastern Europe and Russia have been followed by market-based
  reforms in numerous Asian, South American and African economies. A third important
  government factor is technology standardisation. Compatible technical standards make
  it easier for companies to access different markets as they can enter many markets with
  the same product or service without adapting to local idiosyncratic standards.
• Competitive drivers. These relate specifically to globalisation as an integrated worldwide
  strategy rather than simpler international strategies (see Section 9.4). These have two
  elements. First, interdependence between country operations increases the pressure for
  global coordination. Company value chains are increasingly fragmented with suppliers,
  manufacturing and sales dispersed over a range of different countries facing various compet-
  itive and customer pressures. For example, a business with a plant in Mexico that sources
  parts in Brazil and serves both the US and the Japanese markets has to coordinate carefully
  between the different locations: surging sales in one country, or a collapse in another, will
  have significant knock-on effects on the other countries. The second element relates directly
  to competitor strategy. The presence of globalised competitors increases the pressure to
  adopt a global strategy in response because competitors may use one country’s profits to
  cross-subsidise their operations in another. A company with a loosely coordinated inter-
  national strategy is vulnerable to globalised competitors, because it is unable to support
  country subsidiaries under attack from targeted, subsidised competition. The danger is of
  piecemeal withdrawal from countries under attack, and the gradual undermining of any
  overall economies of scale that the international player may have started with.8

The key insight from Yip’s drivers framework is that the internationalisation potential of
industries is variable. There are many different factors that can support it as indicated above,
but others can inhibit it. For example, customer needs and tastes for many food products

                                                                                             275
Chapter 9 International strategy


                    inhibit their internationalisation and local governments often impose tariff barriers, owner-
                    ship restrictions and local content requirements on foreign entrants. An important step in
                    determining an internationalisation strategy is a realistic assessment of the true scope for
                    internationalisation in the particular industry.


9.3 Geographic sources of advantage
                    A company entering a market from overseas typically starts with considerable disadvantages
                    relative to local competitors, which will usually have superior knowledge of the local market
                    and its institutions. When firms expand internationally they thus start with a liability of foreign-
                    ness and face additional costs of doing business compared with local firms as these already
                    have established relationships with customers, suppliers and authorities.9 A foreign entrant
                    must therefore have significant firm-specific competitive advantages for it to overcome these
                    inherent advantages of local competitors. Tesco’s failure in the USA is an example of this. After
                    seven years and investments of about £1bn (€1.2bn) in its ’US ‘Fresh & Easy’ business Tesco was
                    forced to withdraw. Unlike in the UK, Tesco had limited competitive advantage over the strong
                    US domestic retailers. Internationalisation thus requires building on the sources of sustain-
                    able competitive advantage that we have discussed earlier in Chapters 4 and 7 including the
                    organisation’s unique strengths in resources and capabilities and business strategy. While
                    these firm- or organisation-specific advantages are important, competitive advantage in an
                    international context also depends on country-specific or geographic advantages.10
                        As the earlier discussion of cost drivers in international strategy has shown, the geograph-
                    ical location of activities is a crucial source of potential advantage and one of the distin-
                    guishing features of international strategy relative to other diversification strategies. Bruce
                    Kogut at Columbia University has explained that an organisation can improve the configur-
                    ation of its value chain and system (see Section 4.4.3) by taking advantage of country-specific
                    differences.11 There are two principal opportunities available: the exploitation of particular
                    locational advantages, in the company’s home country, and sourcing advantages overseas
                    via an international value system.
                        Managers need to appraise these potential sources of competitive advantage carefully:
                    if there are no firm-specific or geographical competitive advantages, international strategy
                    is liable to fail.


                    9.3.1 Locational advantage: Porter’s diamond12
                    Countries and regions within them, and organisations originating in those, often benefit
                    from competitive advantages grounded in specific local conditions. They become associated
                    with specific types of enduring competitive advantage: for example, the Swiss in private
                    banking, the northern Italians in leather and fur fashion goods, and the Taiwanese in laptop
                    computers. Michael Porter has proposed a four-pointed ‘diamond’ to explain why some loca-
                    tions tend to produce firms with competitive advantages in some industries more than others
                    (see Figure 9.3). Specifically, Porter’s Diamond suggests that locational advantages may
                    stem from local factor conditions; local demand conditions; local related and supporting
                    industries; and from local firm strategy structure and rivalry. These four interacting deter-
                    minants of locational advantage work as follows:

                    • Factor conditions. These refer to the ‘factors of production’ that go into making a product
                      or service (i.e. raw materials, land and labour). Factor condition advantages at a national
                      level can translate into general competitive advantages for national firms in international
                      markets. For example, the linguistic ability of the Swiss has traditionally provided a

   significant advantage to their banking industry. Cheap energy has traditionally provided
   an advantage for the North American aluminium industry.
• Home demand conditions. The nature of the domestic customers can become a source of
  competitive advantage. Dealing with sophisticated and demanding customers at home helps
  train a company to be effective overseas. For example, America’s long distances have led to
  competitive strength in very large truck engines. Sophisticated local customers in France and
  Italy have helped keep their local fashion industries at the leading edge for many decades.
• Related and supporting industries. Local ‘clusters’ of related and mutually supporting
  industries can be an important source of competitive advantage. These are often region-
  ally based, making personal interaction easier. In northern Italy, for example, the leather
  footwear industry, the leatherworking machinery industry and the design services that
  underpin them group together in the same regional cluster to each other’s mutual
  benefit. Silicon Valley forms a cluster of hardware, software, research and venture capital
  organisations that together create a virtuous circle of high-technology enterprise.
• Firm strategy, industry structure and rivalry. The characteristic strategies, industry structures
  and rivalries in different countries can also be bases of advantage. German companies’
  strategy of investing in technical excellence gives them a characteristic advantage in
  engineering industries and creates large pools of expertise. A competitive local industry
  structure is also helpful: if too dominant in their home territory, local organisations can
  become complacent and lose advantage overseas. Some domestic rivalry can actually be
  an advantage, therefore. For example, the Swiss pharmaceuticals industry became strong
  in part because each company had to compete with several strong local rivals.

  Porter’s Diamond model underlines the environmental conditions and structural attri-
butes of nations and their regions that contribute to their competitive advantage and to

                                                                                                                 277

                    firms coming from them. It has been used by governments aiming to increase the competi-
                    tive advantage of their local industries. The argument that rivalry can be positive has led to
                    a major policy shift in many countries towards encouraging local competition rather than
                    protecting home-based industries. Governments can also foster local industries by raising
                    safety or environmental standards (i.e. creating sophisticated demand conditions) or encour-
                    aging cooperation between suppliers and buyers on a domestic level (i.e. building clusters
                    of related and supporting industries in particular regions).
                       For individual organisations, however, the value of Porter’s Diamond is to identify the
                    extent to which they can build on home-based advantages to create competitive advan-
                    tage in relation to others internationally. To compete with local actors, organisations must
                    carefully exploit the distinct environmental conditions and structural attributes illustrated
                    in Figure 9.3. For example, Dutch brewing companies – such as Heineken – had an advan-
                    tage in early internationalisation due to the combination of sophisticated consumers and
                    limited room to grow at home. Volvo Trucks, the Swedish truck and construction equipment
                    manufacturer, has achieved global success by building on a local network of sophisticated
                    engineering partners and suppliers and a local demand orientated towards reliability and
                    safety. Before embarking on an internationalisation strategy, managers should thus seek
                    out sources of general locational advantage to underpin their company’s individual sources
                    of advantage.


                    9.3.2 The international value system
                    The sources of geographic advantage need, however, not be purely domestic. In addition,
                    as companies continue to internationalise, the country of origin becomes relatively less
                    important for competitive advantage. For companies with most of their sales abroad, like
                    the telecom giant Ericsson with 95 per cent of sales outside its home country Sweden, the
                    configuration of the international environments where they operate is at least as important
                    as their domestic environment. This implies that for international companies, advantage
                    also needs to be drawn from the international configuration of their value system (see
                    Section 4.4.3). Here the different skills, resources and costs of countries around the world
                    can be systematically exploited in order to locate each element of the value chain in that
                    country or region where it can be conducted most effectively and efficiently. Large multi-
                    national companies often develop and manage complex global supply chains in this way.
                    This may be achieved through both foreign direct investments and joint ventures but also
                    through global sourcing: purchasing services and components from the most appropriate
                    suppliers around the world, regardless of their location. For example, in the UK for many
                    years the National Health Service has been sourcing medical personnel from overseas to
                    offset a shortfall in domestic skills and capacity. Smaller organisations can also build on the
                    broader system of suppliers, channels and customers as demonstrated in Illustration 9.2.
                       Locational advantages can be of different kinds. Facebook, for example, has located huge
                    centres for their servers in the northern part of Sweden not only because of the low energy
                    cooling costs due to a cold climate, but because of local technology capabilities and skills
                    and Sweden’s policy of low CO2 emissions. Different locational advantages can be identified:

                    • Cost advantages include labour costs, transportation and communications costs and
                      taxation and investment incentives. Labour costs are important. American and European
                      firms, for example, have moved much of their software programming tasks to India where
                      a computer programmer costs an American firm about one quarter of what it would pay
                      for a worker with comparable skills in the USA. As wages in India have risen, however,
                      some IT firms have started to move work to even more low-cost locations such as Thailand
                      and Vietnam.

                    • Unique local capabilities may allow an organisation to enhance its competitive advantage.
                      Gradually, value-creating and innovative activity become geographically dispersed across
                      multiple centres of excellence within multinational organisations.13 For example, leading
                      European pharmaceuticals company GSK has R&D laboratories in Boston and the Research
                      Triangle in North Carolina in order to establish research collaborations with the prominent
                      universities and hospitals in those areas. Internationalisation, therefore, is increasingly not
                      only about exploiting an organisation’s existing capabilities in new national markets, but
                      about developing and drawing on capabilities found elsewhere in the world.
                    • National market characteristics can enable organisations to develop differentiated
                      product offerings aimed at different market segments. American guitar-maker Gibson,
                      for example, complements its US-made products with often similar, lower-cost alternatives
                      produced in South Korea under the Epiphone brand. However, because of the American
                      music tradition, Gibson’s high-end guitars benefit from the reputation of still being ‘made
                      in the USA’.




9.4 International strategies
                    Given their organisation-specific advantages and the ability to obtain sources of inter-
                    national competitive advantage through geographic home-based factors or international
                    value systems, organisations still face difficult questions about what kind of international
                    strategy to pursue. The fundamental issue in formulating an international strategy is to
                    balance pressures for global integration versus those for local responsiveness.14 Pressures for
                    global integration encourage organisations to coordinate their activities across diverse
                    countries to gain efficient operations. The internationalisation drivers discussed above
                    (Section 9.2) indicate forces that organisations can build on to achieve lower costs and higher
                    quality in operations and activities on a global scale. However, there are conflicting pressures
                    that also encourage organisations to become locally responsive and meet the specific needs
                    in each individual country (see Section 9.5.1 below). Values and attitudes, economics, political
                    institutions, cultures and laws differ across countries, which imply differences in customer
                    preferences, product and service standards, regulations and human resources that all need
                    to be addressed. These two opposing pressures – global integration vs. local responsiveness
                    – put contradictory demands on an organisation’s international strategy. High pressure for
                    global integration implies an increased need to concentrate and coordinate operations glob-
                    ally. In contrast, high pressure for local responsiveness implies a greater need to disperse
                    operations and adapt to local demand.
                       This key problem is sometimes referred to as the global–local dilemma: the extent to
                    which products and services may be standardised across national boundaries or need
                    to be adapted to meet the requirements of specific national markets. For some prod-
                    ucts and services – such as TVs – markets appear similar across the world, offering huge
                    potential scale economies if design, production and delivery can be centralised. For other
                    products and services – such as processed food – tastes still seem highly national-specific,
                    drawing companies to decentralise operations and control as near as possible to the
                    local market.
                       This dilemma between global integration and local responsiveness suggests several
                    possible international strategies, ranging from emphasising one of the dimensions to
                    complex responses that try to combine both. Organisations need to assess to what degree
                    there are potential advantages of cost and quality of global integration and balance those
                    pressures against the need to adapt products and/or services to local conditions. This section

introduces four different kinds of international strategy, based on strategic choices and
management about this balance (see Figure 9.4). The four basic international strategies are:15

• Export strategy. This strategy leverages home country capabilities, innovations and prod-
  ucts in different foreign countries. It is advantageous when both pressures for global
  integration and local responsiveness are low, as shown in Figure 9.4. Companies that have
  distinctive capabilities together with strong reputation and brand names often follow this
  strategy with success. Google, for example, centralises its R&D and the core architecture
  underlying its internet search services at its headquarters in California in the USA and
  exploits it internationally with minor adaptations except for local languages and alpha-
  bets. The downside of this approach is the limits of a home country centralised view of
  the business with risks of skilled local competitors getting ahead. Google, for example,
  meets strong local rivals in Baidu in China and Naver in Korea both of which have superior
  mastery of the language and understanding of local consumer behaviour and regulation.
• Multi-domestic strategy. This is a strategy that maximises local responsiveness. It is based
  on different product or service offerings and operations in each country depending on
  local market conditions and customer preferences. Each country is treated differently with
  considerable autonomy for each country manager to best meet the needs of local markets
  and customers in that particular country. As with the export strategy, this strategy is simi-
  larly loosely coordinated internationally. The organisation becomes a collection of rela-
  tively independent units with value chain activities adapted to specific local conditions.
  This multi-domestic approach is particularly appropriate when there are strong benefits
  to adapting to local needs and when there are limited efficiency gains from integration.
  It is common in food and consumer product industries where local idiosyncratic prefer-
  ences are significant. Marketing-driven companies often pursue this type of strategy. For
  example, Frito-Lay, a US branded-snacks company, tailors its global products to local tastes
  and even creates entirely new snack products for local markets.16 The disadvantages of
  a multi-domestic strategy include manufacturing inefficiencies, a proliferation of costly
  product and service variations and risks towards brand and reputation if national practices
  become too diverse.
• Global strategy. This is a strategy that maximises global integration. In this strategy the
  world is seen as one marketplace with standardised products and services that fully

                                                                                             281
Chapter 9 International strategy


                       exploits integration and efficiency in operations. The focus is on capturing scale economies
                       and exploiting location economies worldwide with geographically dispersed value chain
                       activities being coordinated and controlled centrally from headquarters. In these respects,
                       this strategy is the exact opposite to the multi-domestic strategy. A global strategy is
                       most beneficial when there are substantial cost or quality efficiency benefits from stand-
                       ardisation and when customer needs are relatively homogeneous across countries. It is
                       a common strategy for commodities or commodity-like products. For example, Mexican
                       Cemex, one of the largest cement companies in the world, follows a global strategy with
                       centralised and shared services in information technology, R&D, human resources and
                       financial services across countries and regions.17 Non-commodity companies can also
                       follow a global strategy, like Sweden’s furniture retailer IKEA. Based on a strong home
                       base they standardise products and marketing with limited local adaptation to gain
                       maximum global integration efficiency. The drawback of the global strategy is reduced
                       flexibility due to standardisation that limits possibilities to adapt activities and products
                       to local conditions. This has, for example, led IKEA to make minor modifications of some
                       furniture offerings to suit local tastes.
                    • Transnational strategy. This is the most complex strategy that tries to maximise both respon-
                      siveness and integration. Its aim is to unite the key advantages of the multi-domestic and
                      global strategies while minimising their disadvantages. In addition, it maximises learning
                      and knowledge exchange between dispersed units. In this strategy products and services
                      and operational activities are, subject to minimum efficiency standards, adapted to local
                      conditions in each country. In contrast to the multi-domestic strategy, however, this
                      strategy also leverages learning and innovation across units in different countries. The
                      value chain configuration includes an intricate combination of centralised manufacturing
                      to increase efficiency combined with distributed assembly and local adaptations. Coordin-
                      ation is neither centralised at home nor dispersed in foreign countries, but knowledge
                      flows between units are encouraged from wherever ideas and innovations come from.
                      The major advantage of this strategy is its capacity to support efficiency and effectiveness
                      while at the same time being able to serve local needs and leverage learning across units.
                      General Electric has been celebrated as having a transnational strategy that emphasises
                      seeking and exchanging ideas irrespective of where they come from. The company swaps
                      ideas regarding efficiency, business processes, customer responsiveness and innovation
                      across different parts of the value chain and diverse countries worldwide.18 However,
                      while it is argued that transnational strategies are becoming increasingly necessary, many
                      firms find it difficult to implement given its complexity and the fundamental trade-off
                      between integration and responsiveness. ABB, the Swiss–Swedish engineering giant, was
                      once identified as the archetypal transnational company, but later ran into serious prob-
                      lems.19 They have since tried to find the middle ground in a more regional strategy – a
                      compromise discussed below.

                    In practice, these four international strategies are not absolutely distinct as indicated by
                    the overlapping ovals in Figure 9.4. They are rather illustrative examples of alternative
                    international strategies with global integration and local responsiveness being matters of
                    degree rather than sharp distinctions. Moreover, choices between them will be influenced by
                    changes in the internationalisation drivers introduced earlier. It is rare that companies adopt
                    a pure form of international strategy; instead they often blend approaches and are located
                    somewhere between the four strategies. As exemplified above, IKEA has a global strategy,
                    but also makes some minor local adaptations, which may eventually move the company
                    towards more of a transnational strategy.
                       Often regions (e.g. Europe or North America) play a larger role in international strategy
                    than individual countries or global expansion. Thus many multinationals compromise

                                                                             9.5 Market selection and entry


          between local and global logics by opting for regional strategies.20 The aim of this strategy
          is to attain some of the economic efficiency and location advantages while simultaneously
          reaching local adaptation advantages. Regions are treated as relatively homogenous markets
          with value chain activities concentrated within them. Sales data suggests that many multi-
          national companies follow this type of strategy focused on one or two regions including the
          triad of Europe, North America and/or Japan/Asia.21 For example, over 85 per cent of all cars
          sold within each of these regions are built in that same region. This regional approach to
          international strategy shows that distances and differences between nations are still rela-
          tively large (see Section 9.5.1 below), which makes global integration difficult.
              These differences can, however, be exploited in arbitrage for value creation. Arbitrage
          implies that multinationals take advantage of price differences between two or more
          markets by purchasing goods cheaply in one market and selling them at a higher price in
          another. For example, Walmart is known for sourcing much of what the company sells in
          the USA from China. Not only purchasing price differences, but differences in labour costs, in
          knowledge, capital and taxes can be exploited by operating in diverse countries. The poten-
          tial for arbitrage in multinationals is substantial and it has been suggested as a third signif-
          icant international strategy dimension, besides integration and responsiveness. 22 Finally,
          different international strategies require diverse organising requirements for success, which
          are discussed in Chapter 14 (Section 14.2.4).



9.5 Market selection and entry
          Having decided on an international strategy built on significant sources of competitive
          advantage and supported by strong internationalisation drivers, managers next need to
          decide which countries to enter. There are substantial differences in customer needs and in
          economic, regulative–administrative, political and cultural institutions. To an extent, however,
          countries can initially be compared using standard environmental analysis techniques, for
          example along the dimensions identified in the PESTEL framework (see Section 2.2) or
          according to the five forces (Section 3.3) for specific industries. However, there are specific
          determinants of market attractiveness that need to be considered in internationalisation
          strategy: the intrinsic characteristics of the country and market. A key point is how initial esti-
          mates of country attractiveness can be modified by considering various measures of distance
          and the likelihood of competitor retaliation. The section concludes by considering different
          entry strategy modes into national markets.


          9.5.1 Country and market characteristics
          A common procedure for evaluating a nation’s potential for entry is to analyse its economic
          conditions (GDP, income growth rates per capita, etc.) and perhaps other aggregate measures
          of competitiveness and political stability. Based on this a company can choose the most
          attractive country. However, Tarun Khanna and Krishna Palepu from Harvard Business School
          have shown that this may not be enough, especially not for emerging markets.23 These are
          often equally attractive on composite measures but may differ considerably on the specifics
          of institutional infrastructure. They emphasise that regulatory systems, contract-enforcing
          mechanisms, specialised intermediaries and other ‘soft’ infrastructure like the availability of
          market information need to be carefully evaluated. These kinds of institutional voids must
          then be taken into consideration when evaluating country attractiveness, besides composite
          country rankings.24 Illustration 9.3 describes a company for which institutions triumph all
          other international challenges.

                                                                                                         283
Chapter 9 International strategy


                       The PESTEL framework can thus be used here as it not only considers economic factors
                    but broader institutional ones as well. This suggests that at least four of its elements can be
                    of help in evaluating and comparing countries for entry:

                    • Political. Political environments vary widely between countries and can alter rapidly. Russia
                      since the fall of communism has seen frequent swings for and against private foreign
                      enterprise. It is important to determine the level of political risk before entering a country.
                      In the extreme case governments simply take over companies. For example, the Argen-
                      tinian government nationalised the Spanish oil company Repsol’s 57 per cent stake in
                      Argentina’s largest oil company and General Motor’s plant in Venezuela was seized by
                      the authorities. Governments can of course also create significant opportunities for organ-
                      isations. For example, the British government has traditionally promoted the financial
                      services industry in the City of London by offering tax advantages to high-earning finan-
                      ciers from abroad and providing a ‘light-touch’ regulatory environment.
                    • Economic. Key comparators in deciding entry are levels of gross domestic product and
                      disposable income that help in estimating the potential size of the market. Fast-growth
                      economies obviously provide opportunities, and in developing economies such as China
                      and India growth is translating into an even faster creation of a high-consumption middle
                      class. At the same time entirely new high-growth markets are opening up in Africa
                      including Nigeria and Ghana.
                    • Social. Social factors will clearly be important, for example the availability of a well-trained work-
                      force or the size of demographic market segments – old or young – relevant to the strategy.
                      Cultural variations also need to be considered, for instance in defining tastes in the marketplace.
                    • Legal. Countries vary widely in their legal regime, determining the extent to which busi-
                      nesses can enforce contracts, protect intellectual property or avoid corruption. Similarly,
                      policing will be important for the security of employees, a factor that in the past has
                      deterred business in some African countries.

                        Pankaj Ghemawat from Spain’s IESE Business School emphasises that what matters is
                    not just the attractiveness of different countries relative to each other, based on PESTEL
                    for example. He points out that the compatibility of the countries with the international-
                    ising firm itself and its country of origin is what really matters.25 Thus Ghemawat underlines
                    the importance of match between country and firm. For firms coming from any particular
                    country, some countries are more ‘distant’ – or mismatched – than others. For example, a
                    Spanish company might be ‘closer’ to a South American market than an East Asian market
                    and might therefore prefer that market even if it ranked lower on standard criteria of attract-
                    iveness. As well as a relative ranking of countries, therefore, each company has to add its
                    assessment of countries in terms of closeness of match.
                        Ghemawat’s ‘CAGE framework’ measures the match between countries and companies
                    according to four dimensions of distance, reflected by the letters of this acronym. Hence, the
                    CAGE framework emphasises the importance of cultural, administrative, geographical
                    and economic distance, as follows:

                    • Cultural distance. The distance dimension here relates to differences in language, ethnicity,
                      religion and social norms (see Section 6.3.1 for four key dimensions upon which national
                      cultures tend to differ). Cultural distance is not just a matter of similarity in consumer

                    • Administrative and political distance. Here distance is in terms of incompatible administra-
                      tive, political or legal traditions. Colonial ties can diminish difference, so that the shared
                      heritage of France and its former West African colonies creates certain understandings
                      that go beyond linguistic advantages. Institutional weaknesses or voids – for example,
                      slow or corrupt administration – can open up distance between countries. So too can
                      political differences: Chinese companies are increasingly able to operate in parts of the
                      world that American companies are finding harder, for example parts of Africa and the
                      Middle East.
                    • Geographical distance. This is not just a matter of the kilometres separating one country
                      from another, but involves other geographical characteristics of the country such as size,
                      sea access and the quality of communications infrastructure. Transport infrastructure can
                      shrink or exaggerate physical distance. France is much closer to large parts of Continental
                      Europe than to the United Kingdom thanks to its high-speed rail network and because of
                      the barrier presented by the English Channel and the latter’s relatively poor road and rail
                      infrastructure. Another example is the Brazilian mining company Vale, which has devel-
                      oped mega-ship carriers for its Chinese exports to limit the effect of geographic distances.
                    • Economic. The final element of the CAGE framework refers particularly to wealth distances.

  4 billion people beneath the poverty income threshold of less than $2 a day.27 Multi-
  nationals from rich countries are typically weak at serving such very poor consumers.
  However, these rich-country multinationals are losing out on large markets if they only
  concentrate on the wealthy elites overseas. C.K. Prahalad pointed out that the aggre-
  gated wealth of those at the ‘base of the pyramid’ in terms of income distribution is very
  substantial: simple mathematics means that those 4 billion below the poverty threshold
  represent a market of more than $2,000bn per year. If rich-country multinationals can
  develop new capabilities to serve these numerically huge markets, they can bridge the
  economic distance, and thereby both significantly extend their presence in booming
  economies such as China and India and bring to these poor consumers the benefits that
  are claimed for Western goods.28 See Illustration 9.4 for examples of innovative bases of
  pyramid strategies.



9.5.2 Competitive characteristics
Assessing the relative attractiveness of markets by PESTEL and CAGE analyses including
careful examinations of institutions is a significant first step. Thinking Differently at the end
of this chapter highlights the significance of institutions for market entry and selection and
considers an entirely new strategy view based on them. However, there is also a second
element, which relates to competition. Here, of course, Michael Porter’s Five Forces Frame-
work can help (see Section 3.3), but it is important to observe that an attractive industry in
the home market can be unattractive in another country. For example, country markets with
many existing competitors, powerful buyers (perhaps large retail chains such as in much of
North America and Europe) and low barriers to further new entrants from overseas would
typically be unattractive. An additional consideration is the likelihood of retaliation from
other competitors.
   In the Five Forces Framework, retaliation potential relates to rivalry and entry, but
managers can extend this by using insights directly from ‘game theory’ (see Section 7.3.2). It
takes competitor interdependence, including moves and countermoves, into consideration.
Here the likelihood and ferocity of potential competitor reactions are added to the simple
calculation of relative country market attractiveness. As in Figure 9.6, country markets can
be assessed according to three criteria:29

• Market attractiveness to the new entrant, based on PESTEL, CAGE and five forces analyses,
  for example. In Figure 9.6, countries A and B are the most attractive to the entrant.
• Defender’s reactiveness, likely to be influenced by the market’s attractiveness to the
  defender but also by the extent to which the defender is working with a globally inte-
  grated, rather than multi-domestic, strategy. A defender will be more reactive if the
  markets are important to it and it has the managerial capabilities to coordinate its
  response. Here, the defender is highly reactive in countries A and D.
• Defender’s clout, that is the power that the defender is able to muster in order to fight
  back. Clout is typically a function of share in the particular market, but might be influ-
  enced by connections to other powerful local players, such as retailers or government. In
  Figure 9.6, clout is represented by the size of the bubbles, with the defender having most
  clout in countries A, C, D and F.
Choice of country to enter can be significantly modified by adding reactiveness and clout
to calculations of attractiveness. Relying only on attractiveness, the top-ranked country to
enter in Figure 9.6 is country A. Unfortunately, it is also one in which the defender is highly
reactive, and the one in which it has most clout. Country B becomes a better international
move than A. In turn, country C is a better prospect than country D, because, even though

they are equally attractive, the defender is less reactive. One surprising result of taking
defender reactiveness and clout into account is the re-evaluation of country E: although
ranked fifth on simple attractiveness, it might rank second overall if competitor retaliation
is allowed for.
    This sort of analysis is particularly fruitful for considering the international moves of two
interdependent competitors, such as Unilever and Procter & Gamble or British Airways and
Singapore Airlines. In these cases the analysis is relevant to any aggressive strategic move, for
instance the expansion of existing operations in a country as well as initial entry.


9.5.3 Entry mode strategies
Once a particular national market has been selected for entry, an organisation needs to
choose how to enter that market. Entry mode strategies differ in the degree of resource
commitment to a particular market and the extent to which an organisation is oper-
ationally involved in a particular location. In order of increasing resource commitment, the
four key entry mode types are: exporting; contractual arrangement through licensing or fran-
chising to local partners; joint ventures with local companies, in other words the establishment
of jointly owned businesses; and wholly owned subsidiaries, through either the acquisition of
established companies or ‘greenfield’ investments; the development of facilities from scratch.
   This staged international expansion model emphasises the role of experience and learning
in determining entry mode strategy. Internationalisation typically brings organisations into
unfamiliar territory, requiring managers to learn new ways of doing business.30 The staged
international expansion model proposes a sequential process whereby companies grad-
ually increase their commitment to newly entered markets, as they build knowledge
and capabilities. Thus firms might enter initially by exporting or licensing, thereby acquiring


                                                                                                                   289

                    some local knowledge while minimising local investments. As they gain knowledge and
                    confidence, firms can then increase their exposure, perhaps first by a joint venture and finally
                    by creating a wholly owned subsidiary. For example, the leading Danish wind turbine manu-
                    facturer Vestas first entered the US market through exports. Subsequently Vestas established
                    manufacturing and R&D facilities in Eastern Colorado to strengthen its competitive posi-
                    tion versus domestic players and now supplies 90 per cent of components required for the
                    assembly of a final turbine within the USA.
                       There are advantages and disadvantages for each entry mode strategy depending on a
                    range of factors including resource and investment requirements, control, risks, transport
                    costs, trade barriers, entry speed, etc. Table 9.1 lists some of these fundamental factors that
                    can help guide managers in choosing between market entry modes, but case-specific factors
                    need to be considered:

                    • Export is the baseline option and has the advantage of requiring relatively less resources
                      and risks while offering speedy entry and possibilities to fully exploit production economies
                      in prevailing facilities. However, a potential disadvantage is of course transportation costs
                      and the possibility that products can be manufactured cheaper locally. Limited control of
                      marketing and sales and possible international trade barriers are other drawbacks.
                    • Licensing or franchising involves a contractual agreement whereby a local firm receives the
                      right to exploit a product technology or a service concept commercially for a fee during
                      a specific time period. Soft-drink companies like Coca-Cola use license agreements for
                      its drinks and brands internationally and fast food chains like McDonald’s use franchise
                      arrangements. Resource commitments can be kept low as local partners bear the primary
                      financial and political risks while entry can be relatively quick. The main disadvantage with
                      this entry mode is potential lack of control over technologies and product and service
                      quality plus a possible risk of technological leakage and poor quality.
                    • Joint ventures are jointly owned companies where the international investor shares assets,
                      equity and risk with a local partner. This implies that resource and financial commitments
                      are limited compared to full ownership, and financial and political risks are also reduced.
                      Another advantage is the ability to build on the local partner’s knowledge of customer
                      needs and local institutions. In some countries, China for example, joint ventures may be
                      the only option for foreign investors in certain sectors. An important drawback, however,
                      is the risk of losing control over technologies to the partner even if agreements can be
                      made to lower this risk. Another disadvantage is disagreements and conflicts between the
                      partners when the joint venture evolves and changes over time. Companies balance the
                      trade-offs between these advantages and disadvantages in different ways. For example,
                      Sweden’s heavy truck maker Volvo has set up joint ventures in China while its compet-
                      itor Scania, also headquartered in Sweden, has decided not to enter into Chinese joint
                      ventures due to the risk of losing control of its technological expertise.
                    • Wholly owned subsidiaries involve 100 per cent control through setting up entirely new
                      greenfield operations or by acquiring a local firm. This entry mode has the advantage
                      of giving the company strong control over technologies, operations, sales and finan-
                      cial results. It also allows for exploiting production and coordination economies among
                      diverse units globally. On the negative side this mode of entry involves substantial
                      resource commitments and costs besides risks for larger firms even though the latter
                      can be lowered somewhat if acquiring a local company (but acquisitions involve their
                      own challenges; see Section 11.5.2). Acquisitions are a common entry mode in the auto
                      industry including a whole range of acquisitions during the last decade from Chinese
                      Geely’s acquisition of Volvo Cars to Indian Tata Motors’ acquisition of Jaguar and Land
                      Rover to Italian Fiat’s mega acquisition of Chrysler.

   Other case-specific factors are also liable to enter the calculation of appropriate entry
mode besides those discussed above and displayed in Table 9.1. For example, if global
coordination of various value chain and system activities across different countries is essential,
wholly owned subsidiaries would be the principal entry mode. Entry mode choice and char-
acteristics of course also depend on company size. Entry speed for small and medium-sized
companies, for example, may be rather quick through a wholly owned mode if a small local
unit is set up or acquired (see below).
   It should now be clear that each entry mode strategy involves important trade-offs
between various factors and managers need to carefully consider the specific situation and
context when trying to choose the optimal entry mode. For example, if entering an entirely
new and unknown market a joint venture may be preferable as a local partner could provide
valuable market and institutional knowledge. However, if the international investor’s prod-
ucts build on unique and patented technologies and the ability to enforce contracts and
protect intellectual property is weak, a wholly owned subsidiary may still be the wiser choice.
   The gradualism of staged international expansion outlined above has, however, recently
been challenged by two phenomena:

• ‘Born-global firms’ are new small firms that internationalise rapidly at early stages in their
  development.31 New technologies now help small firms swiftly link up to international
  sources of expertise, supply and customers worldwide. For such firms, waiting till they
  have enough international experience is not an option: international strategy is a condi-
  tion of existence. For example, companies such as Instagram and Spotify internationalised
  quickly from being small start-ups. The early, rapid internationalisation of born-global
  firms are common today and it is estimated that some 20 per cent of new enterprises in
  Europe belong to the born-global category.32 Other types of companies may also inter-
  nationalise fast. Blue Skies in Illustration 9.2 with operations across three continents is an
  example of a small company that started out as a mini-multinational.
• Emerging-country multinationals also often move quickly through entry modes. Prominent
  examples are the Chinese white-goods multinational Haier, the Indian pharmaceuticals
  company Ranbaxy Laboratories and Mexico’s Cemex cement company mentioned
  above.33 Such companies typically develop unique capabilities in their home market that
  then need to be rolled out quickly worldwide before competitors catch up. For example,
  Haier became skilled at very efficient production of simple white goods, providing a
  cost advantage that is transferable outside its Chinese manufacturing base. Haier now
  has factories in Italy and the USA, as well as the Philippines, Malaysia, Indonesia, Egypt,
  Nigeria and elsewhere round the world. The rapid internationalisation made by emerging
  multinationals from China has largely been based on acquisitions.34 These are often high

                       movie theatre chain in the USA, AMC and the Hollywood film studio Legendary (see end
                       case example).




9.6 Subsidiary roles in an international portfolio
                    International strategies imply different relationships between subsidiary operations and the
                    corporate centre. The complexity of the strategies followed by organisations such as General
                    Electric or Unilever can result in highly differentiated networks of subsidiaries with a range
                    of distinct strategic roles.35 Subsidiaries may play different roles according to the level of
                    local resources and capabilities available to them and the strategic importance of their local
                    environment. Corporate headquarters can assign these roles, but subsidiaries sometimes also
                    take on roles more independently (see Figure 9.7):36

                    • Strategic leaders are subsidiaries that not only hold valuable resources and capabilities, but
                      are also located in countries that are crucial for competitive success because of, for example,
                      the size of the local market or the accessibility of key technologies. Japanese and Euro-
                      pean subsidiaries in the USA often play this role. Subsidiaries are seen as playing important
                      strategic roles with entrepreneurial potential for the whole multinational organisation.37
                      Subsidiaries and subunits are thus either assigned strategic roles or take autonomous stra-
                      tegic initiatives. Hewlett Packard, for example, is known to have used both approaches.38
                    • Contributors are subsidiaries located in countries of lesser strategic significance, but with
                      sufficiently valuable internal capabilities to nevertheless play key roles in a multinational
                      organisation’s competitive success. The Australian subsidiary of the Swedish telecommu-
                      nications firm Ericsson played such a role in developing specialised mobile phone systems.

          • Implementers, though not contributing substantially to the enhancement of a firm’s
            competitive advantage, are important in the sense that they help generate vital financial
            resources. In this sense, they are similar to the ‘cash cows’ of the Boston Consulting Group
            matrix, but the danger is that they turn into the equivalent of ‘dogs’ (see Figure 8.6).
          • Black holes are subsidiaries located in countries that are crucial for competitive success but
            with low-level resources or capabilities. This is a position many subsidiaries of American
            and European firms found themselves in over long periods in Japan. They have some of
            the characteristics of ‘question marks’ in the Boston Consulting Group matrix, requiring
            heavy investment (like an astrophysicist’s ‘black hole,’ sucking matter in).



9.7 Internationalisation and performance
          Just as for product and service diversity discussed in Section 8.4 the relationship between
          internationalisation and performance has been extensively researched.39 Some of the main
          findings are as follows:

          • An inverted U-curve. While the potential performance benefits of internationalisation are
            substantial, in that it allows firms to realise economies of scale and scope and benefit from
            the locational advantages available in countries around the globe, the combination of
            diverse locations and diverse business units also gives rise to high levels of organisational
            complexity. At some point, the costs of organisational complexity may exceed the benefits of
            internationalisations. Accordingly, theory, and the balance of evidence, suggest an inverted
            U-shaped relationship between internationalisation and performance (similar to the findings
            on product/service diversification shown in Section 8.4), with moderate levels of interna-
            tionalisation leading to the best results. However, Yip’s research on large British companies
            suggests that managers may be getting better at internationalisation, with substantially
            internationalised firms actually seeing performance improving to the point where interna-
            tional sales are above 40 per cent of total sales.40 Experience and commitment to interna-
            tionalisation may be able to deliver strong performance for highly internationalised firms.
          • Service-sector disadvantages. A number of studies have suggested that, in contrast to
            firms in the manufacturing sector, internationalisation may not lead to equally improved
            performance for service-sector firms. There are three possible reasons for such an effect.
            First, the operations of foreign service firms in some sectors (such as accountants or banks)
            remain tightly regulated and restricted in many countries; second, due to the intangible
            nature of services, they are often more sensitive to cultural differences and require greater
            adaptation than manufactured products which may lead to higher initial learning costs;
            third, the services typically require a significant local presence and reduce the scope for
            the exploitation of economies of scale in production compared to manufacturing firms.41
          • Internationalisation and product diversity. An important question to consider is the inter-
            action between internationalisation and product/service diversification. Compared to
            single-business firms it has been suggested that product-diversified firms are likely to do
            better from international expansion because they have already developed the necessary
            skills and structures for managing internal diversity.42 At the other end of the spectrum there
            is general consensus that firms that are highly diversified in terms of both product and inter-
            national markets are likely to face excessive costs of coordination and control leading to poor
            performance. As many firms have not yet reached levels of internationalisation where nega-
            tive effects outweigh possible gains and because of current scepticism with regard to the
            benefits of high levels of product diversification, many companies currently opt for reducing
            their product diversity while building their international scope. Unilever, for example, has
            been combining a strategy of growing internationalisation with de-diversification.

Thinking differently                          An institution-based view of strategy
A new strategy view focused on institutions rather than competition and capabilities
has been proposed.

                       Summary
                       • Internationalisation potential in any particular market is determined by Yip’s four drivers
                         of internationalisation: market, cost, government and competitors’ strategies.
                       • Besides firm-specific advantages there are geographic sources of advantage in international
                         strategy that can be drawn from both national sources of advantage, as captured in
                         Porter’s Diamond, and global sourcing through the international value system.
                       • There are four main types of international strategy, varying according to the extent of
                         coordination and geographical configuration: export strategy, multi-domestic strategy,
                         global strategy and transnational strategy.
                       • Market selection for international entry or expansion should be based on attractiveness,
                         institutional voids, multi-dimensional measures of distance and expectations of competitor
                         retaliation.
                       • Entry mode strategies into new markets include export, licensing and franchising, joint
                         ventures and wholly owned subsidiaries.
                       • Subsidiaries in an international firm can be managed by portfolio methods just like busi-
                         nesses in a diversified firm.
                       • Internationalisation has an uncertain relationship to financial performance, with an
                         inverted U-curve warning against over-internationalisation.

                        9.1    Using Figure 9.2 (internationalisation drivers), compare two markets you are familiar
                               with and analyse how strong each of the drivers is for increased international
                               strategy.
                        9.2    Visit the websites of the following companies and try to plot their international
                               strategies in one of the four international strategy types of Figure 9.4 (each company
                               primarily fits one strategy): Nestlé, ABB, Louis Vuitton and Lenovo.
                        9.3    Using the CAGE framework (Section 9.5.1), assess the relative ‘distance’ of the USA,
                               China, India and France for a British company (or a company from a country of your
                               choice).
                        9.4    Using the diverse modes of international market entry of Figure 9.7 classify the entry
                               mode of H&M*, Teva* or AB InBev (Megabrew* case) or any other multinational
                               corporation with which you are familiar.
                        9.5    Critically evaluate the suggestion that globalisation is mostly beneficial for
                               companies.
                        9.6    Take any part of the public or not-for-profit sector (e.g. education, health) and
                               explain how far internationalisation has affected its management and consider how
                               far it may do so in the future.

                        9.7    As in Section 9.2, use the four international strategies of Figure 9.4 to classify the
                               international strategy of H&M* or AB InBev (Megabrew* case) or any other multi-
                               national corporation with which you are familiar. Drawing on Section 13.2.4, how
                               does this corporation’s organisational structure fit (or not fit) this strategy?

10.1 Introduction
          As discussed in Chapter 1 strategy concerns an organisation’s long-term direction and one
          important dimension of this is to create new value and competitive advantages for the future.
          Organisations need not only build competitive advantages in relation to current domestic
          and international competitors, but they need to identify growth opportunities for the future.
          Hence, this chapter is about identifying opportunities and creating new products and services,
          technologies, resources and capabilities. This is significant both for start-ups in new indus-
          tries and for established organisations in mature ones. For example, Apple needs to sustain
          and develop their existing competitive advantages not only with iPhone upgrades, but they
          also need to find new opportunities in the market, as with the HomePod, Apple watch and
          AirPods.
             Strategic entrepreneurship combines strategy and entrepreneurship and includes both
          advantage-seeking strategy activities and opportunity-seeking entrepreneurial activities
          to create value.1 While strategy supports this by forming competitive advantages, entrepren-
          eurship contributes the identification of new opportunities in the market or environment. The
          latter involves entrepreneurs that innovate by identifying and exploiting new ideas and inven-
          tions that result in innovations. Strategic entrepreneurship and its outcome, innovation, are
          thus essential for the long-term survival and success of all organisations and it is the focus of
          this chapter.2
             Entrepreneurship and one of its most central ingredients and outcomes, innovation, are
          fundamental not only for creating value for customers, organisational growth and prosperity,
          but also generally for today’s economy. All businesses start with an act of entrepreneurship,
          but large established firms also practise entrepreneurship to find new innovative products
          and services. This is termed corporate entrepreneurship or ‘intrapreneurship’, whereas
          pursuing a public good may be termed ‘social entrepreneurship’. Innovation is also a key
          aspect of business-level strategy and models, as introduced in Chapter 7, with implications for
          cost, price, differentiation and sustained competitive advantage. Moreover, it is a dynamic cap-
          ability that can renew organisational resources and capabilities as discussed in Chapter 4.
             Promoting greater innovation and entrepreneurship is thus crucial to the improvement
          of all firms and public services. However, it also poses hard choices. For example, how can
          new and valuable opportunities be identified and what are the essential considerations
          involved? Should a company always look to be a pioneer in new technologies, or rather be
          a fast follower such as Samsung typically is? How should a company react to radical innova-
          tions that threaten to destroy their existing revenues? The chapter thus focuses particularly
          on the choices involved in entrepreneurship and innovation aimed at creating new value that
          benefits organisations and society. Figure 10.1 identifies four major themes of this chapter.
          Within this framework, this chapter will first examine entrepreneurship then innovation:

Chapter 10 Entrepreneurship and innovation


                   • Section 10.2 addresses entrepreneurship. The section starts with a discussion of a central
                     step in strategic entrepreneurship, opportunity recognition, which captures conditions
                     under which products and services satisfy market needs or wants in the environment.
                     Other steps in the entrepreneurial process then follow. They provide a foundation for
                     further entrepreneurial growth stages from start-up to growth, maturity and possibly
                     finally to exit. Finally, this section introduces social entrepreneurship, which explains how
                     individuals and small groups can launch innovative and flexible new initiatives that larger
                     public agencies are unable to pursue.
                   • Section 10.3 discusses three fundamental innovation dilemmas: technology push as against
                     market pull; product innovation rather than process innovation; and, finally, open versus
                     closed innovation including the importance of ecosystems for the former. None of these
                     are absolute ‘either-or’ dilemmas, but managers and entrepreneurs must choose where
                     to concentrate their limited resources.
                   • Once created, innovations will be diffused among users over time and diffusion pace
                     depends on various product and demand features. Section 10.4 considers issues
                     surrounding the diffusion, or spread, of innovations in the marketplace. Diffusion processes
                     often follow S-curve patterns, raising further typical issues for decision, particularly with
                     regard to tipping points and tripping points.
                   • Section 10.5 completes the discussion of innovation by considering choices with regard
                     to timing. This includes first-mover innovation advantages and disadvantages, the advan-
                     tages of being ‘fast second’ into a market, and the issue of how established incumbents
                     can be innovative and respond to innovative challengers.




10.2 Entrepreneurship
                   Understanding and developing competitive positions and competitive advantages in rela-
                   tion to current competitors and in existing resources and capabilities is fundamental for
                   the long-term strategic direction of an organisation. However, all organisations also need
                   to renew their strategies more fundamentally and explore entirely new opportunities and
                   competitive strategies for the future. This suggests that organisations also need to be entre-
                   preneurial. Entrepreneurship is a process by which individuals, start-ups or organisations
                   identify and exploit opportunities for new products or services that satisfy a need in
                   a market.3 Recognising an opportunity is the very first step in a strategic entrepreneurial
                   process. It is more than a simple business idea and involves a combination of elements
                   that an entrepreneur believes will create value and possibly profit. This section introduces
                   some key issues for entrepreneurial innovators including opportunity recognition and the
                   entrepreneurial process. It emphasises some of the challenges of entrepreneurship, the
                   way ventures tend to evolve through various growth stages and concludes by considering
                   social entrepreneurs.


                   10.2.1 Opportunity recognition
                   Opportunity recognition means recognising an opportunity, i.e. circumstances under
                   which products and services can satisfy a need in the market or environment and is
                   central for any form of strategic entrepreneurship whether by small start-up-, corporate- or
                   social entrepreneurs.4 This involves an entrepreneur or entrepreneurial team identifying
                   trends in the environment and combining resources and capabilities into the creation of new

products or services. Opportunity recognition thus involves three important and interdepen-
dent elements: the entrepreneur or entrepreneurial team, the environment and resources
and capabilities (see Figure 10.2):

• Entrepreneur or entrepreneurial team. The entrepreneur or team drives and integrates
  the various parts of an entrepreneurial process including scanning and spotting trends
  in the environment (see Section 2.2), linking these to existing resources and capabilities
  (see Chapter 4) or acquiring appropriate ones and recombining them. Entrepreneurs
  come in many different forms and shapes. However, they are often alert to opportunities
  and able to deal with uncertainty, willing to take risks, highly motivated, optimistic and
  persuasive as they coordinate resources from their social networks. Entrepreneurship,
  however, normally includes a team and the managing of relationships with other partners
  and sometimes other and bigger companies (see Illustration 10.1).
• Environment trends and marketplace gaps. Building on macro trends and possible market-
  place gaps is likely to be central in identifying an opportunity. This includes observing
  economic, technological, social and political trends (as with PESTEL; see Section 2.2) and
  linking them to specific customer needs that are currently not satisfied. Spotting macro
  trends, industry and strategic group analysis and Blue Ocean thinking can be very useful
  for identifying new market opportunities (see Sections 2.2, 3.2 and 3.4.3). For example,
  the GPS fitness-tracking app Runkeeper, with over 50 million users, built on health aware-
  ness and fitness trends, the proliferation of smartphones users and apps, globalisation
  of markets and the increased possibility to integrate apps across various social media
  platforms like Facebook and Twitter. It addresses the market gap of runners’ needs to be
  able to track and engage with their progress.
• Resources and capabilities. Having access to or being able to obtain resources and capabil-
  ities are an important part of opportunity recognition. Various helpful ways of mapping
  and evaluating them were discussed in Chapter 4 (VRIO, value chain, activity systems, etc.;
  see Sections 4.3, 4.4.2 and 4.4.3). For small start-ups the necessary resources and capabil-
  ities frequently arise from and draw upon the knowledge and experiences and compe-
  tences of the people involved (see Illustration 10.1). However, while existing resources and
  capabilities can be helpful they can also be harmful for opportunity recognition, especially
  for larger established organisations. Incumbent companies are always bound by existing

and external relationships.

   resources and capabilities, activities and vested interests, which can make entrepreneurial
   behaviours and activities very difficult (see Section 6.4). Given this, many would conclude
   that the best approach for entrepreneurship is to start up a new venture from scratch.
   Independent entrepreneurs such as the Samwer brothers of Rocket Internet, and Larry
   Page and Sergey Brin of Google are exemplars of this entrepreneurial approach (see Chap-
   ters 4 and 13 end cases).



10.2.2 Steps in the entrepreneurial process
The first step of opportunity recognition explained above is likely to be followed by five other
steps in the development of an entrepreneurial venture (see Figure 10.3 for an overview of
these steps).5 Before developing a business plan (see Section 13.2.2) an entrepreneur and
start-up can usefully include an initial feasibility analysis (see Chapter 12). This would critically
assess an entrepreneurial idea in terms of product or service viability, market opportunity and
financing to establish if it can be turned into a business at all. Next, industry conditions and
competitors are often considered. Competitive positions can be evaluated with the help of
five forces and strategic groups analyses (see Sections 3.2 and 3.4) and competitors’ potential
to imitate the venture’s resources and capabilities can be examined with the VRIO analysis
(see Section 4.3). One of the most important considerations in the entrepreneurial process is
to choose a business model and strategy (see Chapter 7).6 A start-up thus needs to consider
how to create value for the customers, how to manage revenues and costs, how to generate
a margin and whether to build on an established business model or create a new one. In
addition to this a distinct competitive strategy position and advantage need to be identified.
Thus entrepreneurs will typically have to choose between the generic business strategies
of differentiation, cost and focus or any possible hybrid strategy (see Section 7.2). Finally,
the new venture’s financial strength in terms of financing and funding need to be carefully
examined (see Chapter 12).
   While these entrepreneurial process steps are important it must be noted that it is an
iterative rather than sequential process and thus not necessarily quite as simple as indi-
cated by Figure 10.3 (see also Thinking Differently at the end of this chapter). The steps
do not necessarily neatly follow on from each other and typically include setbacks along

                   the way. The process thus often involves continuous experimentation and the original
                   business itself may evolve quite radically. This is sometimes referred to as a ‘pivoting’,
                   which means making major changes in some dimension of the venture based on market
                   and external feedback.7 For example, Starbucks started off in 1971 selling espresso makers
                   and coffee beans rather than brewed coffee. It was after a visit to Italy in 1983 that entre-
                   preneur Howard Schultz (former chairman, president and CEO) started to brew and sell
                   Starbucks coffee in the first coffeehouse. At this time, however, it was a European-style
                   coffeehouse with classical music and waiters, completely different to the Starbucks café it
                   eventually became. The important role of experimentation or pivoting also suggests that
                   many entrepreneurs will fail. For every revolutionary entrepreneur that has recognised
                   new opportunities, created new markets and beaten off well-resourced challengers, like
                   Starbucks’ Howard Schultz, there are countless forgotten failures (see Illustration 10.2 for
                   an example). No matter how the entrepreneurial process develops or the degree of experi-
                   mentation and set-backs, ventures develop through diverse growth stages, and this is
                   discussed next.


                   10.2.3 Stages of entrepreneurial growth
                   Entrepreneurial ventures are often seen as going through four stages of a life cycle (see
                   Figure 10.4). The entrepreneurial life cycle progresses through start-up, growth, maturity
                   and exit. Of course, most ventures do not make it through all the stages – the estimated
                   failure rate of new businesses in their first year is more than one-fifth, with two-thirds going
                   out of business within six years.8 However, each of these four stages raises key questions for
                   entrepreneurs:

                   • Start-up. There are many challenges at this stage, but one key question with implica-
                     tions for both survival and growth is sources of capital. Loans from family and friends are
                     common sources of funds, but these are typically limited and, given the new-business
                     failure rate, likely to lead to embarrassment. Bank loans and credit cards can provide
                     funding too, and there is often government funding especially for new technologies or
                     economically disadvantaged social groups or geographical areas. Venture capitalists are
                     specialised investors in new ventures and usually insist on a seat on the venture’s board
                     of directors and may install their preferred managers. Venture capitalist backing has been
                     shown to significantly increase the chances of a venture’s success, but they typically accept
                     only about one in 400 propositions put to them.

Chapter 10 Entrepreneurship and innovation


                   • Growth. A key challenge for growth is management. Entrepreneurs have to be ready to
                     move from ‘doing’ to ‘managing’. Typically this transition occurs as the venture grows
                     beyond about 20 employees. Many entrepreneurs make poor managers: if they had
                     wanted to be managers, they would probably be working in a large corporation in
                     the first place. The choice entrepreneurs have to make is whether to rely on their own
                     managerial skills or to bring in professional managers. Groupon’s founder Andrew Mason
                     had to step down as chief executive in 2013 after creating one of the first unicorns ever
                     (see Illustration 4.3).
                   • Maturity. The challenge for entrepreneurs at this stage is retaining their enthusiasm and
                     commitment and generating new growth. This is a period when entrepreneurship can
                     change to intrapreneurship, the generation of new ventures from inside the organisation
                     (see Section 10.5.2). An important option is usually diversification into new business areas,
                     a topic dealt with in Chapter 8. Amazon has moved from book-selling to groceries and
                     clothing and further into a platform for other merchants. It is critical to recall the odds on
                     success at this stage as research suggests that many small high-tech firms fail to manage
                     the transition to a second generation of technology, and that it is often better at this point
                     simply to look for exit.9
                   • Exit. Exit refers to departure from the venture, either by the founding entrepreneurs, or
                     by the original investors, or both. At the point of exit, entrepreneurs and venture capital-
                     ists will seek to release capital as a reward for their input and risk-taking. Entrepreneurs
                     may consider three prime routes to exit. A simple trade sale of the venture to another
                     company is a common route. In 2014 the founders of the internet-based mobile texting
                     app WhatsApp sold their company to Facebook for $16bn, just four years after starting.
                     Another exit route for highly successful enterprises is an initial public offering (IPO), the
                     sale of shares to the public. IPOs usually involve just a portion of the total shares avail-
                     able, and may thus allow entrepreneurs to continue in the business and provide funds
                     for further growth. In 2012, Mark Zuckerberg raised $16bn in Facebook’s IPO, while
                     retaining for himself 28 per cent ownership of the company. It is often said that good
                     entrepreneurs plan for their exit right from start-up, and certainly venture capitalists will
                     insist on this.

                      Entrepreneurs who have successfully exited a first venture often become serial entrepre-
                   neurs. They are people who set up a succession of enterprises, investing the capital raised
                   on exit from earlier ventures into new growing ventures. For example, the German Samwer
                   brothers of Rocket Internet have started and sold a whole series of companies and then
                   started new ones (see Chapter 4 end case).


                   10.2.4 Social entrepreneurship
                   Entrepreneurship is not just a matter for the private sector. The public sector has seen
                   increasing calls for a more entrepreneurial approach to service creation and delivery.
                   The notion of social entrepreneurship has become common. Social entrepreneurs are
                   individuals and groups who create independent organisations to mobilise ideas and
                   resources to address social problems, typically earning revenues but on a not-for-
                   profit basis. Independence and revenues generated in the market give social entrepre-
                   neurs the flexibility and dynamism to pursue social problems that pure public-sector
                   organisations are often too bureaucratic, or too politically constrained, to tackle. Social
                   entrepreneurs have pursued a wide range of initiatives, including small loans (‘micro-
                   credit’) to peasants by the Grameen bank in Bangladesh, employment creation by the

          Mondragon cooperative in the Basque region of Spain, and fair trade by Traidcraft in the
          United Kingdom. This wide range of initiatives raises at least three key choices for social
          entrepreneurs.

          • Social mission. For social entrepreneurs, the social mission is primary. The social mission
            can embrace two elements: end objectives and operational processes. For example, the
            Grameen bank has the end objective of reducing rural poverty, especially for women. The
            process is empowering poor people’s own business initiatives by providing micro-credit
            at a scale and to people that conventional banks would ignore.
          • Organisational form. Many social enterprises take on cooperative forms, involving their
            employees and other stakeholders on a democratic basis and thus building commitment
            and channels for ideas. This form of organisation raises the issue of which stakeholders
            to include, and which to exclude. Cooperatives can also be slow to take hard decisions.
            Social enterprises therefore sometimes take more hierarchical charity or company forms
            of organisation. Cafédirect, the fair-trade beverages company, even became a publicly
            listed company, paying its first dividend to shareholders in 2006.
          • Business model. Social enterprises typically rely to a large extent on revenues earned in
            the marketplace, not just government subsidy or charitable donations. Housing associ-
            ations collect rents, micro-credit organisations charge interest and fair-trade organisa-
            tions sell produce. Social entrepreneurs are no different to other entrepreneurs, there-
            fore, in having to design an efficient and effective business model (see Section 7.4). This
            business model might involve innovative changes in the value chain. Thus fair-trade
            organisations have often become much more closely involved with their suppliers than
            commercial organisations, for example advising farmers on agriculture and providing
            education and infrastructure support to their communities.

             Social entrepreneurs, just like other entrepreneurs, often have to forge relationships
          with large commercial companies. Harvard Business School’s Rosabeth Moss Kanter
          points out that the benefits to large companies can go beyond a feel-good factor and
          attractive publicity. She shows that involvement in social enterprise can help develop
          new technologies and services, access new pools of potential employees, and create
          relationships with government and other agencies that can eventually turn into new
          markets.



10.3 Innovation dilemmas
          One important ingredient and outcome of entrepreneurship is innovation. It is of import-
          ance not only for start-ups, but for all firms, including large companies that continuously
          need to develop new and innovative products and services to successfully compete. Inno-
          vation is more complex than just invention. Invention involves the conversion of new know-
          ledge into a new product, process or service. Innovation involves the conversion of new
          knowledge into a new product, process or service and the putting of this new product,
          process or service into actual commercial use.10 Innovation, however, raises fundamental
          strategic dilemmas for strategists that stem from this extended process. Strategists have
          to make choices with regard to three fundamental issues: how far to follow technological
          opportunity as against market demand; how much to invest in product innovation rather
          than process innovation and how far to open themselves up to innovative ideas from
          outside.11




                                                                                                   311
Chapter 10 Entrepreneurship and innovation


                   10.3.1 Technology push or market pull
                   People often see innovation as driven by technology. In the pure version of this technology
                   push view, it is the new knowledge created by technologists or scientists that pushes
                   the innovation process. Research and development laboratories produce new products,
                   processes or services and then hand them over to the rest of the organisation to manu-
                   facture, market and distribute. According to this push perspective, managers should listen
                   primarily to their scientists and technologists, let them follow their hunches and support
                   them with ample resources. Generous R&D budgets are crucial to making innovation
                   happen. For example, estimates for making a new drug show that the costs can be as high
                   as $200m (£120m, €150m).
                      An alternative approach to innovation is market pull. Market pull reflects a view of innova-
                   tion that goes beyond invention and sees the importance of actual use. In many sectors users,
                   not producers, are common sources of important innovations. In designing their innovation
                   strategies, therefore, organisations should listen in the first place to users rather than their own
                   scientists and technologists. There are two prominent but contrasting approaches to market pull:

                   • Lead users: according to MIT professor Eric Von Hippel, in many markets it is lead users
                     who are the principal source of innovation.12 In medical surgery, top surgeons often
                     adapt existing surgical instruments in order to carry out new types of operation. In
                     extreme sports such as snowboarding or windsurfing, it is leading sportspeople who
                     make the improvements necessary for greater performance. In this view, then, it is the
                     pull of market experts that is responsible for innovation. Managers need to build close
                     relationships with lead users such as the best surgeons or sporting champions. Marketing
                     and sales functions identify the lead users of a field and then scientists and technologists
                     translate their inventive ideas into commercial products, processes or services that the
                     wider market can use. For example, the Danish toy company Lego runs a special ‘Ambas-
                     sador Program’ to keep close to 150 specialised user groups around the world; specialist
                     users in design and architecture were responsible for originating the Lego Jewellery and
                     Lego Architecture ranges.
                   • Frugal innovation: at the other end of the user continuum is the pull exerted by ordinary
                     consumers, particularly the poor in emerging markets.13 Rather than the expensive
                     research-intensive model of the traditional technology push approach, frugality is the
                     guiding principle here. Frugal innovation involves sensitivity to poor people’s real needs.
                     Responding not only to these users’ lack of money, but also to the tough conditions in
                     which they live, frugal innovation typically emphasises low cost, simplicity, robustness
                     and easy maintenance. The Tata Nano car is a famous example, a simple car produced for
                     the Indian market for only $2,000. Muruganatham’s cheap sanitary towels are another
                     example, this time emphasising opportunities to create employment for the economically
                     disadvantaged too (see Illustration 10.3).

                   The lead user and frugal innovation approaches are opposite ends of a spectrum, one elitist,
                   the other basic. Many organisations will choose somewhere in between. But fundamentally
                   both approaches share a key insight: innovations do not just come from scientific research,
                   but can be pulled by users in the external market.
                      There are merits to both the technology push and market pull views. Relying heavily on
                   existing users can make companies too conservative and vulnerable to disruptive technol-
                   ogies that uncover needs unforeseen by existing markets (see Section 10.5.2). On the other
                   hand, history is littered with examples of companies that have blindly pursued technological
                   excellence without regard to real market needs. Technology push and market pull are best
                   seen as extreme views, therefore helping to focus attention on a fundamental choice:
                   relatively how much to rely on science and technology as sources of innovation, rather than

                   what people are actually doing in the marketplace. The key is to manage the balance actively.
                   For a stagnant organisation looking for radical innovation, it might be worth redeploying
                   effort from whichever model currently predominates: for the technology push organisation
                   to use more market pull or for the market pull organisation to invest more in fundamental
                   research.


                   10.3.2 Product or process innovation
                   Just as managers must manage the balance between technology and market pull, so must
                   they determine the relative emphasis to place on product or process innovation. Product
                   innovation relates to the final product (or service) to be sold, especially with regard to its
                   features; process innovation relates to the way in which this product is produced and distrib-
                   uted, especially with regard to improvements in cost or reliability. Some firms specialise more
                   in product innovation, others more in process innovation. For example, in computers, Apple
                   has generally concentrated its efforts on designing attractive product features (for instance,
                   the iPad tablet), while Dell has innovated in terms of efficient processes, for instance direct
                   sales, modularity and build-to-order. Dell’s process innovation even underlies a different
                   business model compared to the competitors; selling a differentiated customised product
                   with after-sales services. Business model innovation is still another form of innovation and
                   thus involves reorganising value creation, configuration and capture into an entirely new
                   business model (see Section 7.4).14
                      The relative importance of product innovation and process innovation typically changes as
                   industries evolve over time.15 Usually the first stages of an industry are dominated by product
                   innovation based on new features. Thus the early history of the automobile was dominated
                   by competition as to whether cars should be fuelled by steam, electricity or petrol, have their
                   engines at the front or at the rear, and have three wheels or four.16 Industries eventually coalesce
                   around a dominant design, the standard configuration of basic features: after Henry Ford’s 1908
                   Model T, cars generally became petrol-driven, with their engines at the front and four wheels.
                   Once such a dominant design is established, innovation switches to process innovation, as
                   competition shifts to producing the dominant design as efficiently as possible. Henry Ford’s
                   great process innovation was the moving assembly line, introduced in 1913. Finally, the cycle is
                   liable to start again, as some significant innovation challenges the dominant design: in the case
                   of cars, recently the emergence of electric powered cars with forerunners like Toyota and Tesla.
                      Figure 10.5 provides a general model of the relationship between product and process
                   innovation over time. The model has several strategic implications:

                   • New developing industries typically favour product innovation, as competition is still
                     around defining the basic features of the product or service.
                   • Maturing industries typically favour process innovation, as competition shifts towards effi-
                     cient production of a dominant design of product or service.
                   • Small new entrants typically have the greatest opportunity when dominant designs are
                     either not yet established or beginning to collapse. Thus, in the early stages of the auto-
                     mobile industry, before Ford’s Model T, there were more than a hundred mostly small
                     competitors, each with its own combination of product features. The recent challenge
                     to the petrol-based dominant design has provided opportunities to entrepreneurial
                     companies such as the Californian start-up Tesla Motors.
                   • Large incumbent firms typically have the advantage during periods of dominant design
                     stability, when scale economies and the ability to roll out process innovations matter most.
                     With the success of the Model T and the assembly line, by the 1930s there were just four
                     large American automobile manufacturers, namely Ford, General Motors, Chrysler and
                     American Motors, all producing very similar kinds of cars.

This sequence of product to process innovation is not always a neat one. In practice, product
and process innovation are often pursued in tandem.17 For example, each new generation
of microprocessor also requires simultaneous process innovation in order to manufacture
the new microprocessor with increasing precision. However, the model does help managers
confront the issue of where to focus, whether more on product features or more on process
efficiency. It also points to whether competitive advantage is likely to be with small new
entrants or large incumbent firms. Other things being equal, small start-ups should time
their entry for periods of instability in dominant design and focus on product rather than
process innovation.


10.3.3 Open or closed innovation
The traditional approach to innovation has been to rely on the organisation’s own internal
resources – its laboratories and marketing departments. Innovation in this approach is
secretive, anxious to protect intellectual property and avoid competitors free-riding on ideas.
This ‘closed’ model of innovation contrasts with the newer ‘open model’ of innovation.18
Open innovation involves the deliberate import and export of knowledge by an organ-
isation in order to accelerate and enhance its innovation. The motivating idea of open
innovation is that exchanging ideas openly is likely to produce better products more quickly
than the internal, closed approach. Speedier and superior products are what are needed to
keep ahead of the competition, not obsessive secrecy.19
    Open innovation is being widely adopted. For example, technology giant IBM has estab-
lished a network of 10 ‘collaboratories’ with other companies and universities, in countries
ranging from Switzerland to Saudi Arabia. Swedish music streaming service Spotify arranges
‘music hack days’ in various locations around the globe where developers are invited for a
day of free food, drink and work on discussing and developing new applications. Crowd-
sourcing is an increasingly popular form of open innovation and means that a company
or organisation broadcasts a specific problem to a crowd of individuals or teams, often
in tournaments with prizes awarded to the best solution.20 Companies such as Procter &
Gamble, Eli Lilly and Dow Chemicals use the network company InnoCentive to set innovation
‘challenges’ (or problems) in open competition over the Internet. Since 2001 they have run

                           Open innovation typically requires careful support of collaborators. In particular,
                        high-technology firms nurture independent companies through successive waves of inno-
                        vation around their basic technological ‘platforms’ (see Section 7.4.2).21 Intel, whose micro-
                        processors are used by a host of computer, tablet and smartphone companies, regularly
                        publishes ‘roadmaps’ outlining several years ahead the new products it expects to release,
                        allowing developers, suppliers and customers to plan their own new product development
                        processes. In this way platform companies foster communities of other companies around
                        their platforms.
                           The communities formed around the platforms are referred to as ecosystems and consist
                        of a group of mutually dependent and collaborative partners that need to interact to
                        create value for all. Rather than building on traditional bilateral collaborations they build on
                        multilateral communities of connected suppliers, software developers, agents, distributors,

Questions
1 How can ARM attract and manage so many ecosystem partners?
2 Can you identify other technology platform companies and their ecosystem partners?




                          franchisees, technology entrepreneurs and makers of complementary products around
                          a platform or company.22 For example, Alibaba, Facebook and Microsoft nurture various
                          ecosystems around their platforms. Most fundamentally the ecosystem partnership includes
                          a platform innovator, a set of complementors, suppliers and customers that together create
                          value rather than doing so independently. However, while they share the interest to grow
                          the whole market around the platform they compete over how the value is distributed
                          among the various ecosystem participants. Apple’s ecosystem of apps around the iPhone,
                          for example, benefit both them and app developers that get the benefit of a large and often
                          lucrative market. Apple has paid out over $100bn to developers since the App Store’s incep-
                          tion, but they also charge a 30 per cent fee based on the app sales. Small entrepreneurial
                          firms wishing to participate in such ecosystems thus have to be skilled in managing relation-
                          ships with powerful technological leaders.23 Ecosystems also compete with each other, in
                          the case of Apple’s iOS for example, the Alphabet Android ecosystems for smartphones is
                          a significant competitor, Uber’s ecosystem competes with Lyft’s and Intel’s with ARM’s. See

Chapter 10 Entrepreneurship and innovation


                      The balance between open and closed innovation depends on three key factors:

                   • Competitive rivalry. In highly rivalrous industries, partners are liable to behave
                     opportunistically and steal innovations. Closed innovation is better where such rivalrous
                     behaviours can be anticipated.
                   • One-shot innovation. Opportunistic behaviour is more likely where innovation involves a
                     major shift in technology, likely to put winners substantially ahead and losers permanently
                     behind. Open innovation works best where innovation is more continuous, so encour-
                     aging more reciprocal behaviour over time.
                   • Tight-linked innovation. Where technologies are complex and tightly interlinked, open
                     innovation risks introducing damagingly inconsistent elements, with knock-on effects
                     throughout the product range. Apple, with its smoothly integrated range of products
                     from computers to phones, has therefore tended to prefer closed innovation in order to
                     protect the quality of the user experience.



10.4 Innovation diffusion
                   This chapter has been concerned with entrepreneurship and its outcome in the form of
                   diverse sources and types of innovation, for example technology push or market pull. This
                   section moves to the diffusion of innovations after they have been introduced.24 Diffusion
                   is the process by which innovations spread among users. Since innovation is typically
                   expensive, its commercial attractiveness can hinge on the pace – extent and speed – at
                   which the market adopts new products and services. This pace of diffusion is something
                   managers can influence from both the supply and demand sides, and which they can also
                   model using the S-curve.


                   10.4.1 The pace of diffusion
                   The pace of diffusion can vary widely according to the nature of the products concerned. It
                   took 28 years for the television to reach 50 per cent of ownership and use in the USA and
                   the mobile phone only half that time. The pace of diffusion is influenced by a combination
                   of supply-side and demand-side factors, over which managers have considerable control. On
                   the supply side, pace is determined by product features such as:

                   • Degree of improvement in performance above current products (from a customer’s
                     perspective) that provides incentive to change. For example, 3G mobile phones did not
                     first provide sufficient performance improvement to prompt rapid switch in many markets.
                     Managers need to make sure innovation benefits sufficiently exceed development costs.
                   • Compatibility with other factors: for example HDTV becomes more attractive as the broad-
                     casting networks change their programmes to that format. Managers and entrepreneurs
                     therefore need to ensure appropriate complementary products and services are in place
                     (see Section 3.2.6).
                   • Complexity, either in the product itself or in the marketing methods being used to
                     commercialise the product: unduly complex pricing structures, as with many financial
                     service products such as pensions, discourage consumer adoption. Simple pricing struc-
                     tures typically accelerate adoptions.
                   • Experimentation – the ability to test products before commitment to a final decision –
                     either directly or through the availability of information about the experience of other
                     customers. Free initial trial periods are often used to encourage diffusion.

                                                                      10.4 Innovation diffusion


• Relationship management, in other words how easy it is to get information, place orders
  and receive support. Managers and entrepreneurs need to put in place an appropriate
  relationship management process to assist new and existing users.

On the demand side, simple affordability is of course key. Beyond this, there are three further
factors that tend to drive the pace of diffusion:

• Market awareness. Many potentially successful products have failed through lack of
  consumer awareness – particularly when the promotional effort of the innovator has
  been confined to ‘push’ promotion to its intermediaries (e.g. distributors).
• Network effects refer to the way that demand growth for some products accelerates as
  more people adopt the product or service. Once a critical mass of users has adopted it, it
  becomes of much greater benefit, or even necessary, for others to adopt it too. With 1.75
  billion users, Facebook is practically the obligatory social network for most readers of this
  book (see Section 3.2.3).
• Customer propensity to adopt: the distribution of potential customers from early-adopter
  groups (keen to adopt first) through to laggards (typically indifferent to innovations). Inno-
  vations are often targeted initially at early-adopter groups – typically the young and the
  wealthy – in order to build the critical mass that will encourage more laggardly groups –
  the poorer and older – to join the bandwagon. Clothing fashion trends typically start with
  the wealthy and then are diffused to the wider population.



10.4.2 The diffusion S-curve
The pace of diffusion is typically not steady. Successful innovations often diffuse according to
a broad S-curve pattern.25 The shape of the S-curve reflects a process of initial slow adop-
tion of innovation, followed by a rapid acceleration in diffusion, leading to a plateau
representing the limit to demand (Figure 10.6). The height of the S-curve shows the extent
of diffusion; the shape of the S-curve shows the speed.

Chapter 10 Entrepreneurship and innovation


                      Diffusion rarely follows exactly this pattern, but nonetheless the S-curve can help
                   managers and entrepreneurs anticipate forthcoming issues. In particular, the S-curve points
                   to four likely decision points:

                   • Timing of the ‘tipping point’. Demand for a successful new product or service may initially
                     be slow but then reaches a tipping point when it explodes onto a rapid upwards path of
                     growth.26 A tipping point is where demand for a product or service suddenly takes off,
                     with explosive growth. Tipping points are particularly explosive where there are strong
                     network effects: in other words, where the value of a product or service is increased the
                     more people in a network use them (see Section 3.2.6).
                   • Timing of the plateau. The S-curve also alerts managers to a likely eventual slowdown
                     in demand growth. Again, it is tempting to extrapolate existing growth rates forwards,
                     especially when they are highly satisfactory. But heavy investment immediately before
                     growth turns down is likely to leave firms with over-capacity and carrying extra costs in a
                     period of industry shake-out.
                   • Extent of diffusion. The S-curve does not necessarily lead to one hundred per cent
                     diffusion among potential users. Most innovations fail to displace previous-gener-
                     ation products and services altogether. For example, in music, traditional LP and CD
                     discs are still preferred over smartphone MP3 files by some connoisseurs and DJs. A
                     critical issue for managers then is to estimate the final ceiling on diffusion, being
                     careful not to assume that tipping point growth will necessarily take over the whole
                     market.
                   • Timing of the ‘tripping point’. The tripping point is the opposite of the tipping point,
                     referring to when demand suddenly collapses.27 For example, the presence of network
                     effects can lead to relatively limited customer defections setting off a market landslide.
                     Such landslides are very hard to reverse. This is what happened to social networking site
                     MySpace, as American and European users defected to Facebook. Facebook, in turn, may
                     have considered this risk themselves when they acquired Instagram as younger users
                     started to move there (see Illustration 3.2). Of course, decline is often more gradual, but
                     the tripping point warns managers that a small dip in sales could presage a more rapid
                     collapse.

                   To summarise, the S-curve is a useful concept to help managers and entrepreneurs avoid
                   simply extrapolating next year’s sales from last year’s sales. However, the tripping point
                   also underlines the fact that innovations do not follow an inevitable process, and their
                   diffusion patterns can be interrupted or reversed at any point. Netflix, for example,
                   has managed to move from a tripping point in DVD rentals to a new S curve of digital
                   streaming.28 Most innovations, of course, do not even reach a tipping point, let alone a
                   tripping point. 29



10.5 Innovators and imitators
                   A key choice for managers is whether to lead or to follow in innovation. The S-curve concept
                   seems to promote leadership in innovation. First-movers get the easy sales of early fast
                   growth and can establish a dominant position. There are plenty of examples of first-movers
                   who have built enduring positions on the basis of innovation leadership: Coca-Cola in drinks
                   and Hoover in vacuum cleaners are powerful century-old examples. On the other hand, many
                   first-movers fail. Even the powerful Microsoft failed with its first tablet launched in 2001.
                   Nine years later, Apple swept the market with its iPad tablet.

10.5.1 First-mover advantages and disadvantages
A first-mover advantage exists where an organisation is better off than its competitors as
a result of being first to market with a new product, process or service. Fundamentally, the
first-mover is a monopolist, theoretically able to charge customers high prices without fear
of immediate undercutting by competitors. In practice, however, innovators often prefer to
sacrifice profit margins for sales growth and, besides, monopoly is usually temporary. There
are six potentially more robust first-mover advantages:30

• Network effects suggest that a customer of a product or service has a positive effect on the
  value of that for other customers and if they are present and captured by an individual
  firm it may be very difficult, if not impossible, for late entrants to catch up and build their
  own network of customers (see Section 3.2.3).
• Experience curve benefits accrue to first-movers, as their rapid accumulation of experience
  with the innovation gives them greater expertise than late entrants still relatively unfa-
  miliar with the new product, process or service (see Section 7.3.1).
• Scale benefits are typically enjoyed by first-movers, as they establish earlier than compet-
  itors the volumes necessary for mass production and bulk purchasing, for example.
• Pre-emption of scarce resources is an opportunity for first-movers, as late-movers will not
  have the same access to key raw materials, skilled labour or components, and will have to
  pay dearly for them.
• Reputation can be enhanced by being first, especially since consumers have little ‘mind-
  space’ to recognise new brands once a dominant brand has been established in the
  market.
• Buyer switching costs can be exploited by first-movers, by locking in their customers with
  privileged or sticky relationships that later challengers can only break with difficulty.
  Switching costs can be increased by establishing and exploiting a technological standard.

Experience curve benefits, economies of scale and the pre-emption of scarce resources all
confer cost advantages on first-movers. It is possible for them to retaliate against chal-
lengers with a price war. Superior reputation and customer lock-in provide a marketing
advantage, allowing first-movers to charge high prices, which can then be reinvested in
order to consolidate their position against late-entry competitors. Network effects can
provide for both cost and marketing advantages provided a sufficiently large network is
built before new entrants.
   But the experience of Microsoft with its tablet computer shows that first-mover advantages
are not necessarily overwhelming. Late-movers have two principal potential advantages:31

• Free-riding. Late-movers can imitate technological and other innovation at less expense
  than originally incurred by the pioneers. Research suggests that the costs of imitation are
  only 65 per cent of the cost of innovation.32
• Learning. Late-movers can observe what worked well and what did not work well for
  innovators. They may not make so many mistakes and be able to get it right first time.

Given the potential advantages of late-movers, managers and entrepreneurs face a hard
choice between striving to be first or coming in later. London Business School’s Costas
Markides and Paul Geroski argue that the most appropriate response to innovation, espe-
cially radical innovation, is often not to be a first-mover, but to be a ‘fast second’. 33 A
fast second strategy involves being one of the first to imitate the original innovator and
thus building an ‘early mover advantage’. Thus fast second companies may not literally
be the second company into the market, but they dominate the second generation of

                   competitors. For example, the French Bookeen company pioneered the e-book market in
                   the early 2000s, but was soon followed by Amazon’s Kindle. Likewise, the first jet airliner
                   was the British de Havilland Comet with Boeing being a successful follower.34
                     Three factors need to be considered in choosing between innovating and imitating:

                   • Capacity for profit capture: the importance of innovators to capture for themselves the
                     profits of their innovations. David Teece of the University of California Berkeley empha-
                     sises that this may be challenging if the innovation is easy to replicate and if intellectual
                     property rights are weak, for example where patents are hard to define or defend.35
                   • Complementary assets: the possession of assets or resources necessary to scale up the
                     production and marketing of the innovation.36 For organisations wishing to remain
                     independent and to exploit their innovations themselves, there is little point in investing
                     heavily to be first-mover in the absence of the necessary complementary assets.
                   • Fast-moving arenas: where markets or technologies are moving very fast and espe-
                     cially where both are highly dynamic, first-movers are unlikely to establish a durable
                     advantage.


                   10.5.2 The incumbent’s response
                   Definitions of entrepreneurship often emphasise pursuing opportunities and developing
                   innovations without immediately being constrained by the resources under present control.
                   This refers to the fact that incumbent organisations and companies mostly are constrained
                   by their existing resources, capabilities, activities and vested interests. This suggests that for
                   established companies in a market innovation can be challenging and innovations from
                   others can be a threat. Kodak’s dominance of the photographic film market was made nearly
                   worthless by the sudden rise of digital photography (Illustration 6.4).
                      As Harvard Business School’s Clay Christensen has shown, the problem for incumbents can
                   be twofold.37 First, managers can become too attached to existing assets and skills: under-
                   standably, as these are what their careers have been built on. Second, relationships between
                   incumbent organisations and their customers can become too close. Existing customers
                   typically prefer incremental improvements to current technologies, and are unable to
                   imagine completely new technologies. Incumbents are reluctant to ‘cannibalise’ their existing
                   business by introducing something radically different. After all, as in Figure 10.7, incumbents
                   usually have some scope for improving their existing technology, along the steady upwards
                   trajectory described as Technology 1. Innovations on this trajectory are termed ‘sustaining
                   innovations’, because they at least allow the existing technology to meet existing customer
                   expectations.
                      The challenge for incumbents, however, is disruptive innovation. A disruptive innovation
                   creates substantial growth by offering a new performance trajectory that, even if initially
                   inferior to the performance of existing technologies, has the potential to become mark-
                   edly superior. This superior performance can produce spectacular growth, either by creating
                   new sets of customers or by undercutting the cost base of rival existing business models. Such
                   disruptive innovation involves the shift from Technology 1 in Figure 10.7 to Technology 2.
                   Disruptive innovations are hard for incumbents to respond to because poor performance
                   in the early days is likely to upset existing customer relationships and because they typically
                   involve changing their whole business model (see Chapter 7). Thus, in the music industry,
                   the major record companies with traditional CDs first responded to online music simply by
                   prosecuting new distribution forms such as Napster, but today streaming services such as
                   Spotify and Apple Music dominate.

   Sometimes, however, incumbents do respond. The mobile phone disrupted the fixed tele-
phony business, but Ericsson managed to continue its leadership in telephony systems. To
encourage innovation and be responsive to potentially disruptive innovations there are three
different approaches:

• Develop a portfolio of real options. Companies that are most challenged by disruptive inno-
  vations tend to be those built upon a single business model and with one main product
  or service. Columbia’s Rita McGrath and Wharton’s Ian MacMillan recommend that
  companies build portfolios of real options in order to maintain organisational dynamism.38
  Real options are limited investments that keep opportunities open for the future (for a
  more technical discussion, see Section 12.4.2). Establishing an R&D team in a speculative
  new technology or acquiring a small start-up in a nascent market would both be exam-
  ples of real options, each giving the potential to scale up fast should the opportunity turn
  out to be substantial. McGrath and MacMillan’s portfolio identifies three different kinds
  of options (Figure 10.8). Options where the market is broadly known, but the technolo-
  gies are still uncertain, are positioning options: a company might want several of these, to
  ensure some position in an important market, by one technology or another. On the other
  hand, a company might have a strong technology, but be very uncertain about appropriate
  markets, in which case it would want to bet on several scouting options to explore which
  markets are actually best. Finally, a company would want some stepping stone options, very
  unlikely in themselves to work, but possibly leading to something more promising in the
  future. Even if they do not turn a profit, stepping stones should provide valuable learning
  opportunities. An important principle for options is: ‘Fail fast, fail cheap, try again.’39
• Corporate venturing. New ventures, especially when undertaken from a real options
  perspective, may need protection from the usual systems and disciplines of a core
  business. It would make no sense to hold the managers of a real option strictly
  accountable for sales growth and profit margin: their primary objective is preparation
  and learning. For this reason, large incumbent organisations often establish relatively

                      autonomous ‘new venture units’, sometimes called new venture divisions, which can
                      nurture new ideas or invest externally and acquire novel and untried businesses with
                      a longer-term view.40 BMW, for example, set up a completely separate business unit
                      to develop its first mass-produced electric car, BMW i. The company was concerned
                      that its focus on the internal combustion engine would risk the success of the devel-
                      opment of the BMW i.
                   • Intrapreneurship. This approach rather emphasises the individual and the ability to
                     perform entrepreneurial activities within a large organisation.41 Companies can thus
                     encourage employees throughout the organisation to be creative and develop entrepre-
                     neurial ideas as part of their regular job. Alphabet has intrapreneurship programmes that
                     aim at creating a start-up culture within the larger corporation. Likewise, IBM has various
                     initiatives to encourage intrapreneurship and innovation, such as ‘Intrapreneurship@
                     IBM’ and the ‘IBM Jam sessions’. Intrapreneurship, however, can also be autonomous
                     from, and in conflict with, corporate management and is thus not always to be encour-
                     aged. For example, Ericsson’s global leadership in mobile telephone systems initially
                     started out with a group of intrapreneurs in confrontation with corporate strategy and
                     management.

                   Whether by developing real options, internal venture units or equivalent means, it is clear
                   that established incumbents need to be able to support a spirit of intrapreneurship.42

                       Summary
                       • Opportunity recognition involves three important and interdependent elements: the
                         environment, the entrepreneur or entrepreneurial team and resources and capabilities.
                       • The entrepreneurship process typically involves the following: a business plan, a feasibility
                         analysis, industry conditions and competitor analysis, business model and strategy choice
                         and financing and funding.
                       • Social entrepreneurship offers a flexible way of addressing social problems, but raises issues
                         about appropriate missions, organisational forms and business models.
                       • Strategists face three fundamental innovation dilemmas: relative emphasis to put on tech-
                         nology push or market pull; whether to focus on product or process innovation; and finally,
                         how much to rely on ‘open innovation’ and related ecosystems or more ‘closed innovation’.
                       • Innovations often diffuse according to an S-curve model in which slow start-up is followed
                         by accelerating growth (the ‘tipping point’) and finally a flattening of demand (and a
                         potential ‘tripping point’).
                       • Innovators can capture first-mover advantages, but ‘fast second’ strategies are often more
                         attractive.
                       • Established incumbents’ businesses should beware disruptive innovations. Incumbents can
                         stave off inertia by developing portfolios of real options, by organising autonomous new
                         venture units or by encouraging ‘intrapreneurship’.

                       Work assignments
                        ✱ Denotes more advanced work assignments.
                        * Refers to a case study in the Text and Cases edition.

                       10.1 Use Figure 10.2 and try to identify the three elements (entrepreneur/team, trends/
                            gaps and resources/capabilities) behind the opportunity recognition in Apple*,
                            Widespace* and Ryanair*.
                       10.2 With reference to the entrepreneurial life cycle, identify the position of Rovio (end
                            of chapter case), Mormor Magda’s Ice Cream* or Ningbo Smarter Logistics*. What
                            managerial issues might this case company anticipate in the coming years?
                       10.3 Use the Internet to identify a social entrepreneurial venture that interests you (via
                            www.skollfoundation.org, for example), and, with regard to Section 10.2.4, identify
                            its social mission, its organisational form and its business model.
                       10.4✱ For a new product or service that you have recently experienced and enjoyed, inves-
                             tigate the strategy of the company responsible. With reference to the dilemmas of
                             Section 10.3, explain whether the innovation was more technology push or market
                             pull, product or process driven, or based on open versus closed innovation.
                       10.5 Go to a web traffic site (such as alexa.com) and compare over time trends in terms of
                            ‘page views’ or ‘reach’ for older sites (such as Amazon.com) and newer sites (such as
                            spotify.com, or any that has more recently emerged). With reference to Section 10.4,
                            how do you explain these trends and how would you project them forward?
                       10.6✱ With regard to a new product or service that you have recently experienced and
                             enjoyed (as in Section 10.4), investigate the strategic responses of ‘incumbents’ to this
                             innovation. To what extent is the innovation disruptive for them (see Section 10.5.2)?

                       Integrative assignment
                       10.7 Consider a for-profit or social entrepreneurial idea that you or your friends or
                            colleagues might have. Drawing on Section 16.4.4, outline the elements of a stra-
                            tegic plan for this possible venture. What more information do you need to get?

11.1 Introduction
          Mergers, acquisitions and alliances are all common methods for achieving growth strat-
          egies and often in the news. For example, in 2018 AT&T, a giant US media company,
          announced the acquisition of Time Warner for $85bn. This unites America’s second largest
          mobile phone provider, third largest broadband provider and second largest pay-TV
          provider with Time Warner’s content including HBO, CNN, Warner Bros and DC comics. In
          the same year Atos, a digital transformation specialist, created an alliance with Google to
          help businesses tap into data lakes, data management, analytics and cognitive technol-
          ogies. The deal will see Atos and Google Cloud create and sell a range of hybrid cloud,
          machine learning and collaboration solutions to businesses across the world. As these
          cases show, acquisitions and alliances are big business with major implications for the
          strategic development of companies.
             This chapter therefore addresses mergers, acquisitions and alliances as key methods
          for pursuing strategic options. It will consider them alongside the principal alternative of
          ‘organic’ development, in other words the pursuit of a strategy relying on a company’s own
          resources. Figure 11.1 shows how the main strategic options considered in the previous three
          chapters – diversification, internationalisation and innovation – can all be achieved through
          mergers and acquisitions, alliances or organic development. Of course, these three methods
          can also be used for many other strategies as well, for example consolidating markets or
          building scale advantages.
             The chapter starts with organic development as organisations are likely to rely on internal
          resources for growth as the least risky route forwards. The chapter then introduces mergers
          and acquisitions (M&A) and then strategic alliances as two principle external growth options.
          The final section compares these external options against the internal option of organic
          development. M&A and alliances fail frequently and so a fundamental question is when to
          acquire, when to ally or when to ‘do it yourself’? The final section also considers key success
          factors in M&A and strategic alliances. At the end of this chapter a new insight into under-
          standing M&A performance is presented.

11.2 Organic development
                    The default method for pursuing a strategy is to ‘do it yourself’, relying on internal capabil-
                    ities. Thus organic development is where a strategy is pursued by building on, and devel-
                    oping, an organisation’s own capabilities. For example, Amazon’s creation of Echo, an
                    intelligent, voice-controlled household appliance that could play music and order groceries,
                    took years to develop in its in-house labs. Echo was project D that came out of Lab126 in
                    San Francisco, where several hundred people worked on multiple innovations, such as Kindle
                    and Fire TV. In 2018 sales of Echo reached 50 millions units and Amazon believes the next
                    big platform is voice-activated cloud computing, as Echo continues to increase its ability to
                    connect to internet-connected appliances and accounts. Amazon pursued this do-it-yourself
                    (DIY) diversification method as there was no other company producing a virtual assistant at
                    the time which didn’t rely on a screen, there was a lot of scepticism around market demand
                    for the product and there were many significant technical hurdles to overcome. There are
                    five principal advantages to relying on organic development:

                    • Knowledge and learning. Using the organisation’s existing capabilities to pursue a new
                      strategy can enhance organisational knowledge and learning. Direct involvement in
                      a new market or technology is likely to promote the acquisition and internalisation of
                      deeper knowledge than a hands-off strategic alliance, for example.
                    • Spreading investment over time. Acquisitions typically require an immediate upfront
                      payment for the target company. Organic development allows the spreading of invest-
                      ment over the whole time span of the strategy’s development. This reduction of upfront
                      commitment may make it easier to reverse or adjust a strategy if conditions change.
                    • No availability constraints. Organic development has the advantage of not being
                      dependent on the availability of suitable acquisition targets or potential alliance part-
                      ners. There are few acquisition opportunities for foreign companies wanting to enter
                      the Japanese market, for example. Organic developers also do not have to wait until the
                      perfectly matched acquisition target comes onto the market.
                    • Strategic independence. The independence provided by organic development means that
                      an organisation does not need to make the same compromises as might be necessary if
                      it made an alliance with a partner organisation. For example, partnership with a foreign
                      collaborator is likely to involve constraints on marketing activity in external markets and
                      may limit future strategic choices.
                    • Culture management. Organic development allows new activities to be created in the
                      existing cultural environment, which reduces the risk of culture clash that could occur
                      with external growth options.

                       The reliance of organic development on internal capabilities can be slow, expensive
                    and risky, as shown by Amazon’s lengthy gestation period for Echo and earlier failures
                    such as fire phone. It is not easy to use existing capabilities as the platform for major
                    leaps in terms of innovation, diversification or internationalisation, for example. However
                    organic development can be very successful and, as in the example of Amazon’s Echo, be
                    sufficiently radical to merit the term ‘corporate entrepreneurship’. Corporate entrepreneurship
                    refers to radical change in the organisation’s business, driven principally by the
                    organisation’s own capabilities.1 Bringing together the words ‘entrepreneurship’ and
                    ‘corporate’ underlines the potential for significant change or novelty not only by external
                    entrepreneurship (see also corporate venturing in Section 10.5.2), but also by reliance
                    on internal capabilities from within the corporate organisation. Thus for online retailer
                    Amazon, Alexa was a radical entrepreneurial step, taking it into a new voice-activated

          industry in the hope that creating a new way of doing things would give it an edge over
          its competitors Apple and Google, grow new consumer demand and create a new billion
          dollar business.
              The concept of corporate entrepreneurship is valuable because it encourages a creative
          attitude inside the firm. Often, however, organisations have to go beyond their own internal
          capabilities and look externally for methods to pursue their strategies. This chapter will
          examine two of these methods, M&A and strategic alliances.



11.3 Mergers and acquisitions
          Mergers and acquisitions (M&A) frequently grab the headlines, as they involve large sums of
          money and can affect a wide range of stakeholders. They can also provide a speedy means of
          achieving major strategic objectives. However, they can also lead to spectacular failures, either
          because the acquirer is forced to withdraw at great financial and strategic expense, as in the
          case of US agricultural giant Monsanto’s failed bid of $47bn for Swiss company Syngenta that
          then led to the acquirer being acquired itself by Bayer for $66bn, or due to post-acquisition
          integration difficulties. For instance, differences in culture are being cited for difficulties in
          Amazon’s integration of Whole Foods, acquired in 2017, with people crying at work, scorecards
          being used to punish and terminate contracts and employees now taking steps to unionise.2


          11.3.1 Defining M&A
          M&A are about the combination of organisations. In an acquisition (or takeover) an acquirer
          takes control of another company through share purchase. Thus acquisition is achieved
          by purchasing a majority of shares in a target company. Most acquisitions are friendly,
          where the target’s management recommends accepting the deal to its shareholders.
          Acquirers prefer this, as target management is more likely to work with them to integrate
          both companies. Sometimes acquisitions are hostile, where target management refuses the
          acquirer’s offer. In this circumstance the acquirer appeals directly to the target’s shareholders
          for ownership of their shares. Hostile deals can be very acrimonious with target company
          management obstructing efforts to obtain key information and creating problems for
          post-deal integration. In general acquirers are larger than target companies although there
          may be ‘reverse’ takeovers, where acquirers are smaller than their targets.
             A merger differs from an acquisition, as it is the combination of two previously separate
          organisations in order to form a new company. For example, with significant changes
          introduced by government into the UK pensions market, hard-hit annuity providers Just
          Retirement and Partnership Assurance lost half their market share and decided to announce
          their intention to merge in August 2015 to form a £1.6bn company. Merger partners are
          often of similar size, with expectations of broadly equal status, unlike an acquisition where
          the acquirer generally dominates. In practice, the terms ‘merger’ and ‘acquisition’ are often
          used interchangeably, hence the common shorthand M&A.
             M&A can also happen in the public and non-profit sectors: for example, in the UK in
          2018, in response to sustained pressures to reduce costs through national austerity measures,
          two councils have recently had their plans to merge approved by government. Many other
          councils are also in debate about the merits of merging to achieve cost savings and improve
          efficiency. Publicly owned institutions frequently build up highly distinctive cultures or
          systems of their own, as if they were in fact independent organisations. Where there are
          major cultural or systems differences between organisations, the scale and depth of the
          managerial issues approximate to those that would be involved in a change of ownership.

                                                                                                        337
Chapter 11 Mergers, acquisitions and alliances


                    ‘Merger’ is therefore often used in such cases as that better reflects the scale of the task
                    involved than simply ‘reorganisation’.


                    11.3.2 M&A contexts
                    M&A do not happen in a vacuum but are embedded in historical, geographic and organ-
                    isational contexts.

                    • Historical context. Since records began in the late nineteenth century, M&A have shown
                      a cyclical quality, involving high peaks and deep troughs. Thus 2015 recorded the highest
                      annual total of M& since records began, with $5.03trn of deals, up 37 per cent from the
                      previous year, and more than double the volume of the global recession of $2.26trn in 2009.3
                      M&A cycles are broadly linked to changes in the global economy but are also influenced by
                      new regulations, the availability of finance, stock market performance, technological disturb-
                      ances and the supply of available target firms. They may also be driven by over-optimism on
                      the part of managers, shareholders and bankers during upturns, and by exaggerated loss
                      of confidence during downturns. This cyclical pattern suggests that there are better times
                      than others for making an acquisition. At the top of a cycle, target companies are likely to
                      be very highly priced, which may reduce the chances of success for an acquirer. These cycles
                      should warn managers that M&A may have a strong fashion element. Especially in an upturn,
                      managers should ask very carefully whether acquisitions are really justified.
                    • Geographical context. Global activity in mergers has traditionally been dominated by North
                      America and Western Europe, whereas it has been much less common in other economies,
                      for example Japan. Many national governance systems put barriers in the way of acquisitions,
                      especially hostile acquisitions (see Section 5.3.2). However, companies from fast-developing
                      economies such as China and India have become very active in large-scale acquisitions in order
                      to access Western markets or technology, or to secure material resources needed for growth.
                      For example, ChemChina’s acquisition of Swiss company Syngenta in 2017, for $43bn gives
                      the acquirer access to the world’s largest crop chemical producer and world-leading biotech-
                      nology research. While approximately one third of all M&A are cross border, the remainder
                      are within national boundaries. While this means that the difficulties that can occur due to
                      different national institutions and cultures are overcome, in many countries there are very
                      significant regional differences that can come into play and influence M&A outcome.4
                    • Organisational context. Although M&A is generally talked about as one company taking
                      over another, often small acquisitions are subsumed within a larger acquirer which is likely
                      to be engaged in a wide range of other activities that might also include other acquisitions
                      and alliances. Trying to integrate a newly acquired company into a shifting mix of other,
                      often larger strategic initiatives can create significant internal stresses.5


                    11.3.3 M&A strategy
                    M&A strategies are often a complex mix of strategic, financial and managerial6 motives (see
                    Illustration 11.1) that can sometimes be difficult to disentangle.


                    Strategic motives for M&A
                    Strategic motives for M&A involve improving the competitive advantage of the organisation.
                    These motives are often related to the reasons for diversification in general (see Section 8.3).
                    Strategic motives can be categorised in three main ways:7

                    • Extension. M&A can be used to extend the reach of a firm in terms of geography, products
                      or markets. For instance, transactions such as Valeant Pharmaceuticals’ $55bn purchase of

                    • Consolidation. M&A can be used to consolidate the competitors in an industry. Bringing
                      together two competitors can have at least three beneficial effects. In the first place, it increases
                      market power by reducing competition: this might enable the newly consolidated company to
                      raise prices for customers. Second, the combination of two competitors can increase efficiency
                      through reducing surplus capacity or sharing resources, for instance head-office facilities or
                      distribution channels. Finally, the greater scale of the combined operations may increase
                      production efficiency, increase bargaining power with suppliers, forcing them to reduce their
                      prices and greater market power. These reasons lie behind the 2018 merger between media
                      giant Comcast’s $38.8bn takeover of UK’s media telecommunications company Sky TV.
                    • Resources and capabilities. The third broad strategic motive for M&A is to increase a
                      company’s resources and capabilities. High-tech companies such as Cisco and Micro-
                      soft regard acquisitions of entrepreneurial technology companies as a part of their R&D
                      effort. Instead of researching a new technology from scratch, they allow entrepreneurial
                      start-ups to prove the idea, and then take over these companies in order to incorporate
                      the technological capability within their own portfolio (see Section 10.5.2). For example,
                      Alphabet, formerly Google acquired Israeli start-up Velostrata in 2018, which helps
                      companies migrate from on-site data premises to the cloud. This could give Google a
                      valuable tool in its battle for cloud market share.

                    In addition, capabilities-driven acquisitions are often useful where industries are converging
                    (see Section 3.3.1).

                    Financial motives for M&A
                    Financial motives concern the optimal use of financial resources, rather than directly
                    improving the actual business. There are three main financial motives:

                    • Financial efficiency. An acquirer with a strong balance sheet (i.e. has plenty of cash) may
                      help improve a highly indebted target company (i.e. a weak balance sheet). The target
                      can save on interest payments by using the acquirer’s assets to pay off its debt, and it can
                      also get investment funds that it could not have accessed otherwise. The acquirer may
                      also be able to drive a good bargain in acquiring the weaker company. Also, an acquirer
                      with a booming share price can purchase targets very efficiently by offering to pay target
                      shareholders with its own shares (equity), rather than paying with cash upfront.
                    • Tax efficiency. Sometimes there may be tax advantages from bringing together different
                      companies. For example, profits or tax losses may be transferrable within the organisa-
                      tion in order to benefit from different tax regimes between industries or countries. In
                      November 2015 US giant Pfizer announced the largest ‘tax inversion’ deal ever at $160bn
                      (€120; £97bn), with the takeover of Irish-based Allergan, to form the world’s largest drug
                      company. Pfizer’s headquarters would move to Ireland where it would pay 17 per cent tax
                      rather than the 25 per cent it was paying in the USA. In this instance the USA brought out
                      new rules that thwarted this particular deal, but the practice still continues despite legal
                      restrictions and the possibilities that governments may also adjust their tax rates later on.
                    • Asset stripping or unbundling. Some companies are effective at spotting other companies
                      whose underlying assets are worth more than the price of the company as a whole. This
                      makes it possible to buy such companies and then rapidly sell off (‘unbundle’) different
                      business units to various buyers for a total price substantially in excess of what was origin-
                      ally paid for the whole. Although this is often dismissed as merely opportunistic profit-
                      eering (‘asset stripping’), if the business units find better corporate parents through this
                      unbundling process, there can be a real gain in economic effectiveness.

Managerial motives for M&A
As for diversification (see Section 8.3), M&A may sometimes serve managers’ more than
shareholders’ interests. ‘Managerial’ motives are therefore self-serving rather than
efficiency-driven. M&A may serve managerial self-interest for two reasons:

• Personal ambition. These can take three forms regardless of the real value being created.
  First, senior managers’ personal financial incentives may be tied to short-term growth
  targets or share-price targets that are more easily achieved by large and spectacular acqui-
  sitions than the more gradualist and lower-profile alternative of organic growth. Second,
  large acquisitions attract media attention, with opportunities to boost personal reputa-
  tions through flattering media interviews and appearances. Here there is the so-called
  ‘managerial hubris’ (vanity) effect: managers who have been successful in earlier acqui-
  sitions become over-confident and embark on more and more acquisitions, each riskier
  and more expensive than the one before.8 Finally, acquisitions provide opportunities to
  give friends and colleagues greater responsibility, helping to cement personal loyalty by
  developing individuals’ careers.
• Bandwagon effects. As noted earlier, acquisitions are highly cyclical. In an upswing, there are
  three kinds of pressure on senior managers to join the acquisition bandwagon. First, when
  many other firms are making acquisitions, financial analysts and the business media may
  criticise more cautious managers for undue conservatism. Second, shareholders may fear
  that their company is being left behind, as they see opportunities for their business being
  snatched by rivals. Lastly, managers may worry that if their company is not acquiring, it will
  become the target of a hostile bid itself. For managers wanting a quiet life during a ‘merger
  boom’, the easiest strategy may be simply to join in. But the danger is making an acquisition
  the company does not really need and it can be one reason for paying too much.

   In sum, there are bad as well as good reasons for M&A. The general consensus remains
that the average performance of deals is unimpressive, with some evidence suggesting that
over half fail.9 However, alternative growth methods also exhibit similar problematic levels
of performance. Nevertheless it is worth asking sceptical questions of any M&A strategy.
The converse can be true of course: there can be bad reasons for resisting a hostile takeover.
Senior managers may resist being acquired because they fear losing their jobs, even if the
price offered represents a good deal for their shareholders.

11.3.4 M&A processes
Acquisitions take time. First there is the search to identify an acquisition target with the
best possible fit. This process may take years but sometimes can be completed very rapidly
indeed. Then there is the process of negotiating the deal: to agree on terms and conditions
and the right price. Finally, managers will need to decide on the extent to which the new
and old businesses will need to be integrated – and this will have significant implications for
the amount of time required to create value. In other words, acquisition should be seen as a
process over time. Each step in this process imposes different tasks on managers. This section
will consider three key steps: target choice, negotiation and integration.

Target choice in M&A
There are two main criteria to apply: strategic fit and organisational fit.10

• Strategic fit. This refers to the extent to which the target firm strengthens or comple-
  ments the acquiring firm’s strategy. Strategic fit relates to the original strategic motives
  for the acquisition: extension, consolidation and capabilities. Managers need to assess
  strategic fit very carefully. The danger is that potential synergies (see Section 8.3) in M&A

                                                                                             341

                                                    change of ownership

                         are often exaggerated in order to justify high acquisition prices. Also, negative synergies
                         (‘contagion’) between the companies involved are easily neglected11 when amalgamating
                         aspects of both business models results in value destruction.
                      • Organisational fit. This refers to the match between the management practices, cultural prac-
                        tices and staff characteristics between the target and the acquiring firms. Large mismatches
                        between the two are likely to cause significant integration problems. International acqui-
                        sitions can be particularly liable to organisational misfits, because of cultural and language
                        differences between countries, although the extent to which there is actual cultural clash
                        will be determined by the extent of integration intended. The bid for Starwood by Anbang
                        raises many questions about organisational fit (see Illustration 11.1). A comparison of the
                        two companies’ cultural webs (Section 6.4.6) might be helpful to highlight potential misfit.

                      Together, strategic and organisational fit determine the potential for the acquirer to add
                      value, the parenting issue raised in Section 8.6. Where there is bad organisational fit,
                      attempts by the acquirer to integrate the target are likely to destroy value regardless of
                      how well the target fits strategically. For instance, the merger between French and American
                      telecoms equipment manufacturers Alcatel and Lucent resulted in significant culture clashes
                      for several years post-deal, with losses running into billions of dollars and the departure of
                      the two top executives.
                          Strategic and organisational fit can be used to create a screen according to which potential
                      acquisition targets can be ruled in or ruled out. Note that, because the set of firms that meet
                      the criteria and that are actually available for purchase is likely to be small, it is very tempting for
                      managers to relax the criteria too far in order to build a large enough pool of possible acquisi-
                      tions. Strict strategic and organisational fit criteria are particularly liable to be forgotten after the
                      failure of an initial acquisition bid. Once having committed publicly to an acquisition strategy,
                      senior managers are susceptible to making ill-considered bids for other targets ‘on the rebound’.
                          Strategic and organisational fit are important elements of ‘due diligence’ – a structured
                      investigation of target companies that focuses on key aspects of the target business, such as
                      the reliability of financial and legal information. Due diligence generally takes place before
                      a deal is closed and if it is performed badly, it can lead to serious post-acquisition difficulties.
                      For example, Hewlett-Packard wrote down its $11bn acquisition of Autonomy by $5bn on
                      the basis of poor information and a lawsuit is still in progress. Due diligence also extends
                      through the negotiation phase.

                      Negotiation in M&A
                      The negotiation process in M&A is critical to the outcome of friendly deals. If top manage-
                      ments cannot agree because the price or terms and conditions are unacceptable, or they
                      cannot agree on who will run the combined organisation post deal, the transaction will
                      not take place. In terms of price, offer the target too little, and the bid will be unsuccessful:
                      senior managers will lose credibility and the company will have wasted a lot of management

time. Pay too much, though, and the acquisition is unlikely ever to make a profit net of the
original acquisition price.
    Ways in which the price is established by the acquirer are through the use of various valu-
ation methods, including financial analysis techniques such as payback period, discounted
cash flow, asset valuation and shareholder value analysis (see Chapter 12).12 For acquisition
of publicly quoted companies, the market value of the target company’s shares can act as a
guide. Typically acquirers do not simply pay the current market value of the target, but have
to pay a so-called premium for control. This is the additional amount an acquirer has to pay
to win control compared to the ordinary valuation of the target’s shares as an independent
company. Depending on the state of the financial markets, this premium is often around 30
per cent greater than the current market value of target shares. Where the target resists the
initial bid, or other potential acquirers join in with their own bids, this premium will rise and
it is very easy for bid prices to escalate well beyond the true economic value of the target.
    It is therefore very important for the acquirer to be disciplined regarding the price that it
will pay. Acquisitions are liable to the winner’s curse – in order to win acceptance of the bid,
the acquirer may pay so much that the original cost can never be earned back.13 The negative
effects of paying too much can be worsened if the acquirer tries to justify the price by cutting
back essential investments in order to improve immediate profits. In what is called the vicious
circle of overvaluation, over-paying firms can easily undermine the original rationale of the
acquisition by cutting costs on exactly the assets (e.g. brand-marketing, product R&D or key
staff) that made up the strategic value of the target company in the first place.

Integration in M&A
The ability to extract value from an acquisition will depend critically on how it is integrated
with the acquirer. Integration is frequently challenging because of problems of organisational
fit. For example, there might be strong cultural differences (see Section 6.4) or incompatible
financial or information technology systems (see Section 14.3). Poor integration can cause
acquisitions to fail (see Illustration 11.2 for the way Alphabet has managed its talent acquisi-
tion). Getting the right approach to integration of merged or acquired companies is crucial.
   To identify the most suitable approach to integration depends on two key criteria14:

• The extent of strategic interdependence. This is the need for the transfer or sharing of
  capabilities (for example, technology) or resources (for example, manufacturing facil-
  ities). The presumption is that significant transfer or sharing through tight integration will
  enable the ‘creation’ of value from the acquisition. Of course, some acquisitions ‘capture’
  value purely through the ownership of assets and so there is less need for integration.
  These unrelated or conglomerate diversifications (see Section 8.2) may only be integrated
  in terms of their financial systems.
• The need for organisational autonomy. Where an acquired firm has a very distinct culture, or
  is geographically distant, or is dominated by prima donna professionals or star performers,
  integration may be problematic. For this reason, some acquisitions need high levels of organ-
  isational autonomy. But in some circumstances it is the distinctiveness of the acquired organ-
  isation that is valuable to the acquirer.15 In this case it is best to learn gradually from the
  distinct culture, rather than risk spoiling it by hurried or overly tight integration.

  As in Figure 11.3, therefore, these two criteria result in five integration approaches16
which have important implications for the length of integration period and choice of top
management for the acquired company:

• Absorption is preferred where a high level of strategic interdependence is necessary and there is
  little need for organisational autonomy. Absorption requires rapid adjustment of the acquired
  company’s old strategies and structures to the needs of the new owner, and corresponding

   changes to the acquired company’s culture and systems. In this type of acquisition it is usual
   to appoint a new top manager in order to manage the organisation differently.17
• Preservation is appropriate where the acquired company is well run but not very compat-
  ible with the acquirer. The high need for autonomy and low need for integration may be
  found in conglomerate deals. The Preservation style depends on allowing old strategies,
  cultures and systems to continue in the acquired company much as before. Changes from
  the acquirer are generally confined to the essential minimum such as adjusting financial
  reporting procedures for control and carried out in a slow piecemeal fashion. In this situ-
  ation it is advisable to retain the incumbent top manager.
• Symbiosis is indicated where there is a strong need for strategic interdependence, but
  also a requirement for high autonomy – perhaps in a professional services organisation
  dependent on the creativity of its staff. Symbiosis implies that both acquired firm and
  acquiring firm learn the best qualities from the other. This learning process takes signif-
  icant time and it is often the case that it is best to retain the incumbent top manager in
  the early stages to stabilise the acquisition before bringing in a new top manager to make
  far-reaching changes. This is the most complex of the integration approaches.
• Intensive care takes place where there is little to be gained by integration. These acqui-
  sitions may occur when the acquired company is in poor financial health and very rapid
  remedial action is required.18 The acquirer will not integrate the company into its own
  business to avoid contamination but will impose stringent short-term targets and strat-
  egies in order to solve its problems. In more aggressive turnaround cases the incumbent
  top manager will typically be replaced but otherwise the incumbent is retained for a
  smoother transition. These businesses may often be for sale.

                    • Reorientation acquisitions occur when the acquired company is in good health and well
                      run but there is a need to integrate central administrative areas and align marketing and
                      sales functions. Distinctive resources of the acquired company though are left alone and
                      there are few changes to internal operations. In order to drive through changes quickly a
                      new top manager is generally brought in to run the acquired company.

                       Especially for absorption, symbiosis and re-orientation strategies that require significant
                    organisational interactions, acquisition success will depend upon how well the integration
                    process is managed. Here methods of managing strategic change explained in Chapter 15
                    will be relevant. However, because acquisitions often involve the loss of jobs, sudden career
                    changes, management relocations and the cancellation of projects, it is argued that organ-
                    isational justice is particularly important for successful integration.19
                       Organisational justice refers to the perceived fairness of managerial actions, in terms of
                    distribution, procedure and information. Thus:

                    • Distributive justice refers to the distribution of rewards and posts: for example, it will be
                      seen as unfair in a merger between equals if the large majority of senior management
                      posts go to one of the partners, and not the other.
                    • Procedural justice refers to the procedures by which decisions are made: for example,
                      if integration decisions are made through appropriate committees or task forces with
                      representation from both sides, then the perception of fair procedures is likely to be high.
                    • Informational justice is about how information is used and communicated in the inte-
                      gration: if decisions are explained well to all those involved, they are more likely to be
                      accepted positively.



                    11.3.5 M&A strategy over time
                    M&A strategies evolve over time as deals are rarely one-off events for an organisation.
                    Companies that make multiple acquisitions are termed serial acquirers. When acquisitions
                    occur closely together, these can be very demanding of managerial time and skills. However,
                    repeating the acquisition process does provide an opportunity for acquiring companies to
                    learn how to do M&A better.20 Cisco Systems is well known as a successful serial acquirer.
                    By 2018 it had made 213 acquisitions, worth around $70bn, since its first deal in 1993,
                    which account for at least 50 per cent of revenue. The amount of work in selecting and
                    evaluating targets is significant. In order to make just 50 software acquisitions, IBM had to
                    assess around 500 different potential acquisition targets, choosing not to proceed in the
                    vast majority of cases.21

                    • When a business no longer fits the corporate strategy it may be sold. This is termed divesti-
                      ture (or divestment).22 This is a central part of ‘asset stripping’ strategy (see Section 11.3.3),
                      but ought to be on the agenda of every diversified corporation. The key determinant of
                      divestiture is whether the corporate parent has ‘parenting advantage’: in other words, the
                      corporate parent can add more value to the business unit than other potential owners of
                      the business (see Section 8.6). Where there is no parenting advantage the business should
                      be divested for the best obtainable price. Corporate parents are often reluctant to divest
                      businesses, seeing it as an admission of failure. However, a dynamic perspective on M&A
                      would encourage managers to view divestures positively. Funds raised by the sale of an
                      ill-fitting business can be used either to invest in retained businesses or to buy other busi-
                      nesses that fit the corporate strategy better. Obtaining a good price for the divested unit
                      can recoup any losses it may have originally made. Sometimes, however, a less positive
                      reason for divesture is pressure from competition authorities, which may force the sale of

             businesses to reduce companies’ market power. For example, during 2018 the UK super-
             market chain Sainsbury’s was bidding to acquire a competitor, Asda for £7.3bn, from US
             owners Walmart. Potentially they would have become market leader and dominated the
             UK marketplace. The Competition and Markets Authority decided that Sainsbury’s would
             become overly dominant in the UK market place and so quashed the deal, as it would not
             have been viable for Sainsbury’s to have disposed of a sufficient number of supermarkets
             to prevent dominance in the eyes of the regulator.
           • Acquisitions, therefore, are an important method for pursuing strategies. However, they
             are not easy to carry out and they are sometimes adopted for misguided reasons. It is
             important to consider alternatives such as strategic alliances.



11.4 Strategic alliances
           M&A bring together companies through complete changes in ownership. However,
           companies also often work together in strategic alliances that involve collaboration with only
           partial changes in ownership, or no ownership changes at all as the parent companies remain
           distinct. Thus a strategic alliance is where two or more organisations share resources and
           activities to pursue a common strategy. This is a popular method among companies for
           pursuing strategy and can account for a significant portion of company revenues.23
              Alliance strategy challenges the traditional organisation-centred approach to strategy
           in at least two ways. First, practitioners of alliance strategy need to think about strategy
           in terms of the collective success of their networks as well as their individual organisa-
           tions’ self-interest.24 Collective strategy is about how the whole network of alliances,
           of which an organisation is a member, competes against rival networks of alliances.
           Thus for Microsoft, competitive success for its Xbox games console has relied heavily on the
           collective strength of its network of independent games developers such as Bungie Studios
           (makers of Halo), Crystal Dynamics (Tomb Raider), Rockstar North (Grand Auto Theft Auto V),
           Crytek Studios (Crysis 3) and The Coalition (Gears of War). Part of Microsoft’s strategy must
           include developing a stronger ecosystem of games developers than its rivals such as Sony
           and Nintendo. Collective strategy also challenges the individualistic approach to strategy by
           highlighting the importance of effective collaboration. Thus success involves collaborating
           as well as competing. Collaborative advantage is about managing alliances better than
           competitors.25 For Microsoft to maximise the value of the Xbox, it is not enough for it to
           have a stronger network than rivals such as Sony and Nintendo, but it must be better at
           working with its network in order to ensure that its members keep on producing the best
           games. The more effectively it collaborates, the more successful it will be. Illustration 11.3
           describes Apple’s approach to collective strategy and collaboration for the iPad.

           11.4.1 Types of strategic alliance
           In terms of ownership, there are two main kinds of strategic alliance:

           • Equity alliances involve the creation of a new entity that is owned separately by the
             partners involved. The most common form of equity alliance is the joint venture, where
             two organisations remain independent but set up a new organisation jointly owned by
             the parents. For example, Etihad Airways, founded in 2004, has grown rapidly to be the
             fifth largest airline largely through the creation of many equity alliances. These include
             agreements with Alitalia, Air Berlin, Air Serbia, Air Seychelles, Darwin Airlines and India’s
             Jet Airways. One form of equity alliance is a consortium alliance, which involves several
             partners setting up a venture together. For example, IBM, Hewlett-Packard, Toshiba and

                                                                                                        347

   Samsung are partners in the Sematech research consortium, working together on the
   latest semiconductor technologies.
• Non-equity alliances are typically looser, without the commitment implied by ownership.
  Non-equity alliances are often based on contracts. One common form of contractual alli-
  ance is franchising, where one organisation (the franchisor) gives another organisation
  (the franchisee) the right to sell the franchisor’s products or services in a particular location
  in return for a fee or royalty. Kall-Kwik printing, 7-Eleven convenience stores, McDonald’s
  restaurants and Subway are examples of franchising. Licensing is a similar kind of contrac-
  tual alliance, allowing partners to use intellectual property such as patents or brands
  in return for a fee. Long-term subcontracting agreements are another form of loose
  non-equity alliance, common in automobile supply. For example, the Canadian subcon-
  tractor Magna has long-term contracts to assemble the bodies and frames for car
  companies such as Ford, Honda and Mercedes.

   The public and voluntary sectors often get involved in both equity and non-equity stra-
tegic alliances. Governments have increasingly encouraged the public sector to contract
out the building and maintenance of capital projects such as hospitals and schools under
long-term contracts. Individual public organisations often band together to form purchasing
consortia as well. A good example of this is university libraries, which typically negotiate
collectively for the purchase of journals and books from publishers. Voluntary organisations
pool their resources in alliance too. For example, relief organisations in areas suffering from
natural or man-made disasters typically have to cooperate in order to deliver the full range
of services in difficult circumstances. Although public- and voluntary-sector organisations
might often be seen as more naturally cooperative than private-sector organisations, many
of the issues that follow apply to all three kinds of organisation.


11.4.2 Motives for alliances
Strategic alliances allow an organisation to rapidly extend its strategic advantage and gener-
ally require less commitment than other forms of expansion. A key motivator is sharing
resources or activities, although there may be less obvious reasons as well. Four broad ration-
ales for alliances can be identified, as summarised in Figure 11.4:

                    • Scale alliances. Here organisations combine in order to achieve necessary scale. The
                      capabilities of each partner may be quite similar (as indicated by the similarity of the A and
                      B organisations in Figure 11.4), but together they can achieve advantages that they could
                      not easily manage on their own. Thus combining together can provide economies of scale
                      in the production of outputs (products or services). Combining might also provide econ-
                      omies of scale in terms of inputs, for example by reducing purchasing costs of raw materials
                      or services. Thus health management organisations often combine together to negotiate
                      better prices with pharmaceutical companies. Finally, combining allows the partners to
                      share risk as well. Instead of organisations stretching themselves to find enough resources
                      on their own, partnering can help each partner avoid committing so many resources of its
                      own that failure would jeopardise the existence of the whole organisation.
                    • Access alliances. Organisations frequently ally in order to access the capabilities of another
                      organisation that are required in order to produce or sell their products and services. For
                      example, in countries such as China and India, a Western company (in Figure 11.4, organisation
                      A) might need to partner with a local distributor (organisation B) in order to access effectively
                      the national market for its products and services. Here organisation B is critical to organisation
                      A’s ability to sell. Access alliances can work in the opposite direction. Thus organisation B might
                      seek a licensing alliance in order to access inputs from organisation A, for example technolo-
                      gies or brands. Here organisation A is critical to organisation B’s ability to produce or market
                      its products and services. Access can be about tangible resources such as distribution channels
                      or products as well as intangible resources such as knowledge and social/political connections.
                    • Complementary alliances. These can be seen as a form of access alliance, but involve organisa-
                      tions at similar points in the value network combining their distinctive resources so that they
                      bolster each partner’s particular gaps or weaknesses. Figure 11.4 shows an alliance where
                      the strengths of organisation A (indicated by the darker shading) match the weaknesses
                      of organisation B (indicated by the lighter shading); conversely, the strengths of organisa-
                      tion B match the weaknesses of organisation A. By partnering, the two organisations can
                      bring together complementary strengths in order to overcome their individual weaknesses.
                      An example of this is the Nissan–Renault alliance where a complementarity lies in Renault
                      getting access to the Japanese car company’s manufacturing expertise, particularly in diesel
                      engines, while Nissan obtains access to European markets (see Illustration 11.4).
                    • Collusive alliances. Occasionally organisations secretly collude together in order to increase
                      their market power. By combining together into cartels, they reduce competition in the
                      marketplace, enabling them to extract higher prices from their customers or lower prices
                      from suppliers. Such collusive cartels among for-profit businesses are generally illegal,
                      so there is no public agreement between them (hence the absence of brackets joining
                      the two collusive organisations in Figure 11.4) and regulators will act to discourage this
                      activity. For instance, in 2017, Scania was fined €880m by the European Commission for
                      colluding with five other truck makers on prices and emissions costs. In not-for profit
                      sectors collusive alliances do take place and they may also be justified politically in sensi-
                      tive for-profit industries such as defence or aerospace due to national interests and where
                      the costs of development are far greater than an individual firm can sustain.

                       It can be seen that strategic alliances, like M&A, have mixed motives. Cooperation is often
                    a good thing, but it is important to be aware of collusive motivations. These are likely to work
                    against the interests of other competitors, customers and suppliers.


                    11.4.3 Strategic alliance processes
                    Like M&A, strategic alliances need to be understood as processes unfolding over time. Many
                    alliances are relatively short lived although there are examples of some which last for very long

periods indeed. For example, General Electric (USA) and SNECMA (France) have been partners
since 1974 in a continuous alliance for the development and production of small aero-engines –
this arrangement has been recently extended to 2040. The needs and capabilities of the
partners in a long-standing alliance such as this are bound to change over time. However, the
absence of full ownership means that emerging differences cannot simply be reconciled by
managerial authority; they have to be negotiated between independent partners. This lack of
control by one side or the other means the managerial processes in alliances are particularly
demanding. The management challenges, moreover, will change over time.
   The fact that neither partner is in control, while alliances must typically be managed over
time, highlights the importance of two themes in the various stages of the alliance process:

• Co-evolution. Rather than thinking of strategic alliances as fixed at a particular point of time,
  they are better seen as co-evolutionary processes.26 The concept of co-evolution under-
  lines the way in which partners, strategies, capabilities and environments are constantly
  changing. As they change, they need realignment so that they can evolve in harmony. A
  co-evolutionary perspective on alliances therefore places the emphasis on flexibility and
  change. At completion, an alliance is unlikely to be the same as envisaged at the start.
• Trust. Given the probable co-evolutionary nature of alliances, and the lack of control of
  one partner over the other, trust becomes highly important to the success of alliances
  over time.27 This comprises two parts: structural (which refers to the expectation that a
  partner will not act opportunistically) and behavioural (the degree of confidence a firm
  has in its partner’s reliability and integrity). All future possibilities cannot be specified in
  the initial alliance contract. Each partner will have made investments that are vulnerable
  to the selfish behaviour of the other. This implies the need for partners to behave in a
  trustworthy fashion through the whole lifetime of the alliance. Trust in a relationship is
  something that has to be continuously earned. Trust is often particularly fragile in alliances
  between the public and private sectors, where the profit motive is suspect on one side,
  and sudden shifts in political agendas are feared on the other.

    The themes of trust and co-evolution surface in various ways at different stages in the
lifespan of a strategic alliance. Figure 11.5 provides a simple stage model of strategic alliance

                          can be considered as for acquisitions (Section 11.3.4). However, because alliances do not
                          entail the same degree of control as acquisitions, mutual trust between partners will need
                          to be particularly strong right from the outset.
                        • Negotiation. Partners need of course to negotiate carefully their mutual roles at the outset.
                          In equity alliances, the partners also have to negotiate the proportion of ownership each
                          will have in the final joint venture, the profit share and managerial responsibilities. There
                          is likely to be a significant commitment of managerial time at this stage, as it is important
                          to get initial contracts clear and correct and it is worth spending time working out how
                          disputes during the life of the alliance will be resolved. Although the negotiation of owner-
                          ship proportions in a joint venture is similar to the valuation process in acquisitions, strategic
                          alliance contracts generally involve a great deal more. Key behaviours required of each
                          partner need to be specified upfront. However, a ruthless negotiation style can also damage
                          trust going forward. Moreover, co-evolution implies the need to anticipate change. In an
                          acquired unit, it is possible to make adjustments simply by managerial authority. In alliances,
                          initial contracts may be considered binding even when starting conditions have changed.
                          It is wise to include an option for renegotiating initial terms right at the outset.
                        • Start-up. This involves considerable investment of material and human resources and
                          trust is very important. First, the initial operation of the alliance puts the original alliance
                          agreements to the test. Informal adjustments to working realities are likely to be required.
                          Also, people from outside the original negotiation team are typically now obliged to work
                          together on a day-to-day basis. They may not have the same understanding of the alliance
                          as those who initiated it. Without the mutual trust to make adjustments and smooth
                          misunderstandings, the alliance is liable to break up. This early period in an alliance’s
                          evolution is the one with the highest rate of failure.
                        • Maintenance. This refers to the ongoing operation of the strategic alliance, with increasing
                          resources likely to be committed. The lesson of co-evolution is that alliance maintenance is
                          not a simple matter of stability. Alliances have to be actively managed to allow for changing
                          external circumstances. The internal dynamics of the partnership are likely to evolve as the
                          partners build experience. Here again trust is extremely important. Gary Hamel has warned

                                                                                                                                  353
Chapter 11 Mergers, acquisitions and alliances


                       that alliances often become ‘competitions for competence.’28 Because partners are inter-
                       acting closely, they can begin to learn each other’s particular competences. This learning
                       can develop into a competition for competence, with the partner that learns the fastest
                       becoming the more powerful. The more powerful partner may consequently be able to
                       renegotiate the terms in its favour or even break up the alliance and go it alone. If, on the
                       other hand, the partners wish to maintain their strategic alliance, trustworthy behaviour
                       that does not threaten the other partner’s competence is essential to maintaining the
                       cooperative relationships necessary for the day-to-day working of the alliance.
                    • Termination. Often an alliance will have had an agreed time span or purpose right from
                      the start, so termination is a matter of completion rather than failure. Here separation
                      is amicable. Sometimes the alliance has been so successful that the partners will wish
                      to extend the alliance by agreeing a new alliance between themselves, committing
                      still more resources. Sometimes too the alliance will have been more of a success for
                      one party than the other, with one partner wishing to buy the other’s share in order to
                      commit fully, while the other partner decides to sell out. The sale of one party’s interest
                      need not be a sign of failure as their strategic agenda may have changed since alliance
                      formation. However, sometimes it can end in bitter divorce (see Illustration 11.4). Termin-
                      ation needs to be managed carefully, therefore. Co-evolution implies that mutual trust is
                      likely to be valuable after the completion of any particular partnership. Partners may be
                      engaged in several different joint projects at the same time. For example, Cisco and IBM
                      are partners on multiple simultaneous projects in wireless communications, IT security,
                      data centres and data storage. The partners may need to come together again for new
                      projects in the future. Thus Nokia, Ericsson and Siemens have had mobile telephone tech-
                      nology joint projects since the mid-1990s. Maintaining mutual trust in the termination
                      stage is vital if partners are to co-evolve through generations of multiple projects.

                    Like M&A, alliances exhibit high rates of failure of up to 70 per cent where they fail to meet
                    the goals of parent companies.29 There is some evidence that prior experience with joint
                    ventures helps overall performance, especially if an alliance capability is created.30 It may take
                    many years to gradually introduce alliance management processes. For an alliance capability
                    to succeed there needs to be consistent sponsorship and support from top management.



11.5 Comparing acquisitions, alliances and
     organic development
                    It is clear that all three methods of M&A, strategic alliances and organic development have
                    their own advantages and disadvantages. There are also some similarities. This section first
                    considers criteria for choosing between the three methods, and then draws together some
                    key success factors for M&A and alliances.


                    11.5.1 Buy, ally or DIY?
                    Very many, perhaps as much as half of M&A and strategic alliances, fail. Acquisitions can
                    go wrong because of excessive initial valuations, exaggerated expectations of strategic fit,
                    underestimated problems of organisational fit and all the other issues pointed to in this
                    chapter. Alliances also suffer from miscalculations in terms of strategic and organisational
                    fit, but, given the lack of control on either side, have their own particular issues of trust and
                    co-evolution as well. With these high failure rates, acquisitions and alliances need to be
                    considered cautiously alongside the default option of organic development (do-it-yourself).

                                    11.5 Comparing acquisitions, alliances and organic development


   The best approach will differ according to circumstances. Figure 11.6 presents a ‘buy, ally
or DIY’ decision tree that can help in choosing between acquisitions, alliances and organic
development based upon three key factors:31

• Urgency. Acquisitions are a rapid method for pursuing a strategy. Illustration 11.2 shows
  how Google expanded rapidly through making many acquisitions – something that might
  have taken far longer if attempted organically. Alliances too may accelerate strategy
  delivery by accessing additional resources or skills, though usually less quickly than a
  simple acquisition. Typically organic development (DIY) is slowest: everything has to be
  made from scratch.
• Uncertainty. It is often better to choose the alliance route where there is high uncertainty
  in terms of the markets or technologies involved. On the upside, if the markets or tech-
  nologies turn out to be a success, it might be possible to turn the alliance into a full acqui-
  sition, especially if a buy option has been included in the initial alliance contract. If the
  venture turns out a failure, then at least the loss is shared with the alliance partner. Acqui-
  sitions may also be resold if they fail but often at a much lower price than the original
  purchase. On the other hand, a failed organic development might have to be written off
  entirely, with no sale value, because the business unit involved has never been on the
  market beforehand.
• Type of resources and capabilities. Acquisitions work best when the desired resources or
  capabilities are ‘hard’, for example physical investments in manufacturing facilities. Hard
  resources such as factories are easier to put a value on in the bidding process than ‘soft’
  resources such as people or brands. Hard resources are also typically easier to control
  post-acquisition than people and skills. If Anbang’s bid for Starwood (see Illustration 11.1)
  is entirely about real estate acquisition, then cultural difficulties are likely to be minimal.
  However greater ‘soft’ integration might pose the risk of significant cultural problems.
  Sometimes too the acquiring company’s own image can tarnish the brand image of the
  target company. Acquisition of soft resources and competences should be approached

Chapter 11 Mergers, acquisitions and alliances


                       with great caution. Indeed, the DIY organic method is typically the most effective with
                       sensitive soft capabilities such as people. Internal ventures are likely to be culturally
                       consistent at least. Even alliances can involve culture clashes between people from the
                       two sides, and it is harder to control an alliance partner than an acquired unit.

                    There may also be other factors that might be included in the decision tree such as the
                    modularity of capabilities. For instance, if the capabilities being sought reside in a clearly
                    defined part of the proposed partner’s organisation, and assuming that section would not
                    be for sale, then an alliance with that part of the business would make sense, leaving the
                    partners to run the rest of their businesses independently. There is no need to buy the whole
                    organisation. The DIY method could be effective if there is time, as the new business could
                    be developed under the umbrella of a distinct ‘new venture division’ (see Section 10.5.2),
                    rather than involving the whole organisation.
                       Of course, the choice between the three options of buy, ally and DIY is not unconstrained.
                    Frequently there are no suitable acquisition targets or alliance partners available. The key
                    message of Figure 11.6 remains nonetheless: it is important to weigh up the available options
                    systematically and to avoid favouring one or the other without careful analysis.


                    11.5.2 Key success factors
                    Figure 11.6 indicates that, despite high failure rates, M&A and strategic alliances can still
                    be the best option in certain circumstances. The question then is how to manage M&A and
                    alliances as effectively as possible.
                        Strategic fit is critical in both M&A and alliances. The target or the partner should suit
                    the desired strategy. As in Section 11.3.4, it is very easy to overestimate synergies – and
                    neglect negative synergies – in alliances as well as M&A. However, organisational fit is
                    vital as well, in both cases. In particular, cultural differences are hard to manage, espe-
                    cially where people resources are important. Because of the lack of control, organisational
                    fit issues are liable to be even harder to manage in alliances than in acquisitions, where
                    the ownership rights of the buyer at least provide some managerial authority. Valuation
                    likewise is a crucial issue in both M&A and equity alliances. Acquisitions are liable to the
                    ‘winner’s curse’ (Section 11.3.4) of excessive valuation, particularly where there have been
                    bid battles between competitors. But even alliance partners need to assess their relative
                    contributions accurately in order to ensure that they do not commit too many resources
                    with too little return and too little control.
                        M&A and alliances each raise some very distinct issues to manage. At the start of the
                    process, alliances rely on courtship between willing partners, whereas that need not be the
                    same for M&A. Mergers do require mutual willingness of course, but, if negotiations go
                    poorly, there often remains the option of the hostile takeover bid. The process of a hostile bid
                    is principally about persuading shareholders rather than talking with the target’s managers.
                    In M&A, a crucial issue is the right approach to integration: absorption, preservation, symbi-
                    osis, intensive care, re-orientation. In strategic alliances, the option to fully integrate the two
                    partners into a single whole does not exist. Rather the task is the continued maintenance
                    of a partnership between independent organisations that must co-evolve. Finally, divesture
                    of acquired units and the termination of alliances tend to differ. Divestures are typically
                    one-off transactions with purchasers, with limited consequences for future relationships.
                    On the other hand, the way in which alliances are terminated may have repercussions for
                    important future relationships, as new projects and simultaneous projects often involve the
                    same partners. In sum, it can be seen that the necessity for courtship, co-evolution and sensi-
                    tive termination frequently makes the strategic alliance process a much more delicate one
                    than simple acquisition.

                        Summary
                        • There are three broad methods for pursuing a growth strategy: M&A, strategic alliances
                          and organic development.
                        • Organic development can be either continuous or radical. Radical organic development is
                          termed corporate entrepreneurship.
                        • Acquisitions can be hostile or friendly. Strategies for M&A can contain elements that are
                          strategic, financial or managerial.
                        • The acquisition process includes target choice, valuation and integration.
                        • Strategic alliances can be equity or non-equity. Key motives for strategic alliances include
                          scale, access, complementarity and collusion.
                        • The strategic alliance process relies on co-evolution and trust.
                        • The choice between acquisition, alliance and organic methods is influenced by three key
                          factors: urgency, uncertainty and type of capabilities.

                        Work assignments
                        ✱ Denotes more advanced work assignments.
                        * Refers to a case study in the Text and Cases edition.

                        11.1   Write a short (about ten lines) statement to a chief executive who has asked you to advise
                               whether or not the company should develop through M&A. Write a similar statement to
                               a chief executive of a hospital who is considering possible mergers with other hospitals.
                        11.2✱ For a recently announced acquisition, track the share prices (using www.bigcharts.com
                              for example) of both the acquiring firm and the target firm in the period surrounding
                              the bid. What do you conclude from the behaviour of the share prices about how
                              investors regard the bid? Which company’s investors are likely to benefit more?
                        11.3✱ For a recently announced acquisition, or for the acquisition of Argos by Sainsbury’s
                              in the end of chapter case, or Nest by Google (Illustration 11.2), explain which
                              post-acquisition integration approach might be most appropriate in these situations
                              and why other integration approaches may be less effective.
                        11.4✱ With reference to either the contested bid for Starwood (Illustration 11.1), Mega-
                              brew*, the acquisition of Neuromag by Elektra*, or end of chapter case ‘Future
                              proof’, explain why, when the objectives are the mutual creation of value, acquirers
                              choose to make acquisitions rather than alliances.
                        11.5✱ Which development approach is a family-owned company likely to prefer? Explain
                              your reasoning.

                        Integrative assignment
                        11.6✱ With so many M&A failing, explain why managers continue to transact these deals.
                              In particular, consider alternative methods for strategic re-alignment that may be
                              available to an organisation as well as the possible consequences of a company not
                              using M&A. Now interpret your answer in terms of all the stakeholders who may be
                              affected by an M&A transaction. What conclusions can you draw?

Commentary on
Part II Strategic choices
                      The central concern of Part II has been the strategic choices available to organisations,
                      including business strategy and models, diversification, internationalisation, new ventures
                      and innovation, acquisitions and alliances. Although the chapters provide various rationales
                      and evidence for these strategic choices, this book recognises that the decisions between
                      them are often not wholly objective and rational. Indeed, the four contrasting ‘strategy
                      lenses’ (introduced in the Commentary at the end of Part I) each propose very different
                      expectations about strategic decisions. This Commentary applies the same four lenses to
                      the issues raised in Part II, focused on strategic choices. The four lenses raise questions about
                      how to generate the options for strategic choice, assumptions about other organisations,
                      and what is likely to matter in the success of various options.

      The design lens places high value on extensive information search and analysis for generating strategic options.
      Logical, optimal choices are important. The design lens therefore recommends you to:

      • Consider all options: strategy choices should be made between a large initial range, with techniques such as
        the Ansoff growth matrix (Chapter 8.2) used to generate options.
      • Ensure fit between choice and purpose: preferred options should be checked carefully for consistency with
        stakeholders’ interests and goals (Chapter 5).
      • Maximise returns: the optimal choice is one that maximises the returns on investment, whether that is invest-
        ment of capital or effort (Chapter 12).




      Experience lens
      In this view, strategy develops incrementally based on the past history and culture of the organisation and its
      members. So the set of strategic options to choose from is unlikely to be comprehensive and cultural factors
      can generate behaviours different from those that might be expected on a simplistically rational point of view.
      You should therefore:

      • Challenge standard responses: for example, just because a particular diversification option (Chapter 8) or
        international entry mode (Chapter 9) has always worked before, does not mean that the same should be
        done again.
      • Respect cultural differences: in integrating acquisitions (Chapter 11), cooperating with alliance partners
        (Chapter 11) or going international (Chapter 9), the experience lens suggests it is very important to take
        account of the other organisation’s history and culture, as well as more objective factors.
      • Adjust competitor analysis: if experience shapes strategy, simple analyses of competitor interaction, as some-
        times in game theory (Chapter 7), may need to be adjusted in order to avoid exaggerating the likely speed
        of competitors’ moves or making excessive assumptions about the rationality of their responses.

                      This commentary therefore reconsiders some of the issues of Part II in the light of the four
                   strategy lenses. Note that:

                   • There is no suggestion here that any one of these lenses is better than the others. It is
                     usually beneficial to explore strategic options using more than one lens, in order to get
                     more than one point of view.
                   • For a deeper understanding of this Commentary, you might want to review the Part I
                     Commentary, following Chapter 5, which provides a fuller introduction of the four lenses,
                     plus an illustrative case.




Variety lens
The emphasis here is on the variety and spontaneity of strategic options and their possible origins in the organ-
isational periphery. The variety lens is orientated towards innovation. Thus the variety lens encourages you to:

• Look beyond top management: from a variety lens point of view, the strategies generated by top management
  are liable to be limited, so you should look more broadly for ideas about strategic options, for instance by
  using ‘open innovation’ or ‘market pull’ approaches (Chapter 10).
• Learn from acquisitions and partners: if the top has no monopoly of wisdom, exploring acquired units or
  alliance partners (Chapter 11) for underappreciated initiatives or capabilities might uncover new strategic
  options going far beyond what was planned in the original acquisition or alliance.
• Expect surprises: in an environment liable to spontaneous innovation, you should be sensitive to the potential
  for sudden ‘disruptive innovations’ and consider holding a strong portfolio of ‘real options’ (Chapter 10).




Discourse lens
According to this lens, the strategic options that rise to the surface will typically be shaped by the legitimate
discourse of the organisation and the underlying self-interest of various managers. The discourse lens recognises
the power of language. So you should:

• Watch your language: attend to discursive framing of your strategic options, recognising the emotional reson-
  ance of labels such as ‘star’ and ‘dog’ in portfolio analyses for instance (Chapter 8) and the different meanings
  such labels might have in various national cultures (Chapter 10).
• Distrust others’ language: strategic options that draw heavily on apparently legitimate or fashionable
  discourses such as synergy (Chapter 8), innovation and entrepreneurship (Chapter 9) or partnership and
  ecosystems (Chapter 11) should be probed particularly critically for shaky reasoning or self-interested motives.
• Look out for managerial interests: the discourse with which strategic options are framed may hide managerial
  self-interest, especially in regard to strategies such as unrelated diversification (Chapter 8) or aggressive
  acquisitions (Chapter 11) that often perform badly for shareholders.

Strategy in action
This part explains:
• Criteria and techniques that can be used to
  evaluate organisational performance and
  strategic options.
• How strategies develop in organisations; in
  particular, the processes that may give rise to
  intended strategies or to emergent strategies.
• The way in which organisational structures and
  systems of control are important in organising for
  strategic success.
• The leadership and management of strategic
  change.
• Who strategists are and what they do in practice.
Introduction to Part III
        The first two parts of the book have been concerned with how a strategist can think through
        and manage better the strategic position of an organisation and the strategic choices avail-
        able to it. In this part of the book the focus moves to strategy in action. It is concerned with
        how a strategy actually takes shape in an organisation and what strategists do.
           The next chapter, Chapter 12, explains ways in which managers can assess the perform-
        ance of the strategic options introduced in Part II and then evaluate alternatives. It stresses
        both economic and non-economic performance measures and then introduces three criteria
        to apply in making further choices. Suitability asks whether a strategy addresses the key
        issues relating to the opportunities and constraints an organisation faces. Acceptability asks
        whether a strategy meets the expectations of stakeholders. And feasibility invites an explicit
        consideration of whether a strategy could work in practice. In each case tools and techniques
        of evaluation are provided, explained and illustrated.
           Chapter 13 examines two broadly different explanations of how strategies actually develop
        in organisations. Do strategies come about in organisations through a sequence of first anal-
        ysis and then implementation? In other words, do strategies develop on the basis of delib-
        erate intent? Or is strategy more emergent, for example on the basis of people’s experience
        or as a result of responses to competitive action? And what are the implications of these
        different explanations for managing strategy?
           Chapter 14 considers the relationship between strategy and how an organisation func-
        tions in terms of people working with each other within different structures and systems.
        These structures and systems may be formally established by management or may be more
        informal relationships; but they will all affect the organisation’s ability to deliver its strategy.
        The chapter considers how successful organising requires these various elements to work
        together in order to create mutually reinforcing configurations of structures and systems that
        are matched to an organisation’s strategies.
           The development of a new strategy may also require significant change for an organ-
        isation and this is the theme of Chapter 15. The leadership of strategic change is exam-
        ined, first by acknowledging that managing change is not the same in all organisations; in
        other words, change context matters. The chapter then examines different approaches to
        managing change, including styles of managing change and the variety of levers employed
        to manage strategic change. The chapter concludes by revisiting the importance of context
        to consider how different levers might be employed in different change contexts.
           This part of the book then concludes by discussing what strategists themselves actually
        do. It examines three issues in the practice of strategy. The first is: who gets included in
        strategy-making activities? Participants in strategy-making can be managers at all levels, with
        consultants and planners too. Second, what activities do strategists get involved in: these
        range from selling strategic issues to strategy communications. Lastly, there are the kinds
        of methodologies that strategists use, including strategy workshops, projects, hypothesis
        testing and business plans.

12.1 Introduction
          In 2018, Chief Executive Heinrich Hiesinger of Thyssenkrupp, the product of merging two
          large German steel companies, resigned. He had presided over the company’s exit from steel
          but the company’s share price had fallen 28 per cent since he took office in January 2011.
          Investors pushed for the break-up of the company that now encompassed submarines, eleva-
          tors and car parts, as they felt it suffered from a conglomerate discount. Newly appointed
          CEO Guido Kerkhoff is now planning to split the company and is firing managers who stand
          in his way. His strategy needs to address two key questions: what level of performance must
          be achieved, and what criteria should he use to evaluate his options?
              This chapter is about assessing current organisational performance and evaluating
          different strategic options. It follows the focus in Part II on various strategic choices such
          as differentiation, diversification, internationalisation, innovation and acquisitions. Now
          it is time to consider how to judge these strategies. Managers have to assess how well
          their existing strategies are performing and evaluate alternatives. This chapter focuses
          on the use of systematic criteria and techniques for objective analysis – a rational ‘Design’
          perspective (see the Strategy Lenses in the Commentary to Part 1). Chapter 13 considers
          the role of such formal methods within the complex processes of strategy development as
          a whole.
              In this chapter we consider a range of organisational performance measures, both
          economic measures and broader measures of organisational effectiveness. We address
          the question of performance comparators: in other words, what should an organisation’s
          performance be compared to. We also introduce gap analysis as a tool for assessing depar-
          tures from desired levels of performance. Gap analysis can be used as well to identify the
          scale of the strategic initiatives needed in order to close the gap between actual and desired
          levels of performance. The chapter goes on to propose four criteria for systematically evalu-
          ating possible strategic initiatives, summarised by the acronym SAFE: Suitability, Accept-
          ability, Feasibility, Evaluation. Suitability assesses whether a strategy addresses key strategic
          challenges an organisation faces, Acceptability determines whether a strategy meets stake-
          holder expectations, Feasibility examines its practicality and Evaluation synthesises these
          assessments for the most optimal strategy, as the results for each often suggest different
          strategies to take forwards.
              Figure 12.1 organises the key elements of this chapter. Here managers first assess perform-
          ance; next they identify the extent of any gap between desired and actual or projected
          performance; finally they assess the strategic options for filling any such gap. The adopted
          options themselves eventually feed back into performance in the future.

12.2 Organisational performance
                    There are many techniques for measuring organisational performance, with diverse organ-
                    isations preferring different measures. However they broadly fall into two categories of
                    economic and effectiveness measures, with economic ones being far more widely used.
                    Economic measures suffer from limitations that are discussed below and which the broader
                    effectiveness measures attempt to address. This section therefore introduces both direct
                    economic and effectiveness measures and goes on to consider various comparisons against
                    which performance may be assessed. It finally discusses gap analysis.


                    12.2.1 Performance measures
                    We can distinguish between two basic approaches to performance: direct economic perform-
                    ance and overall organisational effectiveness.1

                    • Economic performance refers to direct measures of success in terms of economic outcomes.
                      These economic outcomes have three main dimensions:
                       • Performance in product markets: for example, sales growth or market share, or for
                         not-for-profits this might be growth in membership or money raised for charities. Vari-
                         ations in these figures may be seen as a lead indicator of a company’s competitiveness
                         in its market.
                       • Accounting measures of profitability, such as profit margin or return on capital
                         employed (ROCE). A useful technique for unpacking the drivers of company profit-
                         ability is the Du Pont model (see Figure 12.2), which dissects a company’s return on
                         capital employed (ROCE) in order to work out the components that add value to,
                         or subtract from the whole. It is particularly powerful in tracking changes over time
                         and in comparison with competitor ratios. For instance, looking at selling, general and
                         administrative expenses in Figure 12.2; if these are increasing over time, and particu-
                         larly if these seem high in relation to competitors’ figures, then the profitability of the
                         business would be improved if attention was paid to reducing these sorts of adminis-
                         trative costs (see also Section 12.4.2 below).
                       • Financial market measures such as movements in share price. Companies watch their
                         share price carefully as it is a key indicator of market sentiment of the expected future
                         success of an organisation. As in the opening example of ThyssenKrupp, the precipitate
                         fall in its share price showed the market’s lack of confidence in the company’s strategy
                         and its CEO Heinrich Hiesinger.

                       These economic measures may seem objective, but they can be conflicting and need
                    careful interpretation. Sales growth, for example, may be achieved by cutting prices, thereby
                    reducing profit margins. For ThysseenKrupp, although in 2018 sales were increasing from
                    €30.8bn to €31.7bn, net results and share price were down significantly. This means that
                    different performance measures may point in different directions and so economic perform-
                    ance is best evaluated by more than one measure. It is also why many organisations are now
                    looking to more comprehensive measures of effectiveness as well.

                    • Effectiveness refers to a broader set of performance criteria than just economic, for
                      example measures reflecting internal operational efficiency or measures relevant to stake-
                      holders such as employees and external communities. One important broad technique for
                      assessing effectiveness is the balanced scorecard.

   • The balanced scorecard considers four perspectives on performance simultaneously in
     order to prevent the dominance of a single perspective.2 Thus it considers the i) finan-
     cial perspective, which for a for-profit company typically means focusing upon increasing
     shareholder value. This can be achieved through revenue growth and productivity gains,
     such as cost reduction and efficiency gains. Typical measures include profitability or share-
     price performance; ii) customer perspective, as this defines how a company differenti-
     ates itself from competitors in the market. This can be assessed using measures such as
     customer satisfaction or product quality; iii) internal business perspective, focuses upon
     alignment between organisational processes and financial and customer perspectives.
     Here productivity measures or project management measures are often used. Often poor
     alignment between the internal perspective and the financial and customer perspectives
     leads to poor outcomes as a company intending to compete on innovation and value-
     added customer relationships is unlikely to do well if internal focus is upon cost reduc-
     tion; and finally the iv) innovation and learning perspective, which assesses the employee
     capabilities and skills and corporate climate needed to support a strategy. Typical measures
     include new product introductions or employee skills so that human resources and infor-
     mation technology align with the other perspectives. The performance measures of each
     perspective can be cascaded down through the organisation to individual business units
     to allow overall alignment. This can be visualised using a strategy map,3 which is a logical
     and comprehensive architecture that specifies critical elements and their links to an organ-
     isation’s strategy. By integrating overall financial goals with strategic and operational
     targets, the balance score card ensures that the pursuit of short-run financial goals is not
     at the expense of the longer-term strategic positioning of the company.

                       • Another similarly broad measure of performance is the triple bottom line, which pays
                         explicit attention to corporate social responsibility and the environment. Thus the triple
                         bottom line has three dimensions: economic measures of performance such as sales, profits
                         and share price; social measures, such as employee training, health and safety and contribu-
                         tions to the local community; and finally environmental measures such as pollution, recy-
                         cling and wastage targets. Most listed companies today publish sustainability reports and
                         Dutch brewer Heineken4 is a good example, showing the company’s standing on the Dow
                         Jones sustainability index and lists specific social metrics for employees (reducing accident
                         frequency, training, employee volunteering) and environmental metrics (water usage, CO2
                         emissions and energy consumption). Both the balanced scorecard and the triple bottom line
                         share a view that overall effectiveness depends not only on economic performance, but on
                         a range of factors that support the long-term prosperity of the organisation.



                    12.2.2 Performance comparisons
                    When considering performance, it is important to be clear about what you are measuring against:
                    in other words, performance relative to what? There are three main comparisons to consider:

                    • Organisational targets: a key set of performance criteria are management’s own targets,
                      whether expressed in terms of overall vision and mission or more specific objectives, for
                      instance economic outcomes such as sales growth or profitability. Investors are particularly
                      sensitive to performance against financial criteria such as earnings targets. Failure to meet
                      expectations set by these targets often leads to the dismissal of the organisation’s Chief
                      Executive or Chief Financial Officer.5 Returning to the ThyssenKrupp example at the start
                      of this chapter, it was probably the long-term decline in share price performance that
                      precipitated the resignation of CEO Hiesinger. Performance against organisational targets
                      can be approached via gap analysis, as in Section 12.2.3 below.
                    • Trends over time: investors and other stakeholders are clearly concerned about whether perfor-
                      mance is improving or declining over time. Improvement may suggest good strategy and
                      increasing momentum into the future. Decline may suggest poor strategy and the need for
                      change. However, it is important to take a relevant time period for comparing trends: except in
                      very fast changing markets, it is typically useful to examine trends over several years in order to
                      smooth out short-run cyclical effects, for example. Note too that performance trends are rarely
                      sustained. It has been shown that only about 5 per cent of firms are able to sustain superior
                      performance for as long as ten years.6 From this perspective, one predictor of future declines
                      in performance is an extended period of good performance in preceding years.
                    • Comparable organisations: the final comparison is performance relative to other similar
                      organisations, as in benchmarking (Section 4.4.4). These are typically competitors, but
                      where there are no competitors, or where it is useful to encourage new approaches,
                      comparators can be other organisations doing equivalent things (for example, a utility
                      company might compare its efficiency in billing and customer service with an insurance
                      company). For established companies, it is often possible to compare with competitors’
                      performance using accounting measures such as profitability or sales growth. Again, the
                      trend over an extended time period is generally useful. Similarly, it is possible for quoted
                      companies to compare their share-price performance against that of specific competi-
                      tors, or against an index of competitors in the same industry, or against the overall index
                      for the stock market in which they are quoted (this is the stock market in which they
                      are competing for investor support). A sustained decline in relative share price typically
                      implies falling investor confidence in future performance. Note that comparison against
                      individual star performers can often be misleading. Because financial returns are typically
                      related to risk, high performers may simply have undertaken risky strategies, which it

  might be unwise to imitate.7 The results of firms that have undertaken the similar strat-
  egies but finally gone bankrupt or been taken over are unavailable for comparison.



12.2.3 Gap analysis
Gap analysis compares actual or projected performance with desired performance.8 It is
useful for identifying performance shortfalls (‘gaps’) and, when involving projections, can
help in anticipating future problems. The size of the gap provides a guide to the extent to
which strategy needs to be changed. Figure 12.3 shows a gap analysis where the vertical
axis is some measure of performance (for example, sales growth or profitability) and the
horizontal axis shows time, both up to ‘today’ and into the future. The upper line represents
the organisation’s desired performance, perhaps a set of targets or the standard set by
competitor organisations. The lower line represents both achieved performance to today,
and projected performance based on a continuation of the existing strategy into the future
(this is necessarily an estimate). In Figure 12.3, there is already a gap between achieved and
desired performance: performance is clearly unsatisfactory.
   However, the gap in Figure 12.3 is projected to become even bigger on the basis of the
existing strategy. Assuming ongoing commitment to the desired level of performance, the
organisation clearly needs to adjust its existing strategy in order to close the gap. We shall
introduce a number of ways for evaluating strategic options in these and equivalent circum-
stances later in the chapter.


12.2.4 Complexities of performance analysis
Before considering strategy evaluation, we should underline the complex nature of perform-
ance analysis. We have already indicated how some measures might be contradictory in the
short term at least: for example, sales growth can be obtained by reducing profit margins.
Multi-dimensional measures of effectiveness such as the balanced scorecard or the triple
bottom line are particularly subject to trade-offs: it is easy to see how cutting back on costly
environmental protection policies could improve short-term profits.
   However, there are three further sources of possible complexity. First, organisations are
liable to manipulate outcomes in order to meet key performance indicators.9 For example,
organisations can defer non-urgent expenditures or book sales orders early in order to meet
short-term earnings targets. These actions are attractive to companies seeking to be acquired.
Second, organisations can legitimately manage performance perceptions and expectations:

                       introduced in Parts 1 and 2 of this book. However, at the most basic level, a suitability anal-
                       ysis involves assessing the extent to which a proposed strategy:

                       • exploits the opportunities in the environment and avoids the threats; and
                       • capitalises on the organisation’s strengths and avoids or remedies the weaknesses.

                          The concepts and frameworks already discussed in Chapters 2 to 6 can be especially
                       helpful in understanding suitability. Some examples are shown in Table 12.2; other frame-
                       works and techniques from Part 1 could be used in equivalent ways. However, the various
                       techniques will raise many issues. It is therefore important that the key strategic issues are
                       identified from among all these. A major skill of a strategist is to be able to work out what
                       really matters. Strategy is about priorities; long lists should be avoided.
                          The discussions about possible strategic choices in Part II were concerned not only
                       with understanding what choices might be available to organisations but also providing
                       reasons why each might be considered. So the examples in those sections also illustrate why
                       strategies might be regarded as suitable. Table 12.3 summarises these points from earlier
                       sections (particularly Chapters 8 and 11) and provides examples of reasons why strategies
                       might be regarded as suitable. There are, however, also a number of screening techniques
                       that can be used to assess the suitability of proposed strategies by reviewing their relative
                       merits against key opportunities and constraints.


                       12.3.1 Ranking and screening
                       Here possible strategies are assessed against key factors relating to the strategic position of
                       the organisation and a score (or ranking) established for each option. For example, Illustra-
                       tion 12.2 shows how each strategic option for Heineken either addresses, doesn’t deal with,

                    the advantages of this approach is that it forces a debate about the implications and impacts
                    of specific key factors on specific strategic proposals. Ranking therefore helps overcome the
                    unconscious biases of each individual manager.
                       More sophisticated approaches to ranking can assign weightings to factors in recognition
                    that some will be of more importance in the evaluation than others. It should, however, be
                    remembered that assigning numbers, of itself, is not a basis of evaluation; any scoring or
                    weighting is only a reflection of the quality of the analysis and debate that goes into the
                    scoring.
                       Strategic options can also be considered against a range of future scenarios (see
                    Section 2.4) where a high degree of uncertainty exists. Suitable options are ones that make
                    sense in terms of the various scenarios. As a result of such analysis it may be that several stra-
                    tegic options need to be ‘kept open’, perhaps in the form of contingency plans. Or it could
                    be that an option being considered is found to be suitable in different scenarios. Indeed a
                    criterion of strategy evaluation for the energy company Shell is that a chosen strategy needs
                    to be suitable in terms of a range of different crude oil prices.
                       One of the other advantages of screening through scenarios is that, as managers screen
                    the possible strategies in terms of the different scenarios, they come to see which would
                    be most suitable in different environmental contexts. This can then sensitise managers to
                    the need for changes in strategy, or changes in strategic emphasis, given changes in the
                    environment.

                         One of the key issues in evaluating a strategy is whether it is likely to draw on the organisa-
                      tion’s bases of competitive advantage. Quite possibly the factors relating to this may already
                      have been built into the ranking exercises explained above. However, if they have not, then
                      it may be sensible to consider this question specifically.
                         As Chapter 4 shows, the likely bases of competitive advantage reside in the strategic
                      resources and capabilities of an organisation. Screening for bases of competitive advantage
                      therefore requires an analysis of how the proposed strategy is underpinned by resources and
                      capabilities that satisfy the VRIO criteria (see Chapter 4). The various strategic options can
                      be compared systematically against VRIO’s four criteria in a simple matrix, with the options
                      as horizontal rows and the individual VRIO criteria as columns.

                      Decision trees can also be used to assess strategic options against a list of key factors.

                         requirements that must be met (such as growth, investment or diversity). Illustration 12.3
                         provides an example. The end point of the decision tree is a number of development oppor-
                         tunities. The elimination process is achieved by identifying a few key elements or criteria
                         that possible strategies need to achieve. In Illustration 12.3 these are perceptions of market
                         demand, level of new competitor threat and intended resource commitment. As the illus-
                         tration shows, anticipating a sustained fall in market demand suggests that future strategy
                         should rank options 1–4 more highly than options 5–8. At the second step, the higher
                         perceived threat of new competitors would rank options 1 and 2 above 3 and 4, but a lack
                         of willingness to commit significant resources to the new strategy would suggest an inter-
                         national alliance may be the best way forward. The danger here is that the choice at each
                         branch on the tree can tend to be simplistic. For example, as the illustration points out,
                         answering ‘yes’ or ŉo’ to resource commitment does not allow for the wide variety of options
                         that might exist within this strategy.

12.4 Acceptability
                       Acceptability is concerned with whether the expected performance outcomes of a
                       proposed strategy meet the expectations of stakeholders. These can be of three types,
                       the ‘3 Rs’: Return, Risk and stakeholder Reactions. It is sensible to use more than one approach
                       in assessing the acceptability of a strategy.


                       12.4.1 Return
                       The first R is returns. These are measures of the financial profitability and effectiveness
                       of a strategy. In the private sector, investors and shareholders expect a financial return on
                       their investment. In the public sector, funders (typically government departments) are likely
                       to measure returns in terms of the ‘value for money’ of services delivered. Attention often
                       focuses on financial metrics of efficiency but measuring return for not-for-profits is notori-
                       ously difficult as there is great diversity in the sector in terms of multiple, often conflicting,

            The exact specification of these metrics will vary by not-for-profit organisation.11
               Measures of return are a common way of assessing proposed new ventures or major pro-
            jects within businesses. An assessment of the financial effectiveness of any specific strategy
            should be a key criterion of acceptability.

            Financial analysis12
            There are four common approaches to financial return (see Figure 12.4):
               Return on capital employed (ROCE) calculates profitability in relation to capital for a
            specific time period after a new strategy is in place (see Figure 12.2 for ROCE drivers). For
            the example in Figure 12.4(a) a ROCE of 10 per cent is anticipated by year 3. The ROCE (typic-
            ally profit before interest and tax – PBIT – divided by capital employed) is a measure of the
            earning power of the capital resources used in implementing a particular strategic option
            (see Section 12.5.1 below). Its weakness is that it does not focus on cash flow or the timing of
            cash flows (see the explanation of DCF below). A similar measure is return on invested capital

                    (ROIC), famously used by Michael Porter (2008) as a method to determine the extent of a
                    company’s competitive advantage. It has the attraction, as used by Porter, to enable compar-
                    ison across companies in a particular industry to assess relative performance. Expressed as a
                    formula it is ROIC = Net operating profits after tax/total invested capital. For other measures

                    • The payback period assesses the length of time it takes before the cumulative cash flows
                      for a strategic option become positive. In the example in Figure 12.4(b) the payback period
                      is three and a half years. This measure has the virtue of simplicity and is most often used
                      where the difficulty of forecasting is high and therefore risk is high. In such circumstances
                      this measure can be used to select projects or strategies that have the quickest payback.
                      Thus acceptable payback periods vary from industry to industry. A venture capitalist
                      investing in a high-technology start-up may expect a fast return, whereas public infra-
                      structure projects such as road building may be assessed over payback periods exceeding

   50 years. One problem with the basic payback period method is that it assumes that fore-
   cast cash flows are equally valuable in the future, however risky or distant: €100 predicted
   in three years’ time is given the same weight as €100 next year. Organisations therefore
   often use ‘discount’ methods to allow for greater uncertainty in the more distant future.

  cash-flow forecasting techniques which ‘discounts’ (gives less value to) earnings the further
  into the future they are. The resulting measure is the net present value (or NPV) of the project,
  one of the most widely used criteria for assessing the financial viability of a project. In principle,
  given limited resources, the project with the best NPV should be selected. However, a DCF is only
  as valid as the assumptions built into it, so it is important to test sensitivity to different evalu-
  ations and scenarios. Taking the example of DCF in 12.4(c), once the cash inflows and outflows
  have been assessed for each of the years of a strategic option they are discounted by an appro-
  priate cost of capital. This cost of capital is the ‘hurdle’ that projects must exceed. The discount
  rate reflects the fact that cash generated early is more valuable than cash generated later. The
  discount rate is also set at a level that reflects the riskiness of the strategy under consideration
  (i.e. a higher rate for greater risk). In the example, the cost of capital or discounting rate of
  10 per cent (after tax) reflects the rate of return required by those providing finance for the
  venture – shareholders and/or lenders. The 10 per cent cost of capital shown here includes an
  allowance for inflation of about 3–4 per cent. It is referred to as the ‘money cost of capital’.
  By contrast, the ‘real’ cost of capital is 6–7 per cent after allowing for or excluding inflation.
  The projected after-tax cash flow of £2m (€2.2m; $3m) at the start of year 2 is equivalent to
  receiving £1.82m now – £2m multiplied by 0.91 or 1/1.10. £1.82m is called the present value
  of receiving £2m at the start of year 2 at a cost of capital of 10 per cent. Similarly, the after-tax
  cash flow of £5m at the start of year 3 has a present value of £4.13m – £5m multiplied by 1/1.10
  squared. The net present value (NPV) of the venture, as a whole, is calculated by adding up all
  the annual present values over the venture’s anticipated life. In the example, this is seven years.
  The NPV works out at £8.78m. Allowing for the time value of money, the £8.78m is the extra
  value that the strategic initiative will generate during its entire lifetime. However, it would be
  sensible to undertake a sensitivity analysis, for example by assuming different levels of sales
  volume increases, or different costs of capital in order to establish what resulting NPV measures
  would be and at what point NPV falls below zero. For example, in Figure 12.3(c) a cost of capital
  or discounting rate of about 32 per cent would produce a zero NPV. Such sensitivity testing is,
  then, a way in which DCF can be used to assess risk.
• Shareholder value analysis (SVA) is a variation on DCF analysis in that it values the whole
  business rather than specific projects. It focuses on the creation of value for shareholders
  as measured by share price performance and flow of funds. The approach relies upon
  identifying the key ‘value drivers’ for value creation in the business such as sales growth,
  profit margin improvement, capital investment decisions, capital structure decisions, cost of
  capital, and their effect on future cash flow. It is calculated by dividing the estimated total
  net value of a company based on its present and future cash flows, by the value of its shares.

With regard to these four approaches to assessing returns, it is important to remember that
there are no absolute standards as to what constitutes a good or poor return. It will differ
between industries and countries and between different stakeholders, so that a higher return,
rather than a lower return, might be better for shareholders while for other stakeholders such as
employees, higher salaries might be preferred. So it is important to establish what return is seen
as acceptable by which stakeholders. There are also three further problems of financial analysis:

• The problem of uncertainty. Be wary of the apparent thoroughness of the various
  approaches to financial analysis. Most were developed for the purposes of investment
  appraisal. Therefore, they focus on discrete projects where the additional cash inflows and
  outflows can be predicted with relative certainty: for example, a retailer opening a new

                                                                                                   385
Chapter 12 Evaluating strategies


                       store has a good idea about likely turnover based on previous experience of similar stores
                       in similar areas. Such assumptions are not necessarily valid in many strategic contexts
                       because the outcomes are much less certain. It is as strategy implementation proceeds
                       (with the associated cash-flow consequences) that outcomes become clearer (see the
                       discussion of ‘real options’ below).
                    • The problem of specificity. Financial appraisals tend to focus on direct tangible costs and
                      benefits rather than the strategy more broadly. However, it is often not easy to identify
                      such costs and benefits, or the cash flows specific to a proposed strategy, since it may not
                      be possible to isolate them from other ongoing business activities. Moreover such costs
                      and benefits may have spillover effects. For example, a new product may look unprofitable
                      as a single project. But it may make strategic sense by enhancing the market acceptability
                      of other products in a company’s portfolio.
                    • Assumptions. Financial analysis is only as good as the assumptions built into the analysis.
                      If assumptions about sales levels or costs are misguided, for example, then the value of
                      the analysis is reduced, even misleading. This is one reason why sensitivity testing based
                      on variations of assumptions is important.

                    Real options14
                    Many of the previous approaches value strategic initiatives on a stand-alone basis. There are,
                    however, situations where the strategic benefits and opportunities only become clear as imple-
                    mentation proceeds. For example, a diversification strategy may develop in several steps: it may
                    take many years for the success of the initial diversification move to become clear and for possible
                    follow-up opportunities to emerge. In these circumstances the traditional DCF approach discussed
                    above will tend to undervalue an initial strategic move because it does not take into account the
                    value of options that could be opened up by the initiative going forward.15 In pharmaceuticals,
                    for example, many research projects fail to produce new drugs with the intended benefit. There
                    could, however, be other outcomes of value to a failed project: the research could create valuable
                    new knowledge or provide a ‘platform’ from which other products or process improvements
                    spring. So a strategy should be seen as a series of ‘real’ options. A ‘real’ option16 is the right, but
                    not the obligation, to undertake certain business initiatives. For instance it might include an
                    opportunity at a specific time to invest, expand or defer a capital investment project. Illustra-
                    tion 12.4 provides an example. A real options approach to evaluation therefore typically increases
                    the expected value of a project because it adds the expected value of possible future options
                    created by that project going forward. There are four main benefits of this approach:

                    • Bringing strategic and financial evaluation closer together. Arguably it provides a clearer
                      understanding of both strategic and financial return and risk of a strategy by examining
                      each step (option) separately.
                    • Valuing emerging options. In taking such an approach, it allows a value to be placed on
                      new options made available by the initial strategic decision. The value of the first step is
                      increased by the opportunities that it opens up.
                    • Coping with uncertainty. Advocates of a real options approach argue it provides an alter-
                      native to profitability analyses that requires managers to make assumptions about future
                      conditions that may well not be realistic. As such, it can be linked into ways of analysing
                      uncertain futures such as scenario analysis (Section 2.4). Applying a real options approach
                      encourages managers to defer irreversible decisions as far as possible because the passage
                      of time will clarify expected returns – even to the extent that apparently unfavourable
                      strategies might prove viable at a later date.
                    • Offsetting conservatism. One problem with financial analyses such as DCF is that high hurdle
                      or discount rates set to reflect risk and uncertainty mean that ambitious but uncertain

Chapter 12 Evaluating strategies


                       projects (and strategies) tend not to receive support. The real options approach, on the
                       other hand, tends to value higher more ambitious strategies. There have, therefore, been
                       calls to employ real options together with more traditional financial evaluation such as DCF.
                       In effect, DCF provides the cautionary view and real options the more optimistic view.

                       Note that a real options approach is more useful where a strategy can be structured in
                    the form of options – for example, where there are stages, as in pharmaceutical develop-
                    ment – such that each stage gives the possibility of abandoning or deferring going forward.
                    It would not give the same advantages of flexibility to a project where major capital outlay
                    was required at the beginning.



                    12.4.2 Risk
                    The second R is the risk an organisation faces in pursuing a strategy. Risk concerns the extent
                    to which strategic outcomes are unpredictable, especially with regard to possible nega-
                    tive outcomes. Risk is therefore linked with outcome, return, so that a higher risk is gener-
                    ally associated with the chances of a higher return and a lower risk with lower return – the
                    so-called ‘risk-return tradeoff’. The reason that higher risk is associated with higher return
                    is that more time and effort are generally needed to obtain information and to monitor
                    progress, than for lower risk investments. If an investment has a high risk and low return,
                    it is likely investors would seek to leave that investment for another, so driving up the level
                    of return. Similarly, for an investment with low risk and high return, more investors would
                    want to be involved, thus driving down the return. Risk can be high for organisations with
                    major long-term programmes of innovation, or where high levels of uncertainty exist about
                    key issues in the environment, or where there are high levels of public concern about new
                    developments – such as genetically modified crops.17 A key issue is to establish the accept-
                    able level of risk for the organisation. Is the organisation prepared to ‘bet the company’
                    on a single strategic initiative, risking total destruction, or does it prefer a more cautious
                    approach of maintaining several less unpredictable and lower-stakes initiatives? Formal risk
                    assessments are often incorporated into business plans as well as the investment appraisals
                    of major projects. Chosen strategies should be within the limits of acceptable risk for the
                    organisation. Young entrepreneurs may have a higher tolerance for risk than established
                    family businesses, for example. Importantly, risks other than ones with immediate financial
                    impact should be included, such as risk to corporate reputation or brand image. Developing a
                    good understanding of an organisation’s strategic position (Part I of this book) is at the core
                    of good risk assessment. However, the following tools can also be helpful in a risk assessment.


                    Sensitivity analysis18
                    Sometimes referred to as what-if analysis, sensitivity analysis allows each of the important
                    assumptions underlying a particular strategy to be questioned and challenged. In particular,
                    it tests how sensitive the predicted performance outcome (e.g. profit) is to each of these
                    assumptions. For example, the key assumptions underlying a strategy might be that market
                    demand will grow by 5 per cent a year, or that a new product will achieve a given sales level,
                    or that certain expensive machines will operate at 90 per cent loading. Sensitivity analysis
                    asks what would be the effect on performance (for example, profitability) of variations on
                    these assumptions. For example, if market demand grew at only 1 per cent, or by as much as
                    10 per cent, would either of these extremes alter the decision to pursue that strategy? This
                    can help develop a clearer picture of the risks of making particular strategic decisions and
                    the degree of confidence managers might have in a given decision. Illustration 12.5 shows
                    how sensitivity analysis can be used.

Sensitivity analysis is a useful technique for assessing the extent to which the success of
a preferred strategy is dependent on the key assumptions that underlie that strategy.

                    Financial risk19
                    Financial risk refers to the possibility that the organisation may not be able to meet the key
                    financial obligations necessary for survival. Managers need to ensure that strategies meet
                    acceptable levels of financial risk. Two key measures are important here.
                        First, there is the level of gearing, the amount of debt the company has relative to its
                    equity. Strategies that increase the gearing (or ‘leverage’) of a company also raise the level
                    of financial risk. This is because interest payments on debt are mandatory and inflexible: if
                    performance dips and the interest cannot be paid, the company risks bankruptcy.
                        A second kind of financial risk measure relates to an organisation’s liquidity. Liquidity
                    refers to the amount of liquid assets (typically cash) that is available to pay immediate bills.
                    Many businesses fail not because they are inherently unprofitable, but because of a lack of
                    liquid assets, whether their own or obtained through short-term loans. For example, a small
                    manufacturer with a rapid growth strategy may be tempted to take on lots of orders, but
                    then find that they have to pay their suppliers for the raw materials before they actually
                    receive the payments for the goods they have produced. Again, a company that cannot pay
                    its bills risks bankruptcy.

                    Break-even analysis
                    Break-even analysis20 is a simple and widely used approach which allows variations in
                    assumptions about key variables in a strategy to be examined. It demonstrates at what point
                    in terms of revenue the business will recover its fixed and variable costs and therefore break
                    even. It can therefore be used to assess the risks associated with different price and cost
                    structures of strategies as shown in Illustration 12.6.


                    12.4.3 Reaction of stakeholders
                    The third R is the likely reaction of stakeholders to a proposed strategy. Section 5.2.2 showed
                    how stakeholder mapping can be used to understand the political context and consider the
                    political agenda in an organisation. It also showed how stakeholder mapping can be used to
                    consider the likely reactions of stakeholders to new strategies and thus evaluate the accept-
                    ability of a strategy. There are many situations where stakeholder reactions could be crucial.
                    Chapter 5 covers a range of stakeholders but the following show how they may evaluate
                    strategy differently. For example:

                    • Owners (e.g. shareholders, including private individuals as well as investment funds,
                      venture capitalists, private equity, family owners, the state) will have financial expect-
                      ations to be met so that a proposed strategy that might reduce profitability or dilute their
                      voting power is likely to be unacceptable.
                    • Bankers and other providers of interest-bearing loans are concerned about the risk
                      attached to their loans and the competence with which this is managed. The extent to
                      which a proposed strategy could affect the capital structure of the company could be
                      a concern if, for instance, it would increase the gearing ratio (of debt to equity), which
                      indicates how sensitive the company’s solvency is to changes in its profit position. Similarly
                      a reduction in interest cover, that shows the extent to which profits can cover interest
                      payment, would be of concern to bankers as would be changes in a company’s liquidity,
                      as deterioration may mean the need for additional loans and a change in the company’s
                      risk profile. So a key question is: how will the proposed strategy affect liquidity?
                    • Government agencies and regulators are important stakeholders in industries such as
                      telecommunications, financial services, pharmaceuticals and power. They may have what

Chapter 12 Evaluating strategies


                       amounts to decision-making powers over aspects of an organisation’s strategy, such as
                       price or geographic expansion.
                    • Employees and unions and local community may resist strategic moves such as relocation,
                      outsourcing or divestment if they see them as likely to result in job losses. Matters of
                      business ethics and social responsibility were discussed in Section 5.4.
                    • Customers may also object to a strategy and switch their business to a competitor. For
                      example, a new business model, such as marketing online, might run the risk of a backlash
                      from existing retail channels, which could jeopardise the success of the strategy.

                       Overall, there is a need to be conscious of the impact on the various stakeholders of the
                    strategic options being considered. Managers also need to understand how the capability
                    to meet the varied expectations of stakeholders could enable the success of some strategies
                    while limiting the ability of an organisation to succeed with other strategies.



12.5 Feasibility
                    Feasibility is concerned with whether a strategy could work in practice: in other words,
                    whether an organisation has the capacity to deliver a strategy. An assessment of feasibility
                    is likely to involve two key questions: (a) do the resources and capabilities currently exist to
                    implement a strategy effectively? And (b) if not, can they be obtained? These questions can
                    be applied to any resource area that has a bearing on the viability of a proposed strategy.
                    Here, however, the focus is on three areas: finance, people (and their skills) and the import-
                    ance of resource integration.


                    12.5.1 Financial feasibility
                    A central issue in considering a proposed strategy is the funding required for it. It is therefore
                    important to forecast the cash flow21 implications of the strategy. The need is to identify the
                    cash required for a strategy, the cash generated by following the strategy and the timing
                    of any new funding requirements. This then informs consideration of the likely sources for
                    obtaining funds.
                       Managers need to be familiar with different sources of funds as well as the advantages
                    and drawbacks of these. This is well explained in standard financial texts.22 This is not only
                    a matter of the feasibility of a strategy, but also its acceptability to different stakeholders,
                    not least those providing the funds. So the discussion in Section 12.4 is relevant here too.
                    Decisions on which funding sources to use will also be influenced by the current financial
                    situation of the organisation such as ownership (e.g. whether the business is privately held or
                    publicly quoted) and by the overall corporate goals and strategic priorities of the organisa-
                    tion. For example, there will be different financial needs if a business is seeking rapid growth
                    by acquisition compared with if it is seeking to consolidate its past performance.
                       A useful way of considering funding is in terms of which financial strategies might be
                    needed for different ‘phases’ of the life cycle of a business (as opposed to an industry life
                    cycle). The following describe each life-cycle stage and funding implications:

                    • Start-up businesses23 are high-risk businesses. They are at the beginning of their life cycle
                      and are not yet established in their markets; moreover, they are likely to require substantial
                      investment. A stand-alone business in this situation might, for example, seek to finance
                      such growth from specialists in this kind of investment, such as venture capitalists who,
                      themselves, seek to offset risk by having a portfolio of such investments. Schemes for
                      private investors (so-called ‘business angels’) have also become popular. Providers of such

                                                                                       12.5 Feasibility


   funds are, however, likely to be demanding, given the high business risk. Thus venture
   capitalists or business angels typically require a high proportion of the equity ownership
   in exchange for even quite small injections of funds.
• Growth businesses may remain in a volatile and highly competitive market position.
  The degree of business risk may therefore remain high, as will the cost of capital in such
  circumstances. However, if a business in this phase has begun to establish itself in its
  markets, perhaps as a market leader in a growing market, then the cost of capital may be
  lower. In either case, since the main attractions to investors here are the product or busi-
  ness concept and the prospect of future earnings, equity capital is likely to be appropriate,
  perhaps by public flotation.
• Mature businesses are those operating in mature markets and the likelihood is that
  funding requirements will decline. If such a business has achieved a strong competi-
  tive position with a high market share, it should be generating regular and substantial
  surpluses. Here the business risk is lower and the opportunity for retained earnings is high.
  In these circumstances, if funding is required, it may make sense to raise this through debt
  capital as well as equity, since reliable returns can be used to service such debt. Provided
  increased debt (gearing or leverage) does not lead to an unacceptable level of risk, this
  cheaper debt funding will in fact increase the residual profits achieved by a company in
  these circumstances.
• Declining businesses are likely to find it difficult to attract equity finance. However,
  borrowing may be possible if secured against residual assets in the business. At this stage,
  it is likely that the emphasis in the business will be on cost cutting, and it could well be that
  the cash flows from such businesses are quite strong. Risk is medium, especially if decline
  looks to be gradual. However, there is the chance of sudden shake-out with battles for
  survival.

These life-cycle stages and funding implications are shown in Table 12.4.
   This life-cycle framework does not, however, always hold. For instance it is common for
companies to invest in new ventures, services, technologies to develop new and innovative
businesses in order to survive long term. Doing this on a regular basis might, in effect, be
acting as its own venture capitalist, accepting high risk at the business level and seeking to
offset such risk by ‘cash cows’ in its portfolio (see Section 8.7). Or some companies may need
to sell off businesses as they mature to raise capital for further investment in new ventures.
Public-sector managers know about the need to balance the financial risk of services too.
They need a steady core to their service where budgets are certain to be met, hence reducing
the financial risk of the more speculative aspects of their service.

Chapter 12 Evaluating strategies


                    12.5.2 People and skills
                    Chapter 4 showed how organisations that achieve sustainable competitive advantage may
                    do so on the basis of resources and capabilities that are embedded in the skills, knowledge
                    and experience of people in that organisation. Indeed, ultimately the success of a strategy will
                    likely depend on how it is delivered by people in the organisation. These could be managers
                    but they could also be more junior people in the organisation who are nonetheless critical
                    to a strategy, for example as the front-line contact with customers. Three questions arise: do
                    people in the organisation currently have the competences to deliver a proposed strategy?
                    Are the systems to support those people fit for the strategy? If not, can the competences be
                    obtained or developed?
                        The first step here is the same as suggested in Section 12.3.1 for the screening for compet-
                    itive advantage. The need is to identify the key resources and capabilities underpinning a
                    proposed strategy, but specifically in terms of the people and skills required. The second step
                    is to determine if these exist in the organisation. It could be, of course, that the proposed
                    strategy is built on the argument that they do. If so, how realistic is this? Or it could be that
                    the assumption is that these can be obtained or developed. Again, is this realistic?
                        Many of the issues of feasibility in relation to the structures and systems to support such
                    competence development and people are addressed in Chapter 14 on organising and
                    Chapter 15 on leading strategic change. Other critical questions that need to be considered
                    include:24

                    • Work organisation. Will changes in work content and priority-setting significantly alter
                      the orientation of people’s jobs? Will managers need to think differently about the tasks
                      that need to be done? What are the critical criteria for effectiveness needed? Are these
                      different from current requirements?
                    • Rewards. How will people need to be incentivised? Will people’s career aspirations be
                      affected? How will any significant shifts in power, influence and credibility need to be
                      rewarded and recognised?
                    • Relationships. Will interactions between key people need to change? What are the conse-
                      quences for the levels of trust, task competence and values-congruence? Will conflict and
                      political rivalry be likely?
                    • Training and development. Are current training and mentoring systems appropriate?
                      It may be necessary to take into account the balance between the need to ensure the
                      successful delivery of strategy in the short term and the required future development of
                      people’s capabilities.
                    • Recruitment and promotion. Given these issues, will new people need to be recruited into
                      the organisation, or can talent be promoted and supported from below?




12.6 Evaluation
                    Evaluation is concerned with identifying strategies that can pass all the hurdles of suit-
                    ability, acceptability and feasibility. This is an important stage in the selection process as
                    strategies that may appear excellent under one criteria may fail under another. To take into
                    account there may be conflicting conclusions, there needs to be a synthesis of the strategies

                                                                                  12.6 Evaluation


selected from the analysis of suitability, acceptability and feasibility, so that the chosen
strategy works for all. This often means that strategies that seemed superior earlier on in
the process at the suitability stage may either drop out or require significant adjustment
to continue. Often the chosen strategy is less about what is ‘best’, and more about what is
possible.


12.6.1 Three qualifications
There are three qualifications that need to be made about evaluation criteria:

• Management judgement. Conflicting conclusions can arise from the application of the
  criteria of suitability, acceptability and feasibility and it is therefore important to remember
  that the criteria discussed here are useful in helping think through strategic options but
  are not a replacement for management judgement. Managers faced with a strategy they
  see as suitable, but which key stakeholders object to, have to rely on their own judgement
  on the best course of action, but this should be better informed through the analysis and
  evaluation they have undertaken.
• Consistency between the different elements of a strategy. It should be clear from the chap-
  ters in Part II that there are several elements of a strategy, so an important question is
  whether the component parts work together as a ‘package’. So competitive strategy (such
  as low cost or differentiation), strategy direction (such as product development or diver-
  sification) and methods of pursuing strategies (such as organic development, acquisition
  or alliances) need to be considered as a whole and be consistent. There are dangers if
  they are not. For example, suppose an organisation wishes to develop a differentiation
  strategy by building on its capabilities developed over many years to develop new prod-
  ucts or services within a market it knows well. There may be dangers in looking to develop
  those new products through acquiring other businesses which might have very different
  capabilities that are incompatible with the strengths of the business.
• The implementation and development of strategies may throw up issues that might
  make organisations reconsider whether particular strategic options are, in fact, feasible
  or uncover factors that change views on the suitability or acceptability of a strategy. This
  may lead to a reshaping, or even abandoning, of strategic options. It therefore needs to be
  recognised that, in practice, strategy evaluation may take place through implementation,
  or at least partial implementation. This is another reason why experimentation, low-cost
  probes and real options evaluation may make sense.
• Strategy development in practice. More generally, it should not be assumed that the
  careful and systematic evaluation of strategy is necessarily the norm in organisations.
  Strategies may develop in other ways. This is the subject of Chapter 13 which follows. The
  final chapter, Chapter 16, also explains what managers actually do in managing strategic
  issues.

13.1 Introduction
          We are familiar with successful strategies: Google’s dominance of internet search; Ryanair
          becoming one of the most successful airlines in the world; Apple’s development of the
          iPhone and iPad; Zara’s internationalisation in the fashion market. We also know about failed
          strategies: Kodak in photography; the Royal Bank of Scotland in banking; Saab’s attempted
          internationalisation in automobiles. Much of Parts I and II of this book help us understand
          this. They addressed how strategists might understand the strategic position of their organ-
          isation and what strategic choices are sensible. However, none of this directly addresses the
          question that is the theme of this chapter: how do strategies actually develop? (Chapter 16
          then examines in more detail the people involved in these processes and what they actually
          do in developing strategies).
              According to one source, Steve Jobs’ strategy before Apple’s entry into the music player
          and smartphone businesses with the iPod, iTunes and later the iPhone and iPad was ‘to wait
          for the next big thing’.1 It was not, therefore, only based on brilliant foresight or a clear stra-
          tegic plan. The strategy rather developed over time in steps, some of which were designed
          and intentional, while some simply materialised over time.
              Figure 13.1 summarises the structure of this chapter. It is organised around two main views
          of strategy development: strategy as deliberate and strategy as emergent.2 The deliberate
          strategy development view is that strategies come about as the result of the conscious inten-
          tions of top management. It is related to the design view of strategy development explained
          in the commentary sections of this book. The second view is that of emergent strategy devel-
          opment; that strategies do not develop on the basis of a grand plan, but tend to emerge in
          organisations over time. The discussion in the Commentaries of the experience and variety
          lenses relates to this view. As the chapter will show, however, these two main views of how
          strategies develop are not mutually exclusive. As Figure 13.1 shows, they are both likely to
          influence the eventual strategy that actually comes about – the realised strategy.
              The next section (13.2) of the chapter discusses deliberate strategy development. First,
          there is an explanation of how strategies may be the outcome of leadership, ‘command’
          or vision of individuals. This is followed by a discussion of what formal planning systems in
          organisations might look like and the role they play. The section concludes by explaining how
          strategies might be deliberately imposed on organisations from the outside. Section 13.3

                   of the chapter then switches to views and explanations of how strategies might emerge in
                   organisations. The section offers three views of how this might occur: logical incrementalism,
                   the influence of political processes in organisations and finally how strategies could be the
                   outcome of organisational structures and systems. The final section of the chapter (13.4) raises
                   implications for managing strategy development including:

                   • How different approaches to strategy development may be more or less well suited to
                     different contexts.
                   • Some of the challenges that arise from managing the processes of deliberate and emer-
                     gent strategy.




13.2 Deliberate strategy development
                   Deliberate strategy involves intentional formulation or planning. Such intentionality may
                   take different forms. It could be the intentionality of a strategic leader, for example a CEO
                   or the founder of a firm. It could be through a process of strategic planning involving many
                   managers. Or it might be experienced as the external imposition of strategy formulated
                   elsewhere.


                   13.2.1 The role of the strategic leader
                   An organisation’s strategy may be influenced by strategic leaders: individuals or manage-
                   ment teams of individuals whose personalities, positions or reputations make them central
                   to the strategy development process. This could be because she or he is the entrepreneur
                   behind the organisation. This is often the case in small businesses and family businesses, but
                   may also persist when a business becomes very large.3 Such is the case with Richard Branson
                   at Virgin or Mark Zuckerberg at Facebook. Or it could be that an individual chief executive
                   has played a central role in directing the strategy of an organisation, as with Ratan Tata of the
                   Tata Corporation or Michael O’Leary at Ryanair. Research has shown that founder CEOs and
                   CEOs recruited to a firm typically make different contributions to strategic success, at least
                   in terms of market expansion. Founders are more successful at achieving rapid growth in
                   nascent, fast-growing markets, often by applying what they have learned from their previous
                   experience. CEOs that are recruited need more time to build their knowledge and influence
                   but tend to be more successful in complex market conditions.4
                      Illustration 13.1 provides examples of how strategic leaders have influenced different
                   aspects of strategy in their organisations.
                      Strategy, then, may be – or may be seen to be – the deliberate intention of a strategic
                   leader. This may manifest itself in different ways:

                   • Strategic leadership as command. The strategy of an organisation might be dictated by an
                     individual. This is, perhaps, most evident in single owner-managed small firms, where that
                     individual is in direct control of all aspects of the business. Canadian scholars Danny Miller
                     and Isabel Le Breton-Miller5 suggest there are advantages and disadvantages here. On
                     the plus side it can mean speed of strategy adaptation and ‘sharp, innovative, unorthodox
                     strategies that are difficult for other companies to imitate’. The downside can, however,
                     be ‘hubris, excessive risk taking, quirky, [or] irrelevant strategies’.
                   • Strategic leadership as vision. It could be that a strategic leader determines or is associated
                     with an overall vision, mission, or strategic intent (see Section 1.2) that motivates others,
                     helps create the shared beliefs within which people can work together effectively and

Chapter 13 Strategy development processes


                      guides the more detailed strategy developed by others in an organisation. James Collins
                      and Jerry Porras’s study6 of US firms with long-term high performance concluded that this
                      is a centrally important role of the strategic leader. For example, Ingvar Kamprad, IKEA’s
                      founder’s, vision, ‘To create a better everyday life for the many’, has motivated and guided
                      subsequent generations of IKEA managers and staff.
                   • Strategic leadership as decision making. Whichever strategy development processes
                     exist, there could be many different views on future strategy within an organisation and,
                     perhaps, much, but incomplete evidence to support those views. One of the key roles of
                     leaders is to have the ability to weigh such different views, interpret data, have the confi-
                     dence to take timely decisions to invest in key resources or markets and the authority to
                     get others to buy in to those decisions.
                   • Strategic leadership as the embodiment of strategy. A founder or chief executive of an
                     organisation may represent its strategy. This may be unintentional but can also be delib-
                     erate: for example, Richard Branson no longer runs Virgin on a day-to-day basis, but he
                     is seen as the embodiment of the Virgin strategy and is frequently the public face of the
                     company.



                   13.2.2 Strategic planning systems
                   A second way in which intended strategies develop is through formalised strategic plan-
                   ning: systematic analysis and exploration to develop an organisation’s strategy. Larger
                   organisations and corporations often have quite elaborate strategic planning systems. In a
                   study of such systems in major oil companies, Rob Grant7 of Bocconi University noted the
                   following stages in the planning cycle:

                   • Initial guidelines. The cycle’s starting point is usually a set of guidelines or assumptions
                     about the external environment (e.g. price levels and supply and demand conditions) and
                     the overall priorities, guidelines and expectations of the corporate centre.
                   • Business-level planning. In the light of these guidelines, business units or divisions draw
                     up strategic plans to present to the corporate centre. Corporate centre executives then
                     discuss those plans with the business managers, usually in face-to-face meetings. On the
                     basis of these discussions the businesses revise their plans for further discussion.
                   • Corporate-level planning. The corporate plan results from the aggregation of the business
                     plans. This coordination may be undertaken by a corporate planning department that, in
                     effect, has a coordination role. The corporate board then has to approve the corporate plan.
                   • Financial and strategic targets are then likely to be extracted to provide a basis for perform-
                     ance monitoring of businesses and key strategic priorities on the basis of the plan.

                   Grant found that some of the companies he studied were much more formal and system-
                   atised than others (e.g. the French Elf Aquitaine and Italian ENI), with greater reliance on
                   written reports and formal presentations, more fixed planning cycles, less flexibility and
                   more specific objectives and targets relating to the formal plans. Where there was more
                   informality or flexibility (e.g. BP, Texaco and Exxon), companies placed greater emphasis on
                   more general financial targets. Central corporate planning departments also played different
                   roles. In some organisations they acted primarily as coordinators of business plans. In others
                   they were more like internal consultants, helping business unit managers to formulate their
                   plans. Illustration 13.2 is a schematic representation of how strategic planning takes place
                   in Siemens, the multinational industrial engineering company.
                      While larger organisations often have comprehensive strategic planning systems, smaller
                   ones also use strategic planning. A prerequisite for entrepreneurial start-ups that need initial

                   external funding is often to present a detailed strategic business plan. Planning horizons and
                   associated objectives and bases of analysis vary depending on industry and environment
                   conditions. In a complex environment that involves new and emerging technologies, regu-
                   lations and customer preferences and changing industry borders a new venture may only
                   be able to plan a year ahead. In a fast-moving consumer goods company three- to five-year
                   plans may be appropriate. In companies which have to take very long-term views on capital
                   investment, such as those in the oil industry, planning horizons can be as long as 15 years (in
                   Exxon) or 20 years (in Shell).
                      Strategic planning may play several roles and typically four are emphasised:

                   • Formulating strategy by providing means by which managers can understand strategic
                     issues, for example competitive positions (see Chapter 3) and distinctive capabilities (see
                     Chapter 4). Formulation contributes by establishing overall objectives (Chapter 1), encour-
                     aging the use of analytic tools such as those explained in this book and by encouraging a
                     longer-term view of strategy than might otherwise occur.
                   • Learning. Managers can benefit from planning if they see it as a means of learning rather
                     than a means of ‘getting the right answers’. Rita McGrath and Ian MacMillan emphasise
                     ‘discovery-driven’ planning which focuses on the need for questioning and challenging
                     received wisdom and the taken for granted.8
                   • Integration. Strategic planning systems may have the explicit purpose of coordinating
                     business-level strategies within an overall corporate strategy. They can also provide a
                     valuable forum for negotiation and compromise and, thus, the reconciliation of different
                     views on future strategy.9
                   • Communicating intended strategy throughout an organisation and providing clarity on
                     the purpose and objectives of a strategy or strategic milestones against which perform-
                     ance and progress can be reviewed. Communicating strategy is also a very first step
                     towards strategy implementation.

                       However, it should be recognised that strategic planning and planning systems may
                   also play other roles. If people are encouraged to be involved in planning processes it can
                   help to create shared ownership of the strategy and thus improve employee understanding
                   and commitment required for implementation.10 It may also provide a forum for middle
                   managers to influence strategic issues beyond their operational responsibilities.11 Strategic
                   planning can also provide a sense of security and logic, not least among senior management
                   who believe they should be seen to be proactively determining the future strategy and exer-
                   cising control over the destiny of their organisation.
                       Henry Mintzberg has, however, challenged the extent to which planning provides such
                   benefits.12 Arguably there are five main dangers in the way in which formal systems of stra-
                   tegic planning have been employed:

                   • Confusing planning with managing strategy. Managers may see themselves as managing
                     strategy when what they are doing is going through the processes of planning. Strategy
                     is, of course, not the same as ‘the plan’: strategy is the long-term direction that the organ-
                     isation follows – the realised strategy in Figure 13.1 – not just a written document. Linked
                     to this may be confusion between budgetary resource allocation processes and strategic
                     planning processes.13 The two may come to be seen as the same so that strategic planning
                     gets reduced to resource allocation and financial forecasting rather than thinking through
                     the sort of issues discussed in this book.
                   • Detachment from reality. The managers responsible for the implementation of strategies,
                     usually line managers, may be so busy with the day-to-day operations of the business that
                     they cede responsibility for strategic issues to specialists or consultants. However, these

  rarely have power in the organisation to make things happen. The result can be that
  strategic planning becomes removed from the reality of operations and the experience
  and knowledge of operating managers. If formal planning systems are to be useful, those
  responsible for them need to draw on such experience and involve people throughout the
  organisation. In the absence of such involvement there is the danger that the resulting
  strategy is not owned widely in the organisation.
• Paralysis by analysis. Ann Langley14 of HEC Montreal showed that planning can get bogged
  down in the interminable exchange of analytically based reports between different parties
  who do not agree or do not prioritise the same issues. Strategic planning can also become
  over-detailed in its approach, concentrating on extensive analysis that, while technically
  sound, misses the major strategic issues facing the organisation. It is not unusual to find
  companies with huge amounts of information on their markets, but with little clarity
  about the strategic importance of that information. The result can be information over-
  load with no clear outcome.
• Over-complex planning processes. There is a danger that the strategic planning process
  is so bureaucratic that it takes too long or, because individuals or groups contribute
  to only part of it, they do not understand the whole picture. The result can be that
  the realised strategy at one level, for example the business level, does not correspond
  to the intended corporate-level strategy. This is particularly problematic in large
  multi-business firms.
• Dampening of innovation. Highly formalised and rigid systems of planning, especially if
  linked to very tight and detailed mechanisms of control, can contribute to an inflexible,
  hierarchical organisation with a resultant stifling of ideas and dampening of innovative
  capacity. This is a reason why new venture units are sometimes set up in larger firms, which
  do not have to follow their formalised planning systems (see Section 10.5.2).

   Strategic planning has continuously been ranked first or second in a survey of manage-
ment tools used in organisations conducted by Bain,15 the management consultancy. The
evidence of strategic planning resulting in organisations performing better than others is
equivocal, however16 – not least because it is difficult to isolate formal planning as the deter-
mining effect on performance. Nevertheless, there is some evidence that planning may be
beneficial if it is designed to work in conjunction with bottom-up emergent processes of
strategy development – a process that may be thought of as the ‘planned emergence’ of
strategy.17
   While strategic planning remains common, there has been a decline in formal corporate
planning departments and a shift to business unit managers taking responsibility for
strategy development and planning (see Chapter 16). There has also been an increased
use of chief strategy officers taking on various strategy development roles, for example as
strategy formulation facilitators and as assisting in strategy implementation and execu-
tion (see Section 16.2).18 Another trend is strategic planning becoming less a vehicle for
top-down development of intended strategy and more of a vehicle for the coordination
of strategy emerging from below. This includes an increased openness and transparency
in strategy development involving more collaborative planning exercises and strategic
dialogues. Various social-strategy tools are being tried for this, such as crowdsourcing
strategy.19 For example, the Indian IT services and software development firm HCL Technol-
ogies transformed its business planning process from including a few hundred executives
into an online platform open to thousands of people. This development suggests that
strategic planning practices increasingly are acknowledging emergent strategy develop-
ment (see Section 13.3). Related to this is the recent concept ‘open strategy’, discussed in
Section 16.2.5.

                   13.2.3 Externally imposed strategy
                   Managers may face what they see as the imposition of strategy by powerful external stake-
                   holders. For example, government may dictate a particular strategic direction as in the
                   public sector, or where it exercises extensive regulatory powers in an industry. In the UK
                   public sector direct intervention has been employed for schools or hospitals deemed to be
                   under-performing badly, with specialist managers being sent in to turn round the ailing
                   organisations and impose a new strategic direction.
                      Businesses in the private sector may also be subject to imposed strategic direction, or
                   significant constraints on their choices. A multinational corporation seeking to develop busi-
                   nesses in some parts of the world may be subject to governmental requirements to do this in
                   certain ways, perhaps through joint ventures or local alliances. An operating business within
                   a multidivisional organisation may also perceive the overall corporate strategic direction of its
                   parent as akin to imposed strategy. For publicly listed companies financial markets also exer-
                   cise an influence over strategy, not least through so-called ‘activists’ that take an equity stake
                   in a corporation and put public pressure on its management. For example, Sweden's activist
                   investor Cevian Capital, invested in the German conglomerate Thyssenkrupp to become the
                   group's second largest shareholder. Together with other shareholders they have since pushed
                   for CEO and board to spin off Thyssenkrupp’s elevators, car parts and plant engineering divi-
                   sions to improve performance and boost shareholder returns. Venture capitalists and private
                   equity firms may also impose strategies on the businesses they acquire.20 When Michael Dell,
                   together with private equity firm Silver Lake Management, acquired Dell and delisted the
                   company’s share from NASDAQ a major objective was to take full control over strategy devel-
                   opment from current management and remove pressures from the financial market.



13.3 Emergent strategy development
                   Although strategy development is often described as though it is the deliberate intention of
                   top management, an alternative explanation is that of emergent strategy: that strategies
                   emerge on the basis of a series of decisions, which forms a pattern that becomes clear
                   over time. This explains an organisation’s strategy, not as a ‘grand plan’, but as a developing
                   ‘pattern in a stream of decisions’21 where top managers draw together emerging themes
                   of strategy from various decisions and directions, rather than formulating it directly from
                   the top. The pattern that emerges may then subsequently be more formally described, for
                   example in annual reports and strategic plans, and be seen as the deliberate strategy of the
                   organisation. It will not, however, have been the plan that developed the strategy; it will be
                   the emerging strategy that informed the plan. Emergent strategy may, then, be seen as a
                   basis for learning what works in search for a viable pattern or consistent strategy.
                      There are different views of emergent strategy22 and this section summarises the main
                   ones. They are: logical incrementalism, strategy as the outcome of political processes and,
                   as the outcome of organisational structure and systems. All three emphasise that strategy
                   development is not necessarily the province of top management alone, but may be more
                   devolved within organisations. Figure 13.2 shows how the different views can be thought of
                   in terms of a continuum according to how deliberately managed the processes are.


                   13.3.1 Logical incrementalism
                   The first explanation of how strategies may emerge is that of logical incrementalism.
                   This explanation, in effect, bridges deliberate and emergent processes, as it explains how

management may deliberately cultivate a bottom-up, experimental basis for strategies to
emerge. Logical incrementalism was a term coined by James Quinn in his study of how
strategies developed in multinational businesses. It is the development of strategy by
experimentation and learning ‘from partial commitments rather than through global
formulations of total strategies’.23 There are three main characteristics of strategy devel-
opment in this way:

• Environmental uncertainty. Managers realise that they cannot do away with the uncer-
  tainty of their environment by relying on analyses of historical data or predicting how
  it will change. Rather, they try to be sensitive to environmental signals by encouraging
  constant environmental scanning throughout the organisation.
• General goals. There may be a reluctance to specify precise objectives too early, as this
  might stifle ideas and prevent innovation and experimentation. So more general rather
  than specific goals may be preferred, with managers trying to move towards them
  incrementally.
• Experimentation.24 Managers seek to develop a strong, secure, but flexible, core business.
  They then build on the experience gained in that business to inform decisions both about
  its development and experimentation with ‘side-bet’ ventures. Commitment to strategic
  options may therefore be tentative in the early stages of strategy development. Such
  experiments are not the sole responsibility of top management and can thus be auton-
  omous. They emerge from what Quinn describes as ‘subsystems’ in the organisation –
  groups of people involved in, for example, product development, product positioning,
  diversification, external relations and so on. Employees can thus take strategic initiatives
  and form entrepreneurial ventures from the bottom up with important influence on
  strategy development.25 Organisations can also encourage this type of experimentation
  in different ways (see Section 10.5.2).

   Quinn argued that, despite its emergent nature, logical incrementalism can be ‘a
conscious, purposeful, proactive, executive practice’ to improve information available for
decisions and build people’s psychological identification with the development of strategy.
Logical incrementalism therefore suggests that strategy development can be deliberate,
while relying on organisational subsystems to sense what is happening in the environment
and to try out ideas through experimentation. It is a view of strategy development similar to
the descriptions that managers themselves often give of how strategies come about in their
organisations as Illustration 13.3 shows.

   Arguably, developing strategies in such a way has considerable benefits. Continual
testing and gradual strategy implementation provide improved quality of information for
decision making and enable the better sequencing of the elements of major decisions. Since
change will be gradual, the possibility of creating and developing a commitment to change
throughout the organisation is increased. Because the different parts, or ‘subsystems’, of the
organisation are in a continual state of interplay, the managers of each can learn from each
other about the feasibility of a course of action. Such processes also take account of the political
nature of organisational life, since smaller changes are less likely to face the same degree of
resistance as major changes. Moreover, the formulation of strategy in this way means that the
implications of the strategy are continually being tested out. This continual readjustment makes
sense if the environment is considered as a continually changing influence on the organisation.
   Given logical incrementalism’s emphasis on learning, it is a view of strategy development
which corresponds to the ‘learning organisation’26 – an organisation that is capable of
continual regeneration from the variety of knowledge, experience and skills within a
culture that encourages questioning and challenge. Proponents of the learning organisa-
tion argue that formal structures and systems of organisations typically stifle organisational
knowledge and creativity. They argue that the aim of top management should be to facilitate
rather than direct strategy development by building pluralistic organisations, where ideas
bubble up from below, conflicting ideas and views are surfaced and become the basis of
debate; where knowledge is readily shared and experimentation is the norm such that ideas
are tried out in action. The emphasis is not so much on hierarchies as on different interest
groups that need to cooperate and learn from each other. In many respects there are simi-
larities here to implications of the variety lens discussed in the Commentaries.


13.3.2 Strategy as the outcome of political processes
A second explanation of how strategies may emerge is that they are the outcome of the
bargaining and power politics that go on between executives or between coalitions within an
organisation and its major stakeholders. Managers may well have different views on issues and
how they should be addressed; they are therefore likely to seek to position themselves such that
their views prevail. They may also seek to pursue strategies or control resources to enhance their
political status. The political view of strategy development is, then, that strategies develop
as the outcome of bargaining and negotiation among powerful interest groups (or stake-
holders).27 This is the world of boardroom battles often portrayed in film and TV dramas.
   A political perspective on strategic management suggests that the rational and analytic
processes often associated with developing strategy (see Section 13.2.2 above and the
design lens in the Commentary) may not be as objective and dispassionate as they appear.
Objectives may reflect the ambitions of powerful people. Information used in strategic
debate is not always politically neutral. A manager or coalition may exercise power over
another because they control important sources of information. Powerful individuals and
groups may also strongly influence which issues get prioritised. In such circumstances it is
bargaining and negotiation that give rise to strategy rather than careful analysis and delib-
erate intent. Indeed strategic planning processes, themselves, may provide an arena within
which managers form coalitions to gain influence.
   None of this should be surprising. In approaching strategic problems, people are likely to
be differently influenced by at least:

• Position and personal experience from their roles within the organisation.
• Competition for resources and influence between the different subsystems in the organ-
  isation and people within them who are likely to be interested in preserving or enhancing
  their positions.28


                                                                                                415
Chapter 13 Strategy development processes


                   • The relative influence of stakeholders on different parts of the organisation. For example,
                     a finance department may be especially sensitive to the influence of financial institutions
                     while a sales or marketing department will be strongly influenced by customers.
                   • Different access to information given their roles and functional affiliations.

                   In such circumstances there are two reasons to expect strategy development to build
                   gradually on the current strategy. First, if different views prevail and different parties
                   exercise their political muscle, compromise may be inevitable. Second, it is quite possible
                   that it is from the pursuit of the current strategy that power has been gained by those
                   wielding it. Indeed it may be very threatening to their power if significant changes in
                   strategy were to occur. It is likely that a search for a compromise solution accommodating
                   different power bases will end up with a strategy which is an adaptation of what has
                   gone before.
                      There are, however, more positive ways of seeing political processes. The conflict and
                   tensions that manifest themselves in political activity, arising as they do from different expect-
                   ations or interests, can be the source of new ideas29 (see the discussion on the variety lens
                   in the Commentaries) or challenge old ways of doing things. New ideas may be supported
                   or opposed by different ‘champions’ who will battle over what is the best idea or the best
                   way forward. Arguably, if such conflict and tensions did not exist, neither would innovation.
                   Further, as Section 15.5 shows, the exercise of power may be important in the management
                   of strategic change.


                   13.3.3 Strategy as the result of organisational structures
                   and systems
                   A third view of how strategies may emerge is on the basis of an organisation’s structure and
                   systems. Rather than seeing strategy development as about foresight and anticipation taking
                   form in directive plans from the top of the organisation, strategy development can be seen
                   as the outcome of managers, often at lower levels in large organisations, making sense of
                   and dealing with problems and opportunities by applying established ways of doing things.
                   There are echoes here of logical incrementalism, but there is less emphasis on deliberate
                   experimentation. The emphasis is rather on the influence of the structures, systems and
                   routines with which managers are familiar and which guide and constrain their decisions.
                   There are different explanations to consider here. First, strategy may be steered by managers’
                   attention to their specific contexts and how resources are allocated. Second, prior strategic
                   decisions may guide later strategies and, third, culture may influence strategy. Each one of
                   these explanations is discussed below.
                      The way resources are allocated may direct strategy development and there are two views
                   of how this may happen: the resource allocation process30 (RAP) view of strategy develop-
                   ment and the attention-based view31 (ABV) of strategy development. Both support the argu-
                   ment advanced by Harvard’s Joe Bower and Clark Gilbert that: ‘The cumulative impact of the
                   allocation of resources by managers at any level has more real-world effect on strategy than
                   any plans developed at headquarters.’32 Managers’ attention, including both the way they
                   make sense of the environment and the solutions they identify, is determined by each organ-
                   isational level’s specific context and situation. Hence, structures and systems at different
                   organisational levels form solutions like resource allocation decisions, which then shapes
                   strategy. Smaller resource allocation decisions at any level can then trigger a sequence of
                   increasingly important ones that in the end determines overall strategic outcomes.33 There
                   are thus two main arguments underlying this view of strategy development, shown graph-
                   ically in Figure 13.3:

         Solutions




                    • Organisational systems as a basis for making sense of issues. Managers are likely to make
                      sense of issues they face on the basis of the systems and routines with which they are
                      familiar and which directly affect them. For example, a finance director will be primarily
                      concerned with the financial systems of the organisation or an operations director with
                      operations. Managers within a business unit will be primarily concerned with the systems
                      relating to that business; managers at the corporate level with systems at that level.
                      Targets set by government for those managing public services can result in a focus on
                      some issues at the expense of others.

                          Vertical reporting relationships in hierarchies will focus managers’ attention on issues
                          within their part of the organisation as distinct from cooperating on wider issues across
                          the wider organisation. Managers in a business unit, close to a market, may pay attention
                          to routines and systems to do with competitors and customers whereas senior corporate
                          executives may be concerned with balancing resource allocation across businesses, with
                          systems relating to financial markets and with government regulation.

                             Whereas top-down explanations of deliberate strategy development assume that
                          managers’ focus of attention will readily cohere around clearly identified overarching
                          ‘strategic issues’ for the whole organisation, this explanation emphasises that: (i) it
                          may not be analysis of an organisation’s overall strategic position so much as local
                          systems that surface issues that get attended to; and (ii) such issues are likely to be
                          locally defined.
                    • Organisational systems provide bases of solutions to strategic issues. Systems and routines
                      also provide solutions that managers can draw on when faced with problems. However,
                      responses may differ depending on the context the managers are in and the associated
                      systems and routines. A common example is the way in which different responses emerge
                      as a result of a downturn in company performance. Marketing managers, seeing this as


                                                                                                               417
Chapter 13 Strategy development processes


                      a downturn in the market, may originate solutions that are to do with sales promotion
                      and advertising to generate more sales; research and development managers may see it
                      as a need for product innovation and accountants may see it as a need for tighter controls
                      and cost cutting. Each is drawing on the context in which they find themselves and the
                      associated systems and routines for dealing with such problems.

                      Another explanation of how strategies may emerge on the basis of structures and systems
                   concentrates on how these may be set up for one strategy, but then also guide later strat-
                   egies. Strategies may thus emerge based on prior strategic decisions and related structures
                   and systems that inform or constrain further strategy development. This strategy develop-
                   ment can be expected if a strategy is successful, as managers seek to maintain a continuity of
                   strategy in a series of strategic moves, each of which makes sense in terms of previous moves.
                   Figure 13.4 illustrates this. A business may start with a new product idea and the initial
                   success may give rise to further market investments and product extensions. Investment
                   in resources and systems to support and develop the growing business might follow. Over
                   time the company may then launch the product into new markets and perhaps seek to diver-
                   sify into related products. Each strategic move is informed by the rationale of the previous
                   one, such that over time the overall strategy becomes more and more established. However,
                   sometimes this can result in a suboptimal path dependency if the early decisions establish
                   ‘policy paths’ that have lasting effects on subsequent decisions as explained in Section 6.2.
                   Hence, even if the opening move (in this case a product launch) is not especially successful
                   the company may still continue to pursue the strategy that reinforces further sub-optimal
                   strategic decisions; just ‘digging the hole deeper’.
                      Besides the influence from resource allocation and prior strategic decisions strategy devel-
                   opment can also be shaped by organisational culture and related structures and systems.
                   Strategies may develop as an outcome and continuation of organisational culture including
                   people’s taken-for-granted assumptions, routines and behaviours in organisations even

          though they may be sub-optimal. Organisational culture works to define, or at least guide,
          how people view their organisation and its environment. It also tends to constrain what is
          seen as appropriate behaviour and activity. It is very likely, then, that decisions about future
          strategy will be within the bounds of the culture and that a pattern of continuity will be
          the outcome, subsequently post-rationalised by managers. Examples of this are given in
          Chapter 6, together with the potential problems that can arise. Not least among these is that
          such culturally bounded strategy development can lead to strategic drift (see Section 6.4).
             The influence from organisational structures and systems on strategy development
          does not of course exclude other views and explanations. For example, it helps explain why
          strategy development is likely to be a political process (Section 13.3.2) since it recognises
          that there will be different perceptions of strategic issues and different views on solutions.
          The emphasis on structures and systems does, however, de-emphasise top-down strategic
          planning and suggests it is an accumulation of local decisions strongly influenced by local
          context that accounts for strategy development.



13.4 Implications for managing strategy development
          It should be clear from the different views and explanations of strategy development
          processes that they are not discrete or mutually exclusive: multiple processes are likely to
          be evident.34 For example, planning systems exist in most large organisations, but there
          will also undoubtedly be political activity; indeed the planning system itself may be used
          for negotiating purposes. There will also be established structures, systems and procedures
          that will affect future decisions. As was explained at the beginning of the chapter, then,
          the strategy of an organisation is likely to develop in both deliberate and emergent ways.
          Illustration 13.4 describes what has become a classic case of strategy development in both
          research and teaching; two descriptions of how Honda became incredibly successful when
          entering the motorcycle market in the USA.35
              It is also likely that processes of strategy development will be seen differently by
          different people. For example, senior executives tend to see strategy development in
          terms of deliberate, rational, analytic planned processes, whereas middle managers see
          strategy development more as the result of political and cultural processes. Managers
          in public-sector organisations tend to see strategy as externally imposed more than
          managers in commercial businesses, largely because their organisations are answerable
          to government bodies.36 People who work in family businesses tend to see more evidence
          of the influence of powerful individuals, who may be the owners of the businesses.

          13.4.1 Strategy development in different contexts
          While there is no one right way in which strategies are developed, it is helpful if managers
          recognise the potential benefits and pitfalls of different processes of strategy development.
          Organisations differ in their size, form and complexity. They also face different environments,
          so different processes for managing strategy may make sense in different circumstances (see
          also Thinking Differently at the end of this chapter). Figure 13.5 provides a way of considering
          this by showing how organisations may possibly seek to cope with conditions that are on
          the one hand more or less static or dynamic and on the other hand more or less simple or
          complex:37

          • In simple/static conditions, the environment is relatively straightforward to understand
            and is not undergoing significant change. The organisation itself is also not overly

Illustration 13.4   A classic case: Honda entering the
US motorcycle market
There are different explanations of successful strategy development.

In 1984, Richard Pascale published a paper that described          of the 250cc and 305cc machines. The shape of the
the success Honda had experienced with the launch of its           handlebar on these larger machines looked like the
motorcycles in the US market in the 1960s. It is a paper that      eyebrow of Buddha, which he felt was a strong selling
has generated discussions about strategy development               point. . . We configured our start-up inventory with 25
processes ever since. First he gave explanations provided by       per cent of each of our four products – the 50cc Supercub
the Boston Consulting Group (BCG):                                 and the 125cc, 250cc and 305cc machines. In dollar value
                                                                   terms, of course, the inventory was heavily weighted

                                                                   towards the larger bikes. . . We were entirely in the

  complex; for example, it may be operating in a single market or with a narrow portfolio.
  Raw materials suppliers and some mass-manufacturing companies are examples. In such
  circumstances, if environmental change does occur, it may be predictable, so it could
  make sense to analyse the environment extensively on an historical basis as a means of
  trying to forecast likely future conditions. In situations of relatively low complexity, it may
  also be possible to identify some predictors of environmental influences. For example, in
  public services, demographic data such as birth rates might be used as lead indicators to
  determine the required provision of schooling, healthcare or social services. So in simple/
  static conditions systematic strategic planning is possible, perhaps with central planners
  taking the lead. It is also likely that past experience and prior decisions will be a significant
  influence since little is changing. The potential problem is, of course, that conditions do
  change; for example, the environment may become more dynamic and the established
  processes may not be suited to such conditions.
• In dynamic conditions, managers need to consider the environment of the future, not just
  of the past. The degree of uncertainty therefore increases. They may employ structured
  ways of making sense of the future, such as scenario planning, discussed in Section 2.4,
  or they may rely more on encouraging active sensing of environmental changes lower
  down in the organisation where people are operating closer to the changes that are
  taking place, for example in the market or in technology. Organisations seek to do this
  in various ways. For example, through strategy workshops and more open strategy
  making involving much wider participation in strategy development (see Sections 16.2.5
  and 16.4.1). Alternatively, organisations may seek to create conditions that encourage
  individuals and groups to be sensitive to signals from the changing environment, use
  forward thinking and challenging, similar to logical incrementalism and organisational
  learning (Section 13.3.1).
• Organisations in complex situations face an environment that is difficult to comprehend.
  For example, a multinational firm, or a major public service such as a local government
  authority with many services, is complex because of its diversity. In such circumstances
  such organisations may seek structural solutions; for example, they may subdivide their
  organisation into units where managers have particular expertise and have responsibility
  for strategic decision making within those units (see Section 14.2.2). Such organisations

                      may, of course, also face dynamic conditions and therefore a combination of complexity
                      and uncertainty. With more and more sophisticated technologies and increased compe-
                      tition, there is an increasing move towards this condition of greatest uncertainty. In such
                      circumstances it is simply not feasible for top management to understand all the influ-
                      ences on future strategy so there will be an even greater need to devolve strategy thinking
                      and influence within the organisation. There are various ways of doing this, including the
                      development of a portfolio of real options, corporate venturing and intrapreneurship (see
                      Section 10.5.2 and 12.4.1).

                     Considering the ways in which strategy may be developed in different contexts in turn
                   has a number of implications:

                   • The top management role in strategy development. Do top managers see themselves as
                     the detailed planners of strategy throughout the organisation; as the ones who set broad
                     strategic direction and cultivate managers below them who can develop more detailed
                     strategies; or as developing their own capabilities to detect and build upon strategies and
                     strategic ideas as they emerge from within the rest of the organisation?
                   • The roles of strategic planning. Strategic planning has different roles to play. The simpler the
                     conditions faced by the organisation, the more it may be possible for planning to direct the
                     strategy. The more the strategy development is devolved, however, the more there is likely
                     to be the problem of the coordination of an overall strategy for an organisation. In such
                     circumstances strategic planning may also play a role but as a coordinating and communi-
                     cation mechanism. This may be useful because it may be important that there is a formal
                     explanation of the strategy for the stakeholders of the organisation. The danger, however,
                     is that planning does little more than pull together ‘received wisdom’ such that it merely
                     post-rationalises where the organisation has come from. If strategic planning systems are
                     to be useful it is, then, important that they encourage the challenge of received wisdom
                     and ways of doing things.
                   • Different strategy development roles at different organisational levels. A study of corporate
                     parents’ relationship to their business units or subsidiaries found that there were distinct
                     differences in the strategy development approaches and roles at these different levels.38
                     The business units/subsidiaries were playing the experimental role. Highly reliant on
                     informal contacts with their markets, managers’ decisions were made largely on the basis
                     of their experience. The executives at the centre were more concerned with the search for
                     order throughout the business and therefore on planning, building on existing resources
                     and refining existing strategy. This study makes the point that managers at different
                     levels will likely play different roles. So the building of productive dialogue between the
                     different levels may be very important.
                   • Strategic inflection points. Robert Burgelman and Andy Grove39 argue that all organ-
                     isations face what they call ‘strategic inflection points’ where there are shifts in funda-
                     mental industry dynamics which management need to recognise and act upon. In
                     such circumstances it may well be that the symptoms are recognised by managers
                     close to such changes who may then press for changes in strategy. The problem may
                     be that other, perhaps top, management may be busily working to maximise their
                     competitive advantage and returns in the prevailing industry structure. The result
                     could be a build-up of ‘dissonance’ within the organisation. Burgelman and Grove
                     argue that top managers need to learn when to take such dissonance seriously. This
                     relates to the challenge of organisational ambidexterity, which is discussed more fully
                     in Section 15.3.4.

13.4.2 Managing deliberate and emergent strategy
This chapter began by drawing the distinction between deliberate and emergent strategy
and has shown that in most organisations there are processes at work that are characteristic
of both. There are some issues that arise from the recognition of this:

• Unrealised strategy. There will, very likely, be aspects of a deliberate strategy that do not
  come to be realised in practice. There are several reasons for this: the environment changes
  and managers decide that the strategy, as planned, should not be put into effect; the
  plans prove to be unworkable or unacceptable in practice; or the emergent strategy comes
  to dominate. There is, however, a danger. Managers may espouse a deliberate strategy,
  perhaps the result of a strategic planning process, but the organisation may be following
  a different strategy in reality. We experience this as customers of organisations that have
  stated strategies quite different from what we experience – government agencies that are
  there purportedly to serve our interests but act as bureaucratic officialdom, companies that
  claim they offer excellent customer service but operate call centres that frustrate customers
  and fail to solve problems, universities that claim excellence of teaching but are more
  concerned with their staff’s research, or vice versa. It should not, however, be assumed that
  top managers are always close enough to customers to understand the extent of difference
  between what is intended as the strategy and what is actually happening. Managers need
  to take steps to check if the deliberate strategy is actually being realised.
• Managing deliberate strategy. Wherever there are processes of deliberate strategy
  making feedback should play an important role, not least because it may change that
  deliberate strategy. Such feedback may take different forms. The first step in strategy
  implementation – the communication of strategy throughout the organisation – may give
  rise to immediate feedback from different stakeholders arguing for adjustments to that
  strategy. Feedback can also come from organisational structures, systems and routines
  that support strategy implementation (see Chapter 14). For example, control systems set
  up to monitor the progress of a strategy may signal that key objectives are not being met.
  Similarly, key performance indicators and balance scorecards may also indicate a need
  to change the deliberate strategy (see Chapter 12). Organisational culture also plays an
  important role in strategy implementation (Chapter 6) and if it becomes clear that a
  strategy requires too radical cultural changes it may have to be adjusted.
• Managing emergent strategy. The processes of strategy development that give rise to emer-
  gent strategy may be rooted in incremental learning, political processes and organisational
  structures and systems, but they are not unmanageable. Indeed, this is as much about
  managing strategy as is strategic planning. Political processes can be analysed and managed
  (see Section 5.2.2 on stakeholder mapping) and organisational structures and resource allo-
  cation can be changed. A clear mission or vision can help direct the bottom-up strategy devel-
  opment and strategic planning systems can help coordinate the outcomes of such processes.
• The challenge of strategic drift. A major strategic challenge facing managers was identified in
  Section 6.4 as the risk of strategic drift: the tendency for strategies to develop incrementally on
  the basis of historical and cultural influences, but fail to keep pace with a changing environ-
  ment. The views and explanations of emergent strategy in Section 13.3 of this chapter suggest
  that such a pattern may be a natural outcome of the influence of political processes, organisa-
  tional structure and systems and prior strategic decisions. This further highlights that strategy
  development processes in organisations need to encourage people to have the capacity and
  willingness to challenge and change their core assumptions and ways of doing things.

                         Summary
                         This chapter has dealt with different ways in which strategy development occurs in organisa-
                         tions. The main lessons of the chapter are:
                         • It is important to distinguish between deliberate strategy – the desired strategic direction
                            deliberately planned by managers – and emergent strategy, which may develop in a less
                            deliberate way from the behaviours and activities inherent within an organisation.
                         • Most often the process of strategy development is described in terms of a deliberately formu-
                            lated intended strategy as a result of planning systems carried out objectively and dispas-
                            sionately. There are advantages and disadvantages of formal strategic planning systems.
                         • Deliberate strategy may also come about on the basis of central command, the vision of
                            strategic leaders or the imposition of strategies by external stakeholders.
                         • Strategies may emerge from within organisations. This may be explained in terms of:
                            • How organisations may proactively try to cope through processes of logical incremen-
                                talism and organisational learning.
                            • The outcome of the bargaining associated with political activity resulting in a negoti-
                                ated strategy.
                            • Strategies developing because organisational structures and systems favour some
                                strategy projects over others on the basis of resource allocation, prior strategies or
                                organisational culture.
                         • In managing strategy development processes, managers face challenges including:
                            • Recognising that different processes of strategy development may be needed in
                                different contexts.
                            • Managing the processes that may give rise to emergent strategy as well as deliberate strategy.

                              play in a public-sector organisation such as local government, a not-for-profit organ-
                              isation such as Where should the beds go?*, and a multinational corporation such as
                              Megabrew*?
                        13.4✱ Incremental patterns of strategy development are common in organisations, and
                              managers see advantages in this. However, there are also risks of strategic drift.
                              Using the different views in Sections 13.2 and 13.3, suggest how such drift might be
                              avoided.
                        13.5 Suggest why different approaches to strategy development might be appropriate
                             in different organisations such as a university, a fashion retailer, a diversified multi-
                             national corporation and a high-technology company.

                        Integrative assignment
                        13.6✱ Assume you were asked to advise a chief executive of a long-established, historic-
                              ally successful multinational business with highly experienced managers that is
                              experiencing declining profits and falling market share. What might you expect to
                              be the causes of the problems? What processes of strategy development would you
                              propose to address them?

14.1 Introduction
          Strategies only become real when they are implemented. If the American multinational
          retailer Walmart wants to implement its strategy, it needs to get 2.2 million employees spread
          over 12,000 locations worldwide all pointing in the right direction. In just the same way, a
          sports team has to ensure that all its individual members coordinate their moves according
          to their overall game plan: everybody has to know their positions and those of their team-
          mates. Thus strategies require organising and this involves both structures and systems. If
          the organisation is not consistent with the strategy, then even the cleverest strategy will fail
          because of poor implementation.
             This chapter examines organising for successful strategy implementation (sometimes
          known as strategy execution). Implementation is important because that is where strategy
          often goes wrong: strategies may fail not because they are badly chosen but because they
          are badly executed. Implementation refers to the translation of a chosen strategy into
          organisational action in order to achieve strategic goals and objectives. Implementation
          involves many aspects, including the leadership and change activities that are the focus of
          Chapter 15. However, this chapter focuses on two key elements of organisational ‘design’
          required for successful strategy implementation: organisational structures and organisa-
          tional systems. Structures give people formally defined roles, responsibilities and lines
          of reporting. These structures can be seen as the skeletons of organisations, providing the
          basic frameworks on which everything is built. Systems support and control people as they
          carry out structurally defined roles and responsibilities. Systems can be seen as the muscles
          of organisations, giving them movement and coherence. Structures and systems should fit
          particular strategies, but also allow for agility and resilience. In other words, organisations
          should be able to respond quickly to new strategic opportunities and bounce back from
          setbacks to existing strategies.
             Figure 14.1 expresses the interdependency between strategy, structure and systems.
          A starting principle of organisational design is that all three should support each other
          in a circular process of mutual reinforcement. This chapter captures the importance of
          mutual reinforcement between elements with the concept of configuration, explained
          in Section 14.5. However, the mutually reinforcing nature of configurations can create

                   not only virtuous circles of performance, but also problems of strategic control. Logic-
                   ally it seems that strategic priorities should determine structure and systems. But the
                   circular nature of Figure 14.1 captures the potential for structures and systems to feed
                   into strategy. Structure and systems are not always the logical supports of strategy; some-
                   times, they shape it, consciously or not. Structures and systems are not simple matters of
                   strategy implementation. In line with the overlapping circles of the Exploring Strategy
                   model (Figure 1.1), structures and systems can also influence strategy formation (see also
                   Section 13.3.3).
                      The chapter therefore addresses the following topics:

                   • Structures, particularly functional, divisional, matrix, project and transnational structures.
                   • Systems, such as performance targeting and planning.
                   • Agility and resilience in structures and systems.
                   • Configurations, as encapsulated in the McKinsey 7-S framework.

                   The chapter concludes by considering new non-hierarchical structures and systems in
                   Thinking Differently.



14.2 Structural types
                   As above, it is important that organisations choose the right structures for their strat-
                   egies. Structural charts define the levels and roles in an organisation. They describe who
                   reports to whom in terms of management and who is responsible for what in terms of
                   activities. They have major implications for how managers interact internally. They also
                   have implications for how organisations face out into the marketplace. Which managers
                   get to interact with customers and suppliers is determined by structural roles. Structure
                   should fit strategy.
                      This section reviews five basic structural types: functional, divisional, matrix, transnational
                   and project.1 Broadly, the first two of these tend to emphasise one structural dimension
                   (or ‘axis’) over another, either functional specialisms or business divisions. The three that
                   follow tend to mix structural dimensions more evenly, for instance trying to give product and
                   geographical units equal weight. However, none of these structures is a universal solution to
                   the challenges of organising. Rather, the right structure depends on the particular strategic
                   challenges each organisation faces. These challenges are often called contingencies.2 This
                   implies that the first step in organisational design is deciding what the key strategic chal-
                   lenges facing the organisation actually are. Section 14.2.6 will particularly focus on how the
                   five structural types fit the strategic challenges of diversification (Chapter 8), international-
                   isation (Chapter 9) and innovation (Chapter 10).


                   14.2.1 The functional structure
                   Even a small entrepreneurial start-up, once it involves more than one person, needs to
                   divide up responsibilities between different people. The functional structure divides
                   responsibilities according to the organisation’s primary specialist roles such as produc-
                   tion, marketing and finance. It is particularly effective for specialised organisations with
                   undiversified strategies. Figure 14.2 represents a typical organisation chart for such a func-
                   tional organisation. This kind of structure is particularly relevant to small or start-up organ-
                   isations, or larger organisations that have retained narrow, rather than diverse, product

                   ranges. Functional structures may also be used within a multidivisional structure (see
                   below), where the divisions themselves may split themselves up according to functional
                   departments (as in Figure 14.2).
                      Figure 14.2 summarises the potential advantages and disadvantages of a functional
                   structure. There are three key advantages. First, functional structures give top manage-
                   ment direct hands-on involvement in key activities, from operations to human resources,
                   and allows greater operational control from the top. Second, the functional structure
                   provides a clear definition of roles and tasks, increasing accountability: the marketing
                   director is responsible for marketing and should not directly intervene in operations.
                   Third, functional departments provide concentrations of expertise, thus fostering know-
                   ledge development in areas of functional specialism. All the marketing executives are
                   together.
                      However, there are at least two potential disadvantages to functional structures, partic-
                   ularly as organisations become larger or more diverse. First, centralisation means that func-
                   tional structures are not good at coping with product or geographical diversity. For example,
                   a central marketing department may try to impose a uniform approach to advertising regard-
                   less of the diverse needs of the organisation’s various markets around the world. Second,
                   in a fast-moving environment, senior managers may focus too much on their functional
                   responsibilities, becoming overburdened with routine operations and too concerned with
                   narrow functional interests: marketing managers focus just on marketing, while operations
                   managers focus on operations, and both lack an overall strategic view. As a result, functional
                   managers find it hard to respond to long-term strategic issues.


                   14.2.2 The divisional structure
                   A divisional structure is built up of separate divisions on the basis of products, services or
                   geographical areas (see Figure 14.3). Divisionalisation often comes about as an attempt
                   to overcome the problems that functional structures have in dealing with the diversity
                   mentioned above.3 The key principle is decentralisation. Under divisionalisation, divisional
                   managers typically have sufficient freedom to respond to the specific requirements of their
                   product/market strategy, using their own set of functional departments. Top management
                   typically does not interfere, but monitors the outcomes of divisional managers’ choices
                   from corporate headquarters. A similar situation exists in many public services, where the
                   organisation is structured around service departments such as recreation, social services

                    and education. Large and complex divisional companies may even have a second tier of
                    subdivisions within their main divisions: thus a diversified automobile company may have
                    geographic subdivisions within separate car and trucks divisions, for instance a Trucks (Asia)
                    subdivision.
                       There are at least three potential advantages to divisional structures. First, it is possible for
                    head office to control divisions from a distance simply by monitoring their business perform-
                    ance: top management need only intervene if targets are being missed (see Illustration 14.2
                    on Google and Section 14.4.3). For divisions, this detachment means less meddling from
                    the top; for the head office, this means less distraction by operational details. Second, there
                    can be benefits of specialisation within a division, allowing competences to develop with a
                    clearer focus on a particular product group, technology or customer group. Thus a division
                    can become expert in serving a distinctive set of customers, for instance in a region or market
                    segment. Third, having divisions provides flexibility because organisations can add, close or
                    merge divisions as the strategy changes. Diversification into a new market can be accommo-
                    dated simply by adding a new division focused on that market.
                       However, divisional structures can also have three key disadvantages. First, divisions can
                    become so self-sufficient that they are effectively independent businesses, duplicating the
                    functions and costs of the corporate centre of the company: every division has its own human
                    resources department for instance. Second, divisions may become too autonomous, espe-
                    cially where joint ventures and partnerships with other companies dilute ownership. Here,
                    divisions pursue their own strategies almost regardless of the needs of the corporate parent.
                    In these cases, divisional companies become holding companies, where the corporate centre
                    effectively ‘holds’ the various businesses in a largely financial sense, exercising little control
                    and adding little value. Finally, divisionalisation tends to get in the way of cooperation and
                    knowledge-sharing between business units: divisions can quite literally divide. Expertise is
                    fragmented and division-specific performance targets provide little incentive to collaborate
                    with other divisions. Figure 14.3 summarises these potential advantages and disadvantages
                    of a multidivisional structure.

                   14.2.3 The matrix structure
                   A matrix structure combines different structural dimensions (axes) simultaneously, for
                   example product divisions and geographical territories or product divisions and functional
                   specialisms.4 In matrix structures, staff typically report to two managers rather than one.
                   This dual reporting makes matrix structures complex, but they can be effective responses
                   to today’s complex environments. Figure 14.4 gives examples of such a structure: a multi-
                   national and a school.
                      Matrix structures are potentially attractive as they can combine the advantages of
                   different dimensions at the same time. Thus, Figure 14.4 shows how a school might combine
                   separate subject specialisms with particular age cohorts of pupils: there might be heads of
                   languages or sciences, who would lead their subject specialists, as well as heads of lower,
                   middle and upper school cohorts, who would coordinate particular cohorts of students: an
                   individual teacher would report both to subject specialism head (e.g. languages) and to the
                   head of a pupil group, e.g. middle school. Similarly, a consulting firm might have both sector
                   heads who understand clients in particular markets, for example heads of energy or retail,
                   and heads of expert groups, for example heads of information technology or strategy: an
                   individual consultant might report to the heads of both energy and strategy. In each case,
                   the organisation benefits from specialised expertise, at the same time as being responsive
                   to particular client needs.

   However, replacing single lines of authority with cross-matrix relationships can bring
at least two problems. There may be conflict because staff find themselves responsible to
managers from two structural axes: as above, the energy head may want different things to
the strategy head. Also, it will typically take longer to reach decisions because of bargaining
between the managers of different axes. If conflict and delays proliferate, matrix organisa-
tions can be both inefficient and inflexible.
   As with any structure, but particularly with the matrix structure, the critical issue in prac-
tice is the way it actually works (i.e. behaviours and relationships). The key ingredient in a
successful matrix structure can be senior managers who are good at sustaining collaborative
relationships (across the matrix) and coping with the messiness and ambiguity which that
can bring. It is for this reason that the matrix is sometimes described as involving a ‘frame of
mind’ as much as a formal structure.5


14.2.4 Multinational/transnational structures
Operating internationally adds an extra dimension to the structural challenge. As in
Figure 14.5, there are essentially four structural designs available for multinationals. Three
are simple extensions of the principles of the divisional structure (Section 14.3.2), so are dealt
with briefly. The fourth, the transnational structure, is more complex and will be explained
at more length.
   The three simpler multinational structures are as follows:

• International divisions. An international division is a standalone division added alongside
  the structure of the main home-based business. This is often the kind of structure adopted
  by corporations with large domestic markets (such as in the USA or China), where an
  initial entry into overseas markets is relatively small scale and does not require structural
  change to the original, much bigger, home businesses. For example, a Chinese car, truck
  and motorbike manufacturer might have separate divisions for each of its product areas
  in its home market of China, but run its overseas businesses in a separate ‘international

                      division’ combining all three product areas together. The international division is typically
                      run from headquarters, but not integrated with the domestic business. As in Figure 14.5,
                      the international division is centralised, but not highly coordinated with other parts of
                      the business.
                   • Local subsidiaries. These subsidiaries typically have most of the functions required to
                     operate on their own in their particular local market, for example design, production and
                     marketing. They are thus a form of geographic divisional structure. They have high local
                     responsiveness and are loosely coordinated. A local subsidiary structure is very common
                     in professional services such as law, accounting and advertising, where there are few
                     economies of scale and responsiveness to local regulations, relationships or tastes is very
                     important. This structure fits the multi-domestic strategy introduced in Chapter 9.
                   • Global product divisions. This kind of structure is often used where economies of scale
                     are very important. Organising the design, production and marketing on the basis of
                     global divisions rather than local subsidiaries typically maximises cost efficiency. It also
                     helps direct central resources to targeted markets and facilitates cross-subsidisation of
                     unprofitable geographical markets. To return to the Chinese car, truck and motorbike
                     manufacturer, there would be just three divisions, each responsible for its particular
                     product area across the whole world, China included. There would be very little scope for
                     adaptation to local tastes or regulations in particular markets. In global product divisions,
                     local responsiveness would typically be very low. This structure fits the global strategy
                     introduced in Chapter 9. It is also similar to Alphabet’s basic structural approach (see
                     Illustration 14.2).

                      The international division, local subsidiary and global product division structures all have
                   their particular advantages, whether it is managing relative size, maximising local respon-
                   siveness or achieving economies of scale. The fourth structure, however, tries to integrate
                   the advantages of the local subsidiary structure with those of the global product divisional
                   structure.
                      In terms of Figure 14.5, the transnational structure combines local responsiveness with
                   high global coordination.6 Transnational structures are similar to matrices but distinguish
                   themselves by their focus on knowledge-sharing, specialisation and network management,
                   as follows:

                   • Knowledge-sharing. While each national or regional business has a good deal of autonomy,
                     in the transnational they should see themselves as sources of ideas and capabilities for
                     the whole corporation. Thus a good idea that has been developed locally is offered for
                     adoption by other national or regional units around the world. This promotes innovation.
                   • Specialisation. National (or regional) units specialise in areas of expertise in order to
                     achieve greater scale economies on behalf of the whole corporation. Thus a national unit
                     that has particular competences in manufacturing a particular product, for example, may
                     be given responsibility for manufacturing that product on behalf of other units across the
                     world. Specialisation is usually highly efficient.
                   • Network management. The corporate centre has the role of managing this global network
                     of specialisms and knowledge. It does so first by establishing the specialist role of each
                     business unit, then sustaining the systems and relationships required to make the network
                     of business units operate in an integrated and effective manner.

                      The success of a transnational corporation is dependent on the ability to achieve simul-
                   taneously global competences, local responsiveness and organisation-wide innovation and
                   learning. Theoretically the transnational combines the best of local decentralisation with the
                   best of global centralisation. However, the transnational can be very demanding of managers

                   in terms of willingness to work not just at their national business units but for the good
                   of the transnational as a whole. Diffuse responsibilities also make for similar complexities
                   and control problems to those of the matrix organisation.7 These sources of inefficiency can
                   outweigh the efficiency benefits of specialisation.


                   14.2.5 Project-based structures8
                   Many organisations rely heavily on project teams with a finite life span. A project-based struc-
                   ture is one where teams are created, undertake a specific project and are then dissolved.9
                   This can be particularly appropriate for organisations that involve goods or services that are
                   large and take time to deliver (infrastructure, information systems, films) and those delivering
                   time-limited events (conferences, sporting events or consulting engagements). The organ-
                   isation structure is a constantly changing collection of project teams created, steered and
                   glued together loosely by a small corporate group. Many organisations use such teams in a
                   more ad hoc way to complement the ‘main’ structure. For example, projects or task forces
                   are set up to make progress on new elements of strategy (for example acquisitions or new
                   business initiatives) or to provide momentum where the regular structure of the organisation
                   is not effective.
                       The project-based structure can be highly flexible, with projects being set up and dissolved
                   as required. Because project teams should have clear tasks to achieve within a defined period,
                   accountability and control are good. As project team members will typically be drawn from
                   different departments within the firm, projects can be effective at knowledge exchange. Pro-
                   jects can also draw on members internationally and, because project life spans are typically
                   short, project teams may be more willing to work temporarily around the world. There are
                   disadvantages, however. The constant breaking up of project teams can hinder the accumu-
                   lation of knowledge within specialisms. Every project requires investment in team-building
                   before actually starting work. Consequently, without careful management, project-based
                   structures can be inefficient.


                   14.2.6 Strategy and structure fit
                   This section considers how the various structures fit the key strategies of diversification, inter-
                   nationalisation and innovation introduced in Chapters 8, 9 and 10. It then considers design
                   tests for the appropriate structure.
                      Structural fit is crucial to strategy implementation. One of the strategy discipline’s
                   founders, Alfred Chandler, documents how major corporations such as DuPont and General
                   Motors nearly went bankrupt: the reason was not badly chosen strategies, but a misfit
                   between their diversified strategies (DuPont made a wide range of chemicals) and their
                   centralised structures. Chandler sums up the importance of fitting structure to strategy by
                   saying: ‘Unless structure follows strategy, inefficiency results.’10
                      Table 14.1 summarises in relative terms the typical benefits of the fits between different
                   structures and strategies of diversification, internationalisation and innovation (organisa-
                   tions and strategies vary in detail, so benefits may differ in particular cases). Key points are
                   highlighted in the following:

                   • Diversification raises the corporate strategy challenges of control and accountability
                     within widely different businesses, as discussed in Chapter 8. Divisionalisation responds
                     effectively to diversification because it allows different businesses enough decentralised
                     responsibility to enact their own strategies, while the corporate parent can exercise
                     control by monitoring business performance. Matrix structures are less effective as they
                     blur accountability: business units are burdened with horizontal responsibilities as well

   as upwards accountability. The functional structure is generally too centralised to allow
   effective diversification.
• Internationalisation strategies raise dilemmas over global scale, horizontal coordination
  and local adaptation, as discussed in Chapter 9. Matrix and transnational structures are
  particularly effective in accommodating both sides of such dilemmas: for example, one
  axis could allow for scale, the other could allow for coordination or sharing. Divisional
  structures tend to resolve these dilemmas more unilaterally, either allowing centralised
  product divisions for scale or local subsidiaries for local adaptation. They tend to be less
  good at horizontal coordination and sharing.
• Innovation strategies typically require knowledge creation and knowledge-sharing, as
  discussed in Chapters 4 and 10. Matrix organisations are good for horizontal sharing.
  Project organisations can bring together teams of relevant experts to focus intensively
  on innovation initiatives. The functional structure can be effective in innovation because
  centralisation concentrates resources, particularly research and development. Divisional
  structures tend to divide knowledge, potentially harming innovation.

  While Table 14.1 considers the typical fits between strategies and structures, these are
not always achievable in practice. Goold and Campbell’s design tests remind us of four other
important principles:11

• The People Test. The structural design must fit the people available. It is dangerous to
  switch completely from a functional structure to a multidivisional structure if, as is likely,
  the organisation lacks managers with competence in running decentralised business units.
• The Feasibility Test. This is a catch-all category, indicating that the structure must fit legal,
  stakeholder, trade union or similar constraints. For example, after scandals involving
  biased research, investment banks are now required by financial regulators to separate
  their research departments from their deal-making departments.
• The Difficult Links Test. This test asks whether a proposed structure will set up links
  between parts of the organisations that are important but bound to be strained. For
  example, extreme decentralisation to profit-accountable business units is likely to strain
  relationships with a central research and development department. Unless compensating
  mechanisms are put in place, this kind of structure is likely to fail.
• The Flexibility Test. A final important test is whether the design will be sufficiently flexible
  to accommodate possible changes in the future. Here Kathleen Eisenhardt argues for
  structural ‘modularity’ (i.e. standardisation) in order to allow easy ‘patching’ (i.e. transfer)
  of one part of the organisation to another part of the organisation, as market needs
  change.12 For example, if strategic business units are similar in structural size, pay rates
  and internal management systems throughout a large organisation, it becomes easy to
  transfer them from one division to another according to changing business needs.

  However, it is important to realise that in practice managers do not start from scratch in
choosing their organisational structures. Structure does not always follow logically from

                                                                                                 445
Chapter 14 Organising and strategy


                   strategy; rather, existing structures can shape the strategy (see Chapter 13). Thus a business
                   with an existing multidivisional structure may continue with an acquisitions and divestments
                   strategy simply because that structure makes it easy just to keep on adding and subtracting
                   various businesses as divisional units. Conversely a functional organisation might be reluctant
                   to undertake acquisitions because it is hard to integrate within its centralised structure. Thus
                   the structure can reinforce the current strategy, regardless of whether the strategy is a good
                   one.13 Moreover, not only is it hard to fit strategy and structure as logic seems to dictate,
                   but managers also have to align them with the other key part of the configuration, organ-
                   isational systems. As in Figure 14.1, systems too should be designed to reinforce strategy
                   and structure.



14.3 Systems
                   Structure is a key ingredient in strategy implementation. But structures can only work if they
                   are supported by formal and informal organisational systems, the ‘muscles’ of the organisa-
                   tion. Systems such as planning and targeting help ensure control over strategy implementa-
                   tion. Small organisations may be able to rely on direct supervision, where a single manager or
                   entrepreneur monitors activity in person. But larger or more complex organisations typically
                   need more elaborate structures and systems if they are to be effective over time (though
                   see Thinking Differently on non-hierarchical systems, at the end of this chapter). This section
                   considers four systems specifically: planning, performance targeting, culture and internal
                   markets.
                      Such systems can be subdivided in two ways. First, systems tend to emphasise either
                   control over inputs or control over outputs. Input control systems concern themselves with
                   the resources consumed in the strategy, especially financial resources and human commit-
                   ment. Output control systems focus on ensuring satisfactory results, for example the meeting
                   of targets or achieving market competitiveness. The second subdivision is between direct and
                   indirect controls. Direct controls involve close supervision or monitoring. Indirect controls
                   are more hands-off, setting up the conditions whereby desired behaviours are achieved
                   semi-automatically. Table 14.2 summarises how the four systems of planning, performance
                   targeting, culture and internal markets each emphasise input or output controls and direct
                   or indirect controls.
                      Organisations normally use a blend of these control systems, but some will dominate
                   over others according to the nature of strategic challenges. As we shall see, direct measures
                   tend to require that the controllers have high levels of knowledge of what the controlled
                   are supposed to do. In many knowledge-intensive organisations, especially those gener-
                   ating innovation and change, controllers rarely have a good understanding of what their
                   expert employees are doing, nor can they easily define what they are potentially capable
                   of doing. In these conditions, it is usually better to rely on indirect controls such as perform-
                   ance targeting: at least controllers can know when a unit has made its revenue or profit-
                   ability targets. Direct control works better in simple and steady businesses, where input

requirements are stable and well understood, or where key outcomes are unambiguous.
Utility businesses supplying power or water might respond well to direct forms of control.


14.3.1 Planning systems
Planning systems govern the allocation of resources and monitor their utilisation. The focus
is on the direct control of inputs. These might be simple financial inputs (as in budgeting),
human inputs (as in planning for managerial succession) or long-term investments (as partic-
ularly in strategic planning). Tight control over inputs is often efficient, reducing waste.
However, planning systems can be too rigid and fail to anticipate rapid change: planning
therefore may sometimes reduce flexibility. This section introduces three types of planning
system operated from the corporate centre, developing the more general discussion of stra-
tegic planning in Chapter 13.
    Goold and Campbell’s14 typology of three corporate strategy styles helps to identify the
advantages and disadvantages of planning systems against other methods of corporate
central oversight. The three strategy styles differ widely along two dimensions: the domi-
nant source of planning influence, either top-down (from the corporate centre to the
business units) or bottom-up (from the business units to the centre); and the degree of
performance accountability for the business units, either tight or reasonably relaxed. As
in Figure 14.6, the three corporate strategy styles align themselves on these two dimen-
sions thus:

• The strategic planning style is the archetypal planning system, hence its name. In the
  Goold and Campbell sense, the strategic planning style combines both a strong plan-
  ning influence on strategic direction from the corporate centre with relatively relaxed
  performance accountability for the business units. The logic is that if the centre sets the
  strategic direction, business unit managers should not be held strictly accountable for
  disappointing results that might be due to an inappropriate plan in the first place. In
  the strategic planning style, the centre focuses on inputs in terms of allocating resources
  necessary to achieve the strategic plan, while exercising a high degree of direct control
  over how the plan is executed by the businesses.

                   • The financial control style involves very little central planning. The business units each set
                     their own strategic plans, probably after some negotiation with the corporate centre,
                     and are then held strictly accountable for the results against these plans. This style differs
                     from the strategic planning style in that control is against financial outputs, similar to a
                     performance targeting system (see Section 14.4.3). If the businesses devised the plans,
                     then they should take full responsibility for success or failure. Business unit managers
                     in the financial control style have a lot of autonomy and typically receive high bonus
                     payments for success. But failure may easily lead to dismissal. The financial planning style
                     fits with the portfolio manager or restructurer roles of the corporate centre referred to in
                     Chapter 8.
                   • The strategic control style is in the middle, with a more consensual development of the
                     strategic plan between the corporate centre and the business units and moderate levels
                     of business unit accountability. Under the strategic control style, the centre will typically
                     act as coach to its business unit managers, helping them to see and seize opportunities in
                     a supportive manner. This style often relies on strong cultural systems to foster trust and
                     mutual understanding (see Section 14.4.3). Consequently, the strategic control style is
                     often associated with the synergy manager or parental developer roles of the corporate
                     centre discussed in Chapter 8.

                       Thus the three corporate strategy styles vary with regard to their reliance on, and application
                   of, planning systems. The direct control of inputs characteristic of the strategic planning style
                   is only appropriate in certain circumstances. In particular, it makes sense where there are large,
                   risky and long-range investments to be allocated: for example, an oil company typically has to
                   take the decision to invest in the ten-year development of an oilfield at the corporate centre,
                   rather than risk delegating it to business units whose resources and time horizons may be
                   limited. On the other hand, the financial control style is suitable where investments are small,
                   relatively frequent and well understood, as typically in a mature, non-capital-intensive business.
                       The strategic planning style (not necessarily the practice of strategic planning in general)
                   has become less common in the private sector in recent years.15 The style is seen as too rigid
                   to adapt to changing circumstances and too top-down to reflect real business circumstances
                   on the ground. However, it is important to recognise the internal consistency of all three
                   styles, including strategic planning. Each achieves logical combinations of accountability and
                   strategic influence. Problems occur when organisations construct systems of planning and
                   accountability that depart substantially from the diagonal line in Figure 14.6. Too far below
                   the line (the ‘south-west’ corner) implies an excessively relaxed combination of weak direc-
                   tion from the centre and low accountability for the businesses. Too far above the diagonal
                   line (the ‘north-east’ corner) implies a harsh combination of strong direction from the centre
                   and strict accountability in the businesses. In the ‘north-east’ corner, business managers are
                   held accountable even for mistakes that may have their origins in the centre’s own plans.


                   14.3.2 Cultural systems
                   Organisations typically have distinctive cultures which express basic assumptions and beliefs
                   held by organisation members and define taken-for-granted ways of doing things (see
                   Chapter 6). Despite their taken-for-granted, semi-conscious nature, organisational cultures
                   can seem a tempting means of managerial control. Cultures exercise an indirect form of
                   control, because of not requiring direct supervision: it becomes a matter of willing conformity
                   or self-control by employees. Control is exerted on the input of employees, as the culture
                   defines the appropriate effort and initiative that employees themselves choose to put into
                   their jobs. Thus cultural mechanisms aim to standardise norms of behaviour within an organ-
                   isation in line with particular objectives.

                                                                                 14.3 Systems


   Managers may therefore try to influence organisational culture through various delib-
erate mechanisms in order to make employee behave consistently with their strategy.16
   Three key cultural mechanisms are:

• Recruitment. Here cultural conformity may be attempted by the selection of appropriate
  staff in the first place. Employers look to find people who will ‘fit’. Thus some employers
  may favour recruiting people who have already shown themselves to be ‘team-players’
  through sport or other activities.
• Socialisation. Here employee behaviours are shaped by social processes once they are at
  work. It often starts with the integration of new staff through training, induction and
  mentoring programmes. It typically continues with further training throughout a career.
  Symbols can also play a role in socialisation, for example the symbolic example of leaders’
  behaviours or the influence of office décor, dress codes or language.
• Reward. Appropriate behaviour can be encouraged through pay, promotion or symbolic
  processes (e.g. public praise). The desire to achieve the same rewards as successful people
  in the organisation will typically encourage imitative behaviour.

   However, cultures are double-edged. To the extent that employees are willing to adapt
spontaneously to the organisation’s changing needs without direct top-down commands,
cultural systems can foster adaptability. For example, workers often form spontaneous and
informal ‘communities of practice’, in which expert practitioners inside or even outside the
organisation share their knowledge to generate innovative solutions to problems on their
own initiative: for example, programmer networks support the development of Linux ‘free-
ware’ internationally over the internet.17 On the other hand, over time cultures can become
conservative, resistant to change. Aspects of organisational culture can frequently get in the
way of managerial intentions, as when peer-group pressure causes resistance to organisa-
tional policies or encourage cynicism and ‘going through the motions’. As in Chapter 6, the
culture of an organisation can even drive its strategy.


14.3.3 Performance targeting systems
Performance targets focus on the outputs of an organisation (or part of an organisation), such
as product quality, revenues or profits. These targets are often known as key performance
indicators (KPIs) (see also Chapter 12). Targets should measure how well the strategy is being
implemented. However, within specified boundaries, there is often freedom on how targets
are exactly achieved.
   Performance targeting can be particularly appropriate in certain situations:

• Within large businesses, corporate centres may choose performance targets to control
  their business units without getting involved in the details of how they achieve them (as
  in the financial control style in Section 14.4.1). These targets are often cascaded down the
  organisation as specific targets for subunits, functions and even individuals.
• In regulated markets, such as privatised utilities in the United Kingdom and elsewhere,
  government-appointed regulators increasingly exercise control through agreed key
  performance indicators (KPIs), such as service or quality levels, as a means of ensuring
  ‘competitive’ performance.18
• In the public services, where control of resource inputs was the dominant approach
  historically, governments are attempting to move control processes towards outputs (such
  as quality of service) and, more importantly, towards outcomes (e.g. patient mortality

  Many managers find it difficult to develop a useful set of targets. There are at least three
potential problems with targets:19

• Inappropriate measures of performance are quite common. For example, managers
  often prefer indicators that are easily measured or choose measures based on inad-
  equate understanding of real needs on the ground. The result is a focus on the required
  measures rather than the factors that might be essential to long-term success. In the
  private sector, focus on short-term profit measures is common, at the expense of
  long-run competitive advantage. For example, it is often easier to measure the costs of
  R&D or advertising than the benefits, with the result that these long-term investments
  get curtailed.
• Inappropriate target levels are a common problem. Managers are liable to give their super-
  iors pessimistic forecasts so that targets are set at undemanding levels, which can then
  be easily met. On the other hand, superiors may over-compensate for their managers’
  pessimism, and end up setting excessively demanding targets. Unrealistically ambitious
  targets can either demotivate employees who see no hope of achieving them regardless
  of their effort, or encourage risky or dishonest behaviours in order to achieve the other-
  wise impossible. To the extent that they encourage pessimism or demotivation, inappro-
  priate measures tend to work against innovation and change.
• Excessive internal competition can be a result of targets focused on individual or subunit
  performance. These individual or subunit targets are incompatible with each other. If
  individuals or subunits are being rewarded on their performance in isolation, they will
  have little incentive to collaborate with the other parts of the organisation. The struggle
  to meet individualistic targets will reduce the exchange of information and the sharing
  of resources.

    These acknowledged difficulties with targets have led to the development of two tech-
niques designed to encourage a more balanced approach to target-setting. The most
fundamental technique has been the development of the balanced scorecard approach.20
As discussed in Section 13.2, balanced scorecards set performance targets according to a
range of perspectives, not only financial. A second more balanced, approach to target-setting
is strategy mapping, developing the balanced scorecard idea. Strategy maps link different
performance targets into a mutually supportive causal chain supporting strategic objectives.
Figure 14.7 shows an extract of a strategy map for a delivery company based on the four
perspectives of finance, customers, internal processes, and innovation and learning. In this
map, investments in well-trained and motivated drivers under the heading of ‘innovation
and learning’ lead to on-time deliveries under the heading of ‘internal processes’, and thence
to satisfied customers and finally to profitable growth. The causal chain between the various
targets underlines the need for balance between them: each depends on the others for
achievement. Thus strategy maps help in reducing the problem of partial measures referred
to above; the problems of inappropriate target levels and internal competition are not so
easily resolved.


14.3.4 Market systems
Market disciplines (or internal markets) can be brought inside organisations to control activ-
ities internally.21 Market systems typically involve some formalised system of ‘contracting’
for resources or inputs from other parts of an organisation and for supplying outputs to
other parts of an organisation. Control focuses on outputs, for example revenues earned in
successful competition for internal contracts. The control is indirect: rather than accepting
detailed performance targets, units have simply to earn their keep in competitive internal

                   markets. Units have freedom to decide exactly how they will achieve required outputs,
                   increasing adaptability on the ground.
                      Internal markets can be used in a variety of ways. There might be competitive bidding,
                   perhaps through the creation of an internal venture capital unit at the corporate centre
                   to support new initiatives. Also, a customer–supplier relationship may be established
                   between a central service department, such as training or IT, and the operating units.
                   Typically these internal markets are subject to considerable regulation. For example,
                   the corporate centre might set rules for transfer prices between internal business units
                   to prevent exploitative contract pricing, or insist on service-level agreements to ensure
                   appropriate service by an essential internal supplier, such as IT, for the various units that
                   depend on it.
                      Internal markets work well where complexity or rapid change makes detailed direct
                   or input controls impractical. But market systems can create problems as well. First, they
                   can increase bargaining between units, consuming important management time. Second,
                   they may create a new bureaucracy monitoring all of the internal transfers of resources
                   between units. Third, an overzealous use of market mechanisms can lead to dysfunctional
                   competition and legalistic contracting, destroying cultures of collaboration and relation-

                   mous hospitals introduced in the UK’s National Health Service. On the other hand, their
                   proponents claim that these market processes free a traditionally over-centralised health
                   service to innovate and respond to local needs, while market disciplines maintain overall
                   control.

14.4 Agility and resilience
                   The previous two sections have indicated particular advantages for different kinds of
                   structures and systems. However, there are two underlying principles that organisations
                   have increasingly to pay attention to, especially as many environments are becoming
                   faster-moving and more prone to unexpected shocks: strategic agility and strategic
                   resilience.

                   • Agility refers to the ability of organisations to detect and respond to strategic oppor-
                     tunities and threats fast and easily.22 Agile organisations anticipate environmental shifts
                     and act on them as they emerge. Agility is closely associated with dynamic capabilities
                     (see Chapter 4), involving capabilities in sensing, seizing and reconfiguring. Organisations
                     may invest in agility because of the dynamism of their environments, reflecting rapid
                     technological change or frequent shifts in markets. Thus hi-tech and fashion businesses
                     often prize agility. A company like Microsoft has proven agile over the last half-century,
                     transitioning through several technological revolutions as it has moved from software
                     inserted into computers via a physical disc to software accessed on smartphones from the
                     cloud. Microsoft increases its agility by investing heavily in R&D.
                   • Resilience refers to the capacity of organisations to recover from environmental
                     shocks fast and easily after they have happened.23 Resilient organisations are good at
                     rebounding from significant setbacks. While agility involves the anticipation of environ-
                     mental change in advance, resilience foregrounds recovery from change after the event.
                     Resilience is important in turbulent environments, where organisations are at risk of signif-
                     icant unanticipated shocks: for example, the failure of key customers or suppliers, extreme
                     weather events (tsunamis or earthquakes), or sudden changes in government policy. Since
                     the Global Financial Crisis of 2008, international banks have been obliged by regulators
                     to increase their resilience to unexpected financial crises by building up their financial
                     reserves.

                   Strategic agility can be enhanced by investing in R&D, developing highly flexible staff or
                   through strategy techniques such as scenario planning (Chapter 2). Strategic resilience can be
                   increased by building financial reserves or creating buffer stocks in vulnerable supply chains.
                   However, both structures and systems can also boost agility or resilience.

                   • Agile structures and systems. Project and matrix organisation structures tend to enhance
                     agility. Projects can relatively easily be either set up or closed down; dual reporting lines
                     in matrix organisations help to absorb and share knowledge about new opportun-
                     ities and threats. Decentralised market systems can also support agility, as they allow
                     managers on the ground to respond quickly to events. On the other hand, rigid planning
                     systems or performance targets tend to inhibit agility: managers become too focused
                     on following plans or meeting targets set in the past, rather than responding to events
                     as they happen.
                   • Resilient structures and systems. Divisional organisational structures tend to be resilient,
                     because shocks can often be isolated in one particular division, insulating other parts
                     of the organisation. Some cultures can be resilient too, for instance by cultivating
                     loyalty or commitment in hard times. On the other hand, functional organisational
                     structures tend to be more fragile, because centralisation of key functions means that
                     the whole organisation is liable to get involved in any crisis. Systems relying on rigid
                     plans and targets are also typically less resilient, because once a shock has made initial
                     plans or targets out-of-date, managers may struggle to retrieve a sense of direction
                     on their own.

              Strategic agility and resilience are not costless of course. Agility requires investment in
          R&D and training; resilience often involves building various kinds of reserves. Adopting a
          project structure might be good for resilience, but it might also introduce inefficiencies that
          other structures could have prevented. Managers must judge how much they need to invest
          in strategic agility and resilience before finally determining their most appropriate structures
          and systems.



14.5 Configurations
          The introduction of this chapter introduced the concept of configurations. Configurations
          are the set of organisational design elements that fit together in order to support the
          intended strategy. The introductory Figure 14.1 focused on the three mutually supporting
          elements of strategy, structure and systems, but this section will add more elements in the
          form of the McKinsey 7-S framework. When all the various elements fit together, they can
          form a self-reinforcing virtuous circle of superior performance.
             Developed by the McKinsey consulting company, the McKinsey 7-S framework highlights
          the importance of fit between not just strategy, structure and systems, but also with staff,
          style, skills and superordinate goals.24 All seven elements have to be configured together
          to achieve effectiveness. The elements can therefore serve as a checklist in any organisa-
          tional design exercise: see Figure 14.8. Because we have already addressed strategy, structure

Chapter 14 Organising and strategy


                   and systems, we shall focus on the remaining four elements of the 7-S framework in the
                   following:

                   • Style here refers to the leadership style of top managers in an organisation. Leader-
                     ship styles may be collaborative, participative, directive or coercive, for instance (see
                     Chapter 15). Managers’ behavioural style can influence the culture of the whole organ-
                     isation (see Chapter 6). The style should fit other aspects of the 7-S framework: for
                     example, a highly directive or coercive style is not likely to fit a matrix organisation
                     structure.
                   • Staff is about the kinds of people in the organisation and how they are developed.
                     This relates to systems of recruitment, socialisation and reward (Section 14.4.2). A key
                     criterion for the feasibility of any strategy is: does the organisation have the people
                     to match (see Section 12.4.2)? A common constraint on structural change is the avail-
                     ability of the right people to head new departments and divisions (the ‘People Test’: see
                     Section 14.3.6).
                   • Skills relates to staff, but in the 7-S framework refers more broadly to capabilities in general
                     (see Chapter 4). The concept of capabilities here raises not only staff skills but also issues
                     to do with how these skills are embedded in and captured by the organisation as a whole.
                     For example, how do the organisation’s training schemes, information technology and
                     reward systems transform the talents of individuals into the organisational capabilities
                     required by the strategy?
                   • Superordinate goals (sometimes known as shared values) refers to the overarching goals
                     or purpose of the organisation as a whole, in other words the mission, vision and object-
                     ives that form the organisational purpose (see Chapter 1). Superordinate (i.e. overarching)
                     goals are placed at the centre of the 7-S framework: all other elements should support
                     these.

                       The McKinsey 7-S framework highlights at least three aspects of organising. First, organ-
                   ising involves a lot more than just getting the organisational structure right; there are many
                   other elements to attend to. Second, the 7-S framework emphasises fit between all these
                   elements: everything from structure to skills needs to be configured together in order to
                   create virtuous circles of efficient performance. Third, if managers change one element of
                   the 7-S, the concept of fit suggests they are likely to have to change all the other elements
                   as well in order to keep them all appropriately aligned to each other. Changing one element
                   in isolation is liable to break the virtuous circle and make performance worse until overall
                   fit is restored.25
                       Although the concept of configurations and the 7-S framework emphasise the value of
                   mutual fit between elements, in practice this can cause problems in terms of adaptability.
                   First, making everything fit tightly together makes it hard to adapt to specific needs:
                   adjusting to the demands of one particular market is liable to spoil the configuration
                   required to respond to the demands of all the others. One solution to this is to subdivide
                   the organisation into different strategic business units, so that the one unit is configured
                   optimally according to one set of demands, while the other unit is configured optimally
                   for the others. For example, IBM created its then revolutionary personal computer in
                   a separate new-venture division, configured differently to the traditional mainframe
                   computer business whose principles of hierarchy and efficiency were incompatible with
                   the need to innovate in the new business. 26 Second, as above, configurations create
                   problems for change. Tight fits in terms of configurations can make it costly to adapt:
                   changing just a few elements leads to performance declines unless everything else is
                   changed in line.

                        Summary
                        • This chapter introduces organisational structure and systems as key factors in strategy
                          implementation.
                        • There are five main structural types (e.g. functional, divisional, matrix, transnational and
                          project). Each structural type has its own strengths and weaknesses and fits differently the
                          challenges of diversification, innovation and internationalisation.
                        • There is a range of different organisational systems to facilitate and control strategy. These
                          systems can focus on either inputs or outputs and be direct or indirect.
                        • Organisational structures and systems influence strategic agility and resilience.
                        • The separate organisational elements should come together to form a coherent reinforcing
                          configuration, summarised in the McKinsey 7-S framework.

                        14.2      Referring to Section 14.2.2 on the divisional structure, consider the advantages
                                  and disadvantages of creating divisions along different lines – such as product,
                                  geography or technology – with respect to a large organisation you are familiar
                                  with or a case organisation such as CRH* or Siemens*.

                                  stances or corporate organisation would this style not work so well for you?

                        Integrative assignment
                        14.5      Take a recent merger or acquisition (see Chapter 11), ideally one involving two
                                  organisations of roughly equal size, and analyse how the deal has changed the
                                  acquiring or merged company’s organisational structure. What do you conclude
                                  from the extent or lack of structural change for the new company going forward?

15.1 Introduction
          Amazon, the internet retailer, has been led by founder Jeff Bezos for a quarter of a century.
          Bezos lays down ‘Fifteen Leadership Principles’ for the 630,000 people who work for his
          company around the world. According to these principles, Amazonians should ‘Think Big’,
          ‘Dive Deep’, follow a ‘Bias for Action’ and ‘Have Backbone’. Such principles have helped
          Bezos lead Amazon’s massive strategic change from online bookstore to diversified tech-
          nology giant, with interests ranging from cloud infrastructure for business to mobile
          phones.
              The theme of strategic change runs through much of this book. Part I of this book examined
          pressures for strategic change arising from the organisation’s environment and its internal
          position; Part II looked at the kinds of strategic option that might form part of strategic
          change, such as diversification, internationalisation or innovation. However, central to stra-
          tegic change is the leadership task of ensuring that people deliver whatever strategic options
          are finally chosen. While this leadership role is most often associated with chief executives
          it may, in fact, occur at different levels in organisations: other senior managers and middle
          managers often take leadership roles in change as well. Indeed, at Amazon, the company’s
          leadership principles are supposed to be followed by all.
              Figure 15.1 provides a structure for the chapter. The chapter opens (Section 15.2) by
          explaining different roles of leaders and different leadership styles. A key task of leadership
          is strategic change. Leaders need to address two issues in considering their approach to
          change. First, they have to understand the organisational context, the extent to which it is
          receptive or resistant to change: Section 15.3 particularly addresses the forces blocking or
          facilitating change. Second, leaders have to identify the type of strategic change required:
          Section 15.4 differentiates types of change according to speed and scope. Understanding the
          context, and identifying the required type of change, should help leaders select the appro-
          priate levers for change: Section 15.5 considers levers ranging from symbolic management
          to political action. Section 15.6 draws many of the issues together by considering common
          reasons for the failure of strategic change programmes and pointing to the importance of
          informal change.

15.2 Leadership and strategic change
                   Leadership is the process of influencing an organisation (or group within an organ-
                   isation) in its efforts towards achieving an aim or goal.1 Without effective leadership
                   the risk is that people in an organisation are unclear about its purpose or lack motivation
                   to deliver the strategy to achieve it. Leadership is associated particularly with strategic
                   change. For example, Harvard Business School’s John Kotter argues that ‘good manage-
                   ment’ is about bringing order and consistency to operational aspects of organisations,
                   such as quality and profitability of products and services. Leadership, ‘by contrast is about
                   coping with change’.2 Thus strategic change is a crucial underlying theme in this discussion
                   of leadership.


                   15.2.1 Strategic leadership roles
                   While leading strategic change is often associated with top management, and chief
                   executives in particular, in practice it typically involves managers at different levels in an
                   organisation.3

                   Top managers
                   There are three key roles that are especially significant for top management, especially CEOs,
                   in leading strategic change:

                   • Envisioning future strategy.4 Effective strategic leaders at the top of an organisation need
                     to ensure there exists a clear and compelling vision of the future and communicate clearly
                     a strategy to achieve it both internally and to external stakeholders. In the absence of their
                     doing so, those who attempt to lead change elsewhere in an organisation, for example
                     middle managers, are likely to construct such a vision themselves, leading to internal
                     incoherence.
                   • Aligning the organisation to deliver that strategy. This involves ensuring that people in
                     the organisation are committed to the strategy, motivated to make the changes needed
                     and empowered to deliver those changes. In doing so, there is a need for leaders to build
                     trust and respect across the organisation. It can, however, also be necessary to change the
                     management of the organisation to ensure such commitment, which is a reason why top
                     teams are often reshuffled at points of strategic change.
                   • Embodying change. A strategic leader will be seen by internal and external stakeholders
                     as intimately associated with a strategic change programme. A strategic leader is, then,
                     symbolically highly significant in the change process and needs to be a role model for
                     future strategy (see Section 15.4.5 below on symbolic levers for change).


                   Middle managers
                   A top-down approach to managing strategy and strategic change sees middle managers
                   as mere implementers of top management strategic plans. Here their role is to ensure that
                   resources are allocated and controlled appropriately and to monitor the performance and
                   behaviour of staff. However, middle managers have multiple roles in relation to strategy.5 In
                   the context of managing strategic change there are four roles to emphasise:

                   • Champions of strategic issues. Middle managers are often the closest to market or techno-
                     logical shifts that might signal the need for strategic change. They are also well-placed to

  be able to identify likely blockages to change. Accordingly, middle managers must gain
  the attention of senior management for strategic issues that are less visible to the top of
  the organisation, and win senior managers’ commitment to appropriate strategic actions.
  In other words, middle managers must often ‘sell’ strategic issues to top management,
  getting their buy-in in order to push strategy forward.
• ‘Sense makers’ of strategy. Top management may set a strategic direction, but how it is
  explained and made sense of in specific contexts (e.g. a region of a multinational or a
  functional department) may effectively be left to middle managers. If misinterpretation of
  that intended strategy is to be avoided, it is therefore vital that middle managers under-
  stand and feel an ownership of it. They are therefore a crucial relevance bridge between
  top management and members of the organisation at lower levels.6
• Adapters to unfolding events. Middle managers are uniquely qualified to reinterpret and
  adjust strategy because they have day-to-day responsibility for implementation.
• Local leaders. Middle managers symbolise and embody change, just like top management,
  but do so at a local level. This can be particularly important in decentralised organisations,
  such as chains of retail stores or multinational corporations.

Recognising the leadership role of middle managers can help balance the heroic, top-down
and individualist image often associated with leaders, particularly in Anglo-American busi-
ness cultures. Of course, middle managers can be heroic individuals. However, because they
do not have the power or legitimacy of top managers, middle managers are often obliged
to adopt more collective or collaborative approaches to leadership.7 Leaders may need to
harness the support and ideas of colleagues in teams. Many top managers also prefer this
collaborative approach. In other words, leaders are not always individualistic. There are
different styles of leadership.


15.2.2 Leadership styles
Leaders tend to adopt characteristic ‘styles’ of behaving and intervening. These leadership
styles are often categorised in two broad ways:

• Transformational (or charismatic) leaders emphasise building a vision for their organ-
  isations, creating an organisational identity around collective values and beliefs to
  support that vision and energising people to achieve it. Organisational founders are often
  particularly charismatic (i.e. personally inspiring). Evidence suggests that this approach to
  leadership is beneficial for people’s motivation and job performance,8 and is particularly
  positive for wider business performance when organisations face uncertainty.9
• Transactional leaders emphasise ‘hard’ levers of change such as designing systems and
  controls. The emphasis here is more likely to be on changes of structures, setting targets
  to be achieved, financial incentives, careful project management and the monitoring of
  organisational and individual performance.

In practice, transformational and transactional leadership styles are two ends of a continuum,
with many feasible points between. Leaders typically combine elements of the two styles,
rather than identifying exclusively with one (see Illustration 15.1). Indeed, the notion of
situational leadership encourages strategic leaders to adjust their leadership style
to the context they face.10 In other words, there is not just one best way of leading:
appropriate leadership style changes according to the specific demands of the situation.
The next two sections examine two aspects of such situations: contexts of change and types
of change.

15.3 Analysing the change context
          The effectiveness of different leadership styles is shaped by the organisational context in
          which change occurs.11 A small entrepreneurial business is a very different context to a large,
          bureaucratic organisation. The ‘change kaleidoscope’ and forcefield analysis are two ways
          of assessing organisational receptiveness to change. This will help in determining both the
          style of change and the types of change required.


          15.3.1 The change kaleidoscope
          Julia Balogun (University of Liverpool) and Veronica Hope-Hailey (University of Bath) propose
          the ‘change kaleidoscope’ (summarised in Figure 15.2) as a framework for identifying key
          contextual features to take into account when designing change programmes. Just as a toy
          kaleidoscope rearranges a set of elements into different patterns, the change kaleidoscope
          highlights how a set of contextual features can take various forms supporting or resisting
          change. Figure 15.2 identifies eight contextual features:

          • The time available for change can differ dramatically. A business may face immediate
            decline in turnover or profits from rapid changes in its markets. This is a quite different
            context for change compared with a business where the management may see the need
            for change as years away and have time to plan it carefully.12
          • The scope of change might differ in terms of either the breadth of change across an
            organisation or the depth of culture change required. For example, a global business

                      with multiple brands is likely to involve a high breadth of change, while an established
                      organisation with a long cultural heritage is likely to demand depth of change.
                   • Preservation of some aspects of an organisation may be needed. For example, some
                     capabilities may need to be built upon in order to achieve change, while others can simply
                     be abandoned. Alternatively, some established parts of the organisation may need to
                     be retained in order to generate revenues, while waiting for newer parts to build up
                     strength and economic effectiveness. This combination of preservation and change relates
                     to the notion of organisational ambidexterity (Section 15.4) and historical continuity
                     (Section 6.2).
                   • Diversity in experience, views and opinions within an organisation may help the change
                     process, providing the seeds from which new initiatives can grow. However, if an organ-
                     isation has followed a strategy for many decades, such continuity may have led to a very
                     homogeneous way of seeing the world, which could hamper change.
                   • Capacity for change in terms of available resources will also be significant. Change can be
                     costly, not only in financial terms, but also in terms of management time. It is likely to be
                     the responsibility of top management (or perhaps owners) to provide such resources.
                   • Power is crucial to creating change. Often it is assumed that the chief executive has such
                     power, but in the face of resistance from below, or perhaps resistance from external stake-
                     holders, this may not be the case. It may also be that the chief executive supposes that
                     others in the organisation have the power to effect change when they do not, or do not
                     see themselves as having it. In organisations with hierarchical power structures a directive
                     style may be common and it may be difficult to break away from it, not least because
                     people expect it. On the other hand, in ‘flatter’ power structures, a more networked or
                     learning organisation described elsewhere in this text (see Section 12.3.1), it is likely that
                     collaboration and participation will be common, indeed desirable.
                   • Capability at managing change is important for effective change. Change is complex
                     to manage, so larger organisations especially need to have access to skilled and expe-
                     rienced change managers, whether in the form of in-house organisation development
                     professionals or external consultants. It helps too if there is a workforce experienced with
                     change, rather than being set in its ways.
                   • The readiness for change is the final factor to take into account. Is there a felt need for
                     change across the organisation, widespread resistance, or pockets of resistance in some
                     parts of the organisation and readiness in others?

                      As in the notion of situational leadership (Section 15.2), the appropriate leadership style
                   will vary according to the contextual factors illuminated by the change kaleidoscope. Time
                   pressure, limited managerial capabilities and low readiness to change might all encourage a
                   transactional style, for instance: fast, authoritarian change can largely be managed by hard
                   mechanisms like controls and incentives. However, the eight factors of the kaleidoscope are
                   rarely perfectly aligned. Sometimes the readiness for change is suitably high, and the scope of
                   change is sufficiently broad, for a leader to adopt a transformational approach, but the time
                   pressure is too great to allow for the typically slow process of creating a new, collective vision.
                   Change leaders need to determine which of the eight factors of the change kaleidoscope
                   matter most in particular circumstances, and accept that they may have to prioritise some
                   over others. Like a kaleidoscope, factors can shift and rarely perfectly align. Thus the change
                   kaleidoscope encourages a multidimensional analysis of change context, and recognises the
                   need for trade-offs between factors. The role of kaleidoscope factors in defining appropriate
                   leadership styles is shown in Illustration 15.2, on Indian banking.
                      To illustrate further how leadership style can be situational, Figure 15.3 highlights just two
                   of the eight kaleidoscope factors: i. managerial capability and ii. the readiness of employees

to change. Taking these two contextual features alone, Figure 15.3 suggests that, where
there is both low readiness and low capability for change, a transactional leadership style
may be appropriate. Here leaders may lack the capabilities for transformational vision-
building and instead make use of the available hard levers of incentives and controls. In other
words, they will rely heavily on the top-down direction of employees. On the other hand,
where there is high readiness and high capability, a transformational leadership style may
work well (time pressures allowing, of course). Here leaders will be collaborative, emphasising
employee consultation, team-work and buy-in. Where capability is high, but readiness is low,
persuasion will be the dominant task. This often implies a transformational leadership style,
building collective vision and shared energy, but it could be more transactional, involving
the provision of financial incentives for example. Where readiness is high, but capability
is low, change will often involve coaching, with a great deal of education and training at
management level especially. A visionary transformational leader can often be helpful here,
particularly if the scope of change is broad.


15.3.2 Forcefield analysis
A second means of approaching the context for change is analysing the balance of forces
supporting or resisting change. A forcefield analysis compares the forces at work in an
organisation acting either to block or to facilitate change. Thus forcefield analysis involves
identifying those who favour change, those who oppose it and those are more or less neutral.
Identifying allies and opponents (actual or potential) helps in the politics of strategic change.
The task is to persuade those who are neutral or even against change to move into the camp
of those who favour it. The relative weight of the forces finally favouring or opposing change
helps also in estimating the effort required to achieve change. The more forces are arrayed
against change, the more effort is needed.
   Forcefield analysis helps ask some further key questions:

• What aspects of the current situation would block change, and how can these blocks be
  overcome?
• What aspects of the current situation might facilitate change in the desired direction, and
  how might these be reinforced?
• What needs to be introduced or developed to add to the forces for change?

                                                                                             471

          A forcefield analysis can be informed by the change kaleidoscope but also by other concepts
          and frameworks in the text:

          • Stakeholder mapping (Section 4.5.2) can provide insight into the power of different stake-
            holders to promote change or to resist change.
          • The culture web (Section 5.3.6). Strategic change often goes hand-in-hand with a perceived
            need to change the culture of the organisation. The culture web is a means of diagnosing
            organisational culture: it can provide an understanding of the symbolic, routinised as well
            as structural and systemic factors that may be taken for granted and can act for or against
            change. It can also be used to envisage what the culture of an organisation would need
            to look like to deliver future strategy.
          • The 7-S framework (Section 13.4.1) can highlight aspects of the infrastructure of an organ-
            isation that may act to promote or block change.

            As well as helping to identify the current forces acting for and against change, each of
          these frameworks can also be used to help think through what else might be needed as
          additional forces to promote change.



15.4 Types of strategic change
          Julia Balogun and Veronica Hope Hailey13 identify four generic types of strategic change. The
          axes in Figure 15.4 are concerned with (i) the extent of change, in other words the desired
          end-result and (ii) the nature of the change process, particularly the speed. These two axes
          relate to the time and scope features of the change kaleidoscope (Figure 15.2).
             In terms of the extent of change, change that occurs in line with the current business
          model and culture is considered a realignment of strategy. A business may launch new
          products without requiring fundamental changes in the business model or organisational
          culture. More extensive change, going beyond the current business model or culture, is
          transformational change (this does not necessarily imply transformational leadership).
          Many of the tools of analysis in Part I of the text can help identify the extent of change
          required. For example, does the change require a substantial reconfiguration of the value
          chain (Section 4.4.2), significant changes in the activities underpinning strategic capabilities
          (Section 4.4.3) or major cultural change (Section 6.4.6)? Some changes in strategy may have
          much wider ramifications than initially might appear. For example, digital transformation
          typically implies not just the introduction of new information technology and distribution
          channels, but deep changes in culture and skills (see Illustration 15.3 on la Redoute’s digital
          transformation).14
             On the other axis in Figure 15.4, the nature of change is concerned with the speed at
          which change needs to happen. Arguably, it is often beneficial for change in an organisation
          to be incremental since this allows time to build on the skills, routines and beliefs of those
          in the organisation. It also allows for learning as the change proceeds, allowing for adjust-
          ments to be made in the light of experience. However, if an organisation faces crisis or needs
          to change direction fast, a rapid (or ‘big bang’) approach to change might be needed: here
          everything is attempted all at once.
             Together, Figure 15.4’s two axes of extent of change and speed of change define four
          basic types of strategic change, as follows.

15.4.1 Adaptation
As explained Chapter 5.4.1 and Chapter 12.3, strategy development is often incremental in
nature. It builds on, rather than fundamentally changes, prior strategy. It is what Figure 15.4
refers to as adaptation. Change is gradual, building on or amending what the organisation has
been doing in the past and in line with the current business model and organisational culture.
This might include changes in product design or methods of production, launches of new
products or related diversification. This is the most common form of change in organisations.


15.4.2 Reconstruction (turnaround)
Reconstruction is rapid change involving a good deal of upheaval in an organisation, but
which still does not fundamentally change the culture or the business model. Another
common term for this is restructuring. Thus reconstruction might include changes in organisa-
tional structure, changes in the financial structure (reduction of debt for instance) or changes
in the cost structure of the business. For a diversified corporation, reconstruction could also
involve the acquisition or divestment of a business, something that might involve large assets
but which could still be compatible with the basic organisational structure and systems.
    The classic reconstruction/restructuring is a turnaround strategy in the face of radical
performance decline. Turnaround strategies emphasise rapidity in change, cost reduction
and/or revenue generation, with the aim of fast recovery. The priority in turnarounds
is actions that give rapid and significant improvements. Situations calling for turnarounds
include economic recessions, the failure of major investment projects or the sudden collapse
of important markets. Turnaround actions go beyond simple cost-cutting. Five key elements
of turnaround strategies are:15

• Crisis stabilisation. The aim is to regain control over the deteriorating position. This requires
  a short-term focus on cost reduction and/or revenue increase, typically involving some of
  the steps identified in Table 15.1. There is nothing novel about these steps: many of them
  are good management practice. The differences are the speed at which they are carried out
  and the focus of managerial attention on them. The most successful turnaround strategies

                      just cuts to apparent overhead costs, such as research and development or marketing spend.
                   • Management changes. Changes in management may be required, especially at the top. This
                     usually includes the introduction of a new chairman or chief executive, as well as changes to
                     the board, especially in marketing, sales and finance, for three main reasons. First, because the
                     old management may well be the ones that were in charge when the problems developed
                     and be seen as the cause of them by key stakeholders. Second, because it may be necessary
                     to bring in management with experience of turnaround management. Third, management
                     changes provide the opportunity to bring in new skills and approaches from outside the
                     organisation, different to the old skills and approaches that had led to the original crisis.
                   • Gaining stakeholder support. Poor quality of information may have been provided to key
                     stakeholders. In a turnaround situation it is vital that key stakeholders, perhaps the bank or key
                     shareholder groups, and employees are kept clearly informed of the situation and improve-
                     ments as they are being made. It is also likely that a clear assessment of the power of different
                     stakeholder groups (see Section 5.5.1) will become vitally important in managing turnaround.
                   • Clarifying the target market(s) and core products. Central to turnaround success is
                     ensuring clarity on the target market or market segments most likely to generate cash
                     and grow profits. A successful turnaround strategy involves getting closer to customers
                     and improving the flow of marketing information, especially to senior levels of manage-
                     ment, so as to focus revenue-generating activities on key market segments. Of course, a
                     reason for the poor performance of the organisation could be that it had this wrong in
                     the first place. Clarifying the target market also provides the opportunity to discontinue
                     or outsource products and services that are not targeted on those markets, eating up
                     management time for little return or not making sufficient financial contribution.
                   • Financial restructuring. The financial structure of the organisation may need to be
                     changed. This typically involves changing the existing capital structure, raising additional
                     finance or renegotiating agreements with creditors, especially banks. Reducing debt will
                     increase an organisation’s robustness in the face of future crises.



                   15.4.3 Revolution
                   Revolution is change that requires rapid and major strategic and cultural change. Revolution could
                   be pursued in circumstances where the strategy has been so bounded by the existing culture
                   that, even when environmental or competitive pressures might require fundamental change, the
                   organisation has failed to respond. This might have occurred over many years (see the discussion

476
                                                                   15.4 Types of strategic change


of strategic drift in Section 6.4) and resulted in circumstances where pressures for change are
extreme – for example, when a takeover threatens the continued existence of a firm.
   Revolutionary change therefore differs from turnaround (or reconstruction) in the need
for deep cultural change. Leading change in such circumstances is likely to involve:

• Clear strategic direction. The need to give a clear strategic direction and to undertake
  decisive action in line with that direction is critical. This may of course include some of
  the decisions outlined above for turnaround: for example, portfolio changes and greater
  market focus. This is the type of change where individual CEOs who are seen to provide
  such direction are often credited with making a major difference. They may well also
  become the symbol of such change within an organisation and externally.
• Top management changes. The replacement of the CEO, senior executives or, perhaps,
  changes in board membership is common in revolutionary change. However, compared
  to turnarounds, the new top management is intended to bring cultural change as much
  as new skills and perspectives.16 The introduction of new top management also signals
  the significance of change internally and externally.
• Culture change. This is a greater explicit focus than in a simple reconstruction/turnaround.
  Nonetheless, it may be possible to work with elements of the existing culture. It will be
  important to identify those aspects of culture that can be built upon and developed and
  those that have to be changed – ‘preserved’, in terms of the change kaleidoscope (see
  Section 15.3.1). Although revolutionary change is urgent, some cultural change may take
  longer to bed down than other changes.


15.4.4 Evolution
Evolution is change in strategy that results in transformation, but gradually. Arguably this is
the most challenging type of strategic change since it is typically not motivated by a crisis. As
Chapter 6 explains, many successful organisations are liable to stick to historic bases of success,
with limited exploration of new ways of doing things. The evolutionary challenge is often of
maintaining a successful business model and culture (see Chapter 7) while exploring new
options in a changing environment. One approach is to cultivate organisational ambidexterity.
    Human ambidexterity is the ability to use both hands equally well. Organisational ambi-
dexterity is the capacity both to exploit existing capabilities and to explore for new
capabilities. It is, of course, appropriate and necessary that an organisation should seek
to exploit the capabilities it has built up over time in order to achieve and sustain compet-
itive advantage. However, exploitation will tend to allow only incremental change, since
strategy is being built on established ways of doing things. If transformational change is to
be achieved, there needs also to be exploration in order to innovate and build new capabil-
ities. This is in line with the lesson from Section 4.2.2 that organisations need the ability to
renew and re-create their capabilities; they need to develop dynamic capabilities.
    However, organisational ambidexterity can be challenging because the different processes
associated with exploitation and exploration raise contradictory pressures: ambidex-
terity involves being both focused and flexible, efficient yet innovative, looking forward and
looking backward.17 Four kinds of approach can help manage the pressures of ambidexterity:

• Structural ambidexterity. Organisations may maintain the main core of the business
  devoted to exploitation with tighter control and careful planning but create separate
  units or temporary, perhaps project-based, teams for exploration (see Section 13.2.5).
  These exploratory units will be smaller in size, less tightly controlled with much more
  emphasis on learning and processes to encourage new ideas.18 As in Illustration 14.2,

                      the separate Ventures and X subsidiaries.
                   • Diversity rather than conformity. Maintaining a diversity of views within the organisation can help
                     promote ambidexterity, in line with the concept of organisational learning (see Section 12.3.1).
                     Such diversity might be based on managers with different experience or different views on
                     future strategy, giving rise to useful debate. Such contesting of strategy may come to be
                     ‘normal’ at senior levels in an organisation.19 Stanford University’s Robert Burgelman20 also
                     argues that diverse views can be found close to the market and therefore perhaps at junior
                     levels in an organisation; senior executives need to channel this market or junior-level ‘disson-
                     ance’ into a ‘searing intellectual debate’ until a clearer strategic pattern emerges.
                   • The role of leadership. In turn this has implications for leadership roles in organisations.
                     Leaders need to encourage and value different views and potentially contradictory
                     behaviours rather than demanding uniformity.21 This may mean running with new ideas
                     and experiments to establish just what makes sense and what does not. However, they
                     also need to have the authority, legitimacy and recognition to stop such experiments
                     when it becomes clear that they are not worthwhile pursuing and make decisions about
                     the direction that is to be followed, which, once taken, are followed by everyone in the
                     organisation – including those who have previously dissented.
                   • Tight and loose systems. All this suggests that there needs to be a balance between ‘tight’
                     systems of strategy development that can exploit existing capabilities – perhaps employing
                     the disciplines of strategic planning – and ‘looser’ systems that encourage new ideas and
                     experimentation. This combination of loose and tight systems can be given coherence
                     so long as there is some overall common ‘glue’, perhaps in the form of an organisational
                     mission or vision that allows different units to express the organisation’s overall purpose
                     in different ways.

                   Identifying the type of strategic change in hand will assist in selecting the detailed levers for
                   change to be considered in Section 15.5. Meanwhile, following the logic of situational lead-
                   ership, it should be noted that appropriate leadership styles are likely to vary according to
                   the types of change being sought. Urgent and limited change – especially the kind of recon-
                   struction associated with turnaround – tend to require more emphasis on the transactional
                   approach, focused on short-term targets and tight monitoring of performance. Transform-
                   ational leadership styles are usually more important in broad and longer-term evolutionary
                   change, though they also play a role in the cultural elements of revolutionary change.
                       However, one challenge for leaders is that often one type of change leads to another
                   type of change, requiring different leadership styles. Sometimes this shift between types of
                   change can be managed in stages. For example, short-term turnaround can set the stage
                   for sustained evolutionary change, obliging leaders to transition from a transactional style
                   to a more transformational style. Sometimes, small-scale changes can actually destabilise
                   organisations, leading to larger-scale changes whether or not originally planned or required.
                   It is because changes are not necessarily discrete stand-alone alternatives that Balogun and
                   Hope-Hailey refer to types of change as ‘paths’, underlining how changes of one kind are
                   liable to lead to more changes of a different kind.22



15.5 Levers for strategic change
                   Having identified both the type of change required and the receptiveness of the context,
                   change leaders must choose between the various levers (or means) for change. Most
                   successful change initiatives rely on multiple levers.23

Adapted from Kotter J. (1996), ‘Leading change: why transformation efforts fail’, Harvard Business Review, March–April, p. 61.



   Sometimes these levers are presented as a sequence, as for example in Harvard Business
School professor John Kotter’s Eight Steps for Change (Figure 15.5).24 Here the process of
change is described as a series of steps, starting from establishing a sense of urgency in the
organisation, leading eventually to the institutionalisation of change. These steps provide
leaders with a clear progression in the managing of change. However, in practice, many of
these levers are likely to be used simultaneously rather than in the kind of logical sequence
in Figure 15.5. There are also other levers that can be drawn upon. Some levers for change
have already been discussed elsewhere in the text. The importance of strategic vision (a
major feature of Figure 15.5) was discussed in Section 5.2 together with the importance of
other goals and objectives. The consolidating and institutionalising of change involves the
kinds of adjustments of organisational structures and systems described in Chapter 13. This
section focuses on seven further levers of change.


15.5.1 A compelling case for change
A starting point must be presenting a convincing case for change. This equates to Kotter’s
first step, establishing a sense of urgency. However, McKinsey & Co, the consultants,25 warn
that too often the case for change is made in terms of top management’s perception of
what is important: for example, meeting expectations of shareholders or beating competi-
tion. When most managers and employees are asked, however, there are many more factors
that motivate them: for example, the impact on society, on customers, on the local working
team, or on employees’ personal well-being. In making the case for change, transform-
ational leaders especially need to speak to these different bases of motivation, not just to
top management perceptions of why change is needed. It may, of course, be difficult for
top management to understand and relate to these different needs. In this case, it may
make sense to involve employees themselves in the creation of stories of change that, in
effect, ‘translate’ corporate imperatives of change into local motivating messages. It is also
important that the case for change does not just focus on the understanding of why change
is needed, but the action required to deliver it.


15.5.2 Challenging the taken for granted
Often another early key step in managing strategic change is challenging what can be long-
standing mindsets or taken-for-granted assumptions – the organisational paradigm, in the
terms of Chapter 6. There are different approaches to challenging the paradigm. One view is

                                                                                                                         479
Chapter 15 Leadership and strategic change


                   that gathering enough objective evidence, perhaps in the form of careful strategic analysis,
                   will be enough to challenge and therefore change the paradigm. However, assumptions
                   can be very resistant to change: people find ways of questioning, reconfiguring and reinter-
                   preting objective analyses in order to bring it in line with the existing paradigm. It may take
                   much persistence to overcome this. Another view is that encouraging people to question
                   and challenge each other’s assumptions and received wisdom by making them explicit is
                   valuable.26 Scenario planning (see Section 2.2.2) is one way of getting people to see possible
                   different futures and the implications for their organisations. Firms that are good at change
                   often have questioning and ‘contestation’ embedded within their cultures: this, for example,
                   has been the case for the French cosmetics firm L’Oréal, where they actually have a presen-
                   tation theatre called the ‘contestation room’ (salle de contestation).27


                   15.5.3 Changing operational processes and routines
                   Another lever for strategic change is to start at the bottom, with the basic day-to-day
                   processes and routines of the organisation’s operations. These processes and routines might
                   be formalised and codified or they might be less formal ‘ways we do things around here’. The
                   ways in which colleagues simply communicate with each other, or interact with customers,
                   or respond to mistakes can all be serious blockages to change. The relationship between
                   strategic change and day-to-day processes and routines is therefore important to consider
                   in at least three respects:

                   • Planning operational change. The planning of the implementation of an intended strategy
                     requires the identification of the key changes in the routines required to deliver that
                     strategy. In effect, strategic change needs to be considered in terms of the re-engineering
                     of organisational processes.
                   • Challenging operational assumptions. Changing organisational processes and routines
                     may also have the effect of challenging the often taken-for-granted assumptions under-
                     pinning them. In turn this may have the effect of getting people to question and challenge
                     deep-rooted beliefs and assumptions in the organisation. Richard Pascale argues: ‘It is
                     easier to act your way into a better way of thinking than to think your way into a better
                     way of acting’;28 in other words, it is easier to change behaviour and by so doing change
                     taken-for-granted assumptions than to try to change taken-for-granted assumptions as a
                     way of changing behaviour. If this is so, the style of change employed (see Section 15.2.2
                     above) needs to take this into account: it suggests that attempting to persuade people
                     to change may be less powerful than involving people in the activities of changing.
                   • Bottom-up changes to routines. Even when changes in routines are not planned from the
                     top, people do change them and this may result in wider strategic change. This may occur
                     through trial and error learning as people experiment with different routines associated
                     with doing their jobs.29 Or it could occur as people learn from and adapt the routines in
                     other organisations.30 Or it may occur more proactively by managers deliberately and
                     persistently ‘bending the rules of the game’ till they achieve enough support from different
                     stakeholders such that new routines supporting a shift in strategy become acceptable.31

                     The overall lesson is that changes in routines may appear to be mundane, but they can
                   have significant impact.


                   15.5.4 Symbolic management32
                   Change levers are not always of an overt, formal nature: they may also be symbolic in nature.
                   Symbols may be everyday things which are nevertheless especially meaningful in the context

of a particular situation or organisation. Changing symbols can help reshape beliefs and
expectations because meaning becomes apparent in the day-to-day experiences people have
of organisations, such as the symbols that surround them (e.g. office layout and décor), the
type of language and technology used and organisational rituals. Consider some examples:

• Many rituals33 of organisations are concerned with effecting or consolidating change.
  Table 15.3 identifies and gives examples of such rituals and suggests what role they might
  play in change processes. New rituals can be introduced or old rituals done away with as
  ways of signalling or reinforcing change.
• Changes in physical aspects of the work environment are powerful symbols of change.
  Typical here is a change of location for the head office, relocation of personnel, changes
  in dress or uniforms, and alterations to offices or office space.
• The behaviour of managers, particularly strategic leaders, is perhaps the most powerful
  symbol in relation to change. So, having made pronouncements about the need for
  change, it is vital that the visible behaviour of change agents be in line with such change.
• The language used by change agents is also important.34 Either consciously or uncon-
  sciously language and metaphor may be employed to galvanise change. Of course, there
  is also the danger that strategic leaders do not realise the significance of their language
  and, while espousing change, use language that signals adherence to the status quo, or
  personal reluctance to change.

  However, there is an important qualification to the idea that the manipulation of symbols
can be a useful lever for managing change. The significance and meaning of symbols are
dependent on how they are interpreted. Since they may not be interpreted as intended, their
impact is difficult to predict.


15.5.5 Power and political systems
Section 5.5 explained the importance of understanding the political context in and around
an organisation. Strategic change particularly can be a political process. Illustration 15.4 also
gives examples of political processes. To effect change powerful support may be required
from individuals or groups or a reconfiguration of power structures may be necessary,

                     especially if transformational change is required. This is equivalent to Kotter’s second step
                     in the change process (Figure 15.5), forming a powerful guiding coalition. Table 15.3 shows
                     some of the mechanisms associated with managing change from a political perspective:35

                     • Controlling or acquiring resources, being identified with important resource areas or areas
                       of expertise. Such resources might include for example funds, information, key organ-
                       isational processes or key people. In particular the ability to withdraw or allocate such
                       resources can be a powerful tool in overcoming resistance, persuading others to accept
                       change or build readiness for change.
                     • Association with powerful stakeholder groups (or elites), or their supporters, can help build
                       a power base or help overcome resistance to change. Or a manager facing resistance to
                       change may seek out and win over someone highly respected from within the very group
                       resistant to change. It may also be necessary to remove individuals or groups resistant to
                       change. Who these are can vary – from powerful individuals in senior positions to whole
                       layers of resistance, perhaps executives in a threatened function or service.
                     • Building alliances and networks of contacts and sympathisers may be important in over-
                       coming the resistance of more powerful groups. Attempting to convert the whole organisa-
                       tion to an acceptance of change is difficult. There may, however, be parts of the organisation,
                       or individuals, more sympathetic to change than others with whom support for change can
                       be built. Marginalisation of those resistant to change may also be possible. However, the
                       danger is that powerful groups in the organisation may regard the building of support coali-
                       tions, or acts of marginalisation, as a threat to their own power, leading to further resistance
                       to change. An analysis of power and interest using the stakeholder mapping (Section 5.5.1)
                       can, therefore, be useful to identify bases of alliance and likely resistance.

                        However, the political aspects of change management are potentially hazardous.
                     Table 15.3 also summarises some of the problems. In overcoming resistance, the major
                     problem may simply be the lack of power to undertake such activity. Trying to break down
                     the status quo may become so destructive and take so long that the organisation cannot
                     recover from it. If the process needs to take place, its replacement by some new set of beliefs
                     and the implementation of a new strategy is vital and needs to be speedy. Further, as already

                   identified, in implementing change, gaining the commitment of a few senior executives at
                   the top of an organisation is one thing; it is quite another to convert the body of the organ-
                   isation to an acceptance of significant change.


                   15.5.6 Timing
                   How much time is available for strategic change has already been considered as part of the
                   change kaleidoscope (Section 15.3.1). However, choosing the precise time at which to launch
                   strategic change is another variable. The timing of change is often neglected. Choosing the
                   right time can be tactically vital. For example:

                   • Building on actual or perceived crisis is especially useful the greater the degree of change
                     needed. If there is a higher perceived risk in maintaining the status quo than in changing
                     it, people are more likely to change. Change leaders may take advantages of performance
                     downturns, competitive threats or threatened takeover as catalysts for strategic change.
                   • Windows of opportunity in change processes may exist. The arrival of a new chief executive,
                     the introduction of a new, highly successful product, or the arrival of a major competitive
                     threat on the scene may provide opportunities to make more significant changes than might
                     normally be possible. Since change will be regarded nervously, it may also be important to
                     choose the time for promoting such change to avoid unnecessary fear and nervousness.
                     For example, if there is a need for the removal of executives, this may be best done before
                     rather than during the change programme. In such a way, the change programme can be
                     seen as a potential improvement for the future rather than as the cause of such losses.
                   • The symbolic signalling of time frames may be important. In particular, conflicting
                     messages about the timing of change should be avoided. For example, if rapid change is
                     required, the maintenance of procedures or focus on issues that signal long time horizons
                     may be counter-productive.

                   However, it is important to recognise that top management is often not in control of timing.
                   Change is often mandated, imposed by government regulations or powerful stakeholders
                   for instance.36 It may still be important to set up formal change programmes in response to
                   such mandated changes, but here one lever is not under management control.


                   15.5.7 Visible short-term wins
                   A strategic change programme will require many detailed actions and tasks. It is important
                   that some are seen to be successful quickly. In Kotter’s model of change (Figure 15.5), creating
                   short-term wins is the sixth step. Useful is to pick some ‘low-hanging fruit’ – changes that
                   may not be big but can be made easily and yield a quick payoff. This could take the form, for
                   example, of a retail chain introducing a new product range and demonstrating its success in the
                   market or the breaking down of a long-established routine and the demonstration of a better
                   way of doing things. In themselves, these may not be especially significant aspects of a new
                   strategy, but they may be visible indicators of a new approach associated with that strategy.
                   The demonstration of such wins can therefore galvanise commitment to the wider strategy.
                      One reason given for the inability to change is that resources are not available to do so.
                   This may be overcome if it is possible to identify ‘hot spots’ on which to focus resources and
                   effort. For example, William Bratton, famously responsible for the Zero Tolerance policy of
                   the New York Police Department, began by focusing resource and effort on narcotics-related
                   crimes. Though associated with 50–70 per cent of all crimes he found they only had 5 per
                   cent of the resources allocated by NYPD to tackle them. Success in this field led to the roll-out
                   of his policies into other areas and to gaining the resources to do so.

            In sum, there are many kinds of change lever available. Which levers are most appropriate
         depend on the type of change being sought and the context in which it is being carried out.
         Similarly, leadership style needs to be consistent. For example, political approaches are asso-
         ciated with a more transactional leadership style and are more likely to work in unreceptive
         contexts seeking limited types of change. On the other hand, symbolic management and
         transformational leadership styles are particularly important when seeking evolutionary or
         revolutionary change in receptive contexts.


15.6 Problems of formal change programmes
         Strategic change is often launched as a top down initiative supported by formal methods
         of programme and project management. Kotter’s Eight Steps for Change (Figure 15.5), with
         its clear and logical sequence, can lend itself to this kind of deliberate, top-down approach.
         However, there are two limitations with regard to this formal programmatic approach.
         First, problems can arise from the process itself. Second, managers may mistake the relative
         importance of formal and informal change.
             First, formal change processes are liable to four particularly common problems, as follows:37

         • Death by planning. The emphasis is put on planning the change programme rather than
           delivering it. Subcommittees, project teams and working groups become bogged down
           in analyses, plans and proposals. The result can be ‘analysis paralysis’.
         • Organisational exhaustion. Change is often not a one-off process; it might require an
           ongoing series of initiatives, maybe over years. However, continuous change is exhausting
           for managers and employees. ‘Change fatigue’ can easily set in.
         • Behavioural compliance. This is where organisation members comply with the changes
           being pursued in the change programme without actually ‘buying into’ them. Employees
           follow the letter of the law, rather than its spirit. Because employees do not believe in the
           desired change, they cynically behave according to the new rules even when the spirit of
           the change requires something more.
         • Misreading scrutiny and resistance. Change leaders overreact to either resistance to the
           change or critical scrutiny of it. Often this behaviour is seen as negative and destructive.
           However, scrutiny and resistance can be ways in which ‘change recipients’ begin to engage
           with what the changes mean for them. Scrutiny is part of the acceptance process, and may
           throw up legitimate issues besides. Explicit resistance is more easy to address than that
           which is passive or covert (i.e. behavioural compliance). So managers should see scrutiny
           and resistance as potential positives rather than only negatives.

            Not only can formal change programmes fail, but managers often do not recognise how
         informal changes are always happening anyway. According to Hari Tsoukas and Robert Chia,
         from the Universities of Warwick and Glasgow respectively, a lot of change happens regard-
         less of formal programmes.38 They argue that change is an inherent property of organisa-
         tions, as employees continually adapt and learn in response to changing conditions on the
         ground. Managers are liable not to recognise this inherent, unmanaged change. Indeed,
         hierarchy and management control often dampen such change. Thus managers under-
         estimate spontaneous, emergent change, while overestimating formal change programmes.
            The implication is that top-down planned change programmes can actually get in the
         way of the local informal adaptations that can be more effective because they are closer to
         market needs. It is important to remember that strategic change can bubble up from the
         bottom of the organisation. In this view, management’s job is to encourage and multiply
         successful local adaptations, not just impose strategic change from the top.

                                                                                                      485

                       Summary
                       A recurrent theme in this chapter has been that styles and levers of change need to be tailored
                       to the nature of that change. Bearing in mind this general point, this chapter has emphasised
                       the following:
                       • There are two main types of leadership style, transactional and transformational. Situational
                         leadership suggests that leaders need to adapt their styles according to different types and
                         contexts of change.
                       • The context for change can be analysed in terms of the change kaleidoscope and forcefield
                         analysis.
                       • The types of strategic change can be thought of in terms of the extent of change required
                         and its speed – whether it can be achieved through incremental change or requires rapid
                         action.
                       • Levers for managing strategic change include building a compelling case for change,
                         challenging the taken for granted, changing operational processes, routines and symbols,
                         political processes, timing and quick wins.

                            and how.
                       15.4✱ There are a number of books by (or about) renowned senior executives who have
                             led major changes in their organisation (for example, Karren Brady, Alex Ferguson,
                             Elon Musk). Read one of these and note the levers and mechanisms for change they
                             employed, using the approaches outlined in this chapter as a checklist. How effective
                             do you think these were in the context that the change leader faced, and could other
                             mechanisms have been used?

                       15.5✱ What would be the key issues for the corporate parent of a diversified organisation
                             with a multi-domestic international strategy (see Chapter 9) wishing to change to
                             a more related portfolio? Consider this in terms of (a) the strategic capabilities that
                             the parent might require (Chapters 4 and 8), (b) the implications for organising and
                             controlling its subsidiaries (Chapter 14), (c) the likely blockages to such change and
                             (d) how these might be overcome (Chapter 15).

16.1 Introduction
          After years of annual average sales increases of 15 per cent per annum, the world’s most
          profitable toy-maker Lego, experienced, in 2018, a sales decline of 8 per cent to £4.2bn and
          a profits fall of 17 per cent to £1.2bn. These were the first declines in 13 years. Explaining
          these results, retailers said they had too many Lego bricks in their shops which meant it was
          hard to get new products in front of customers, where newness counts, and Lego said it had
          produced so many bricks that it was then forced to sell them off cheaply to make room in its
          warehouses. Commentators remarked that Lego had become too big and too complex. Even
          so, it still came as a surprise at the end of 2017, the speed at which Lego suddenly replaced
          CEO, Bali Padda, after just eight months in the job. Lego now has a new Danish CEO who has
          started to make significant changes in order to reverse fortunes.
             If you were appointed CEO at Lego, or took on the role of its strategic planner or a strategy
          consultant, what would you do to develop and implement a strategy for its recovery? What
          specific actions would you take to manage competing pressures from a changing techno-
          logical environment and competitor actions. How would you handle political and social pres-
          sures from competing managers and investors? Formal strategy analysis is valuable here but
          what dynamic processes will make a difference to outcomes? This final chapter recognises
          that strategy is messy, complex, multi-layered and requires hard work. It is necessary there-
          fore to look at the actual practice of making strategy. Whereas Chapter 13 introduced the
          overall organisational process of strategy development, and showed this often does not
          follow a neat linear sequence, this chapter is about what people do inside the process. The
          aim is to examine the practicalities of strategy-making for top managers, strategic planning
          specialists, strategy consultants, managers and employees lower down the organisation.
             The chapter has three sections as shown in Figure 16.1:

          • The strategists. The chapter starts by looking at the various people involved in making
            strategy. It does not assume that strategy is made just by top management. As pointed
            out in Chapter 13, strategy often involves people from all over the organisation, and even
            people from outside. Readers can ask themselves how they fit into this set of strategists,
            now or in the future.

                    • Strategising activities. The chapter continues by considering the kinds of work and activity
                      that strategists carry out in their strategy-making. This includes not just the strategy
                      analysis that is an important part of this book, but also the selling of strategic issues,
                      the realities of strategic decision-making and the critical task of communicating strategic
                      decisions throughout the organisation and to external stakeholders.

                      workshops for formulating or communicating strategy; strategy projects and strategy
                      consulting teams; hypothesis testing to guide strategy work; and the creation of strategic
                      plans and business cases.

                       Figure 16.1 integrates these three sections in a pyramid of practice.1 The pyramid high-
                    lights three questions that run through this chapter: who to include in strategy-making; what
                    to do in carrying out strategising activity; and which strategising methodologies to use in
                    this strategising activity. Placing strategists at the top of the pyramid emphasises the role of
                    managerial discretion and skill in strategy-making. It is the strategists, who can be groups of
                    practitioners at different levels within an organisation and across organisational boundaries,
                    who drive both the strategising activity and the strategy methodologies that are at the base
                    of the pyramid. Strategists’ choices and skill with regard to activity and methodologies can
                    make a real difference to final outcomes. The rest of the chapter seeks to guide practising
                    strategists through the key choices they may have to make in action.



16.2 The strategists
                    This section introduces the different types of people potentially involved in strategy. It starts
                    at the top-management level, but also addresses strategic planners, consultants, investors
                    and middle managers. It might also extend to a much wider community. Therefore, one key
                    issue is who should be involved in strategy-making?


                    16.2.1 Top managers and directors
                    The conventional view is that strategy is the business of top management. In large organisa-
                    tions this view suggests that top management is clearly separated from operational respon-
                    sibilities, so that it can focus on overall strategy.2 If top managers are directly involved in
                    operations such as sales or service delivery, they are liable to get distracted from long-term
                    issues by day-to-day responsibilities and to represent the interests of their departments or
                    business units rather than the interests of their organisation as a whole. In the private sector
                    in large companies at least, top managers’ job titles underline this strategic responsibility:
                    company directors’ set direction, managers’ manage. For start-ups and SMEs, organisations
                    are not sufficiently large or developed for such clear separation and it is common for CEOs
                    to be directly in touch with the day-to-day business.
                       In most organisations, it is the board of directors (or their equivalents) who holds ultimate
                    responsibility for strategy (see Chapter 5). However, different roles are played by different board
                    members, whether chief executive officer, the top management team or non-executive directors:

                    • The chief executive officer (‘CEO’) is often seen as the ‘chief strategist’, ultimately respon-
                      sible for all strategic decisions. CEOs of large companies typically spend about one-third of
                      their time on strategy.3 Michael Porter stresses the value of a clear strategic leader, some-
                      body capable of setting a disciplined approach to what fits and what does not fit the overall
                      strategy.4 In this view, the CEO (or managing director or equivalent top individual) owns the

  strategy and is accountable for its success or failure. The clarity of this individual responsibility
  can no doubt focus attention. However, there are at least two dangers. First, centralising
  responsibility on the CEO can lead to excessive personalisation so that great organisational
  performance can be attributed entirely to a CEO without recognising the fundamental
  importance of other powerful supporting communities and sub structures.5 A consequence is
  that organisations then respond to setbacks simply by changing their CEO, rather than exam-
  ining deeply the internal sources of failure. Second, successful CEOs can become over-con-
  fident, seeing themselves as corporate heroes and launching strategic initiatives of ever-in-
  creasing ambition. The over-confidence, or hubris, of heroic leaders often leads to spectacular
  failures. Jim Collins’s research on ‘great’ American companies that outperformed their rivals
  over the long term found that their CEOs were typically modest, steady and long-serving.6
• The top management team, often an organisation’s executive directors, also shares
  responsibility for strategy. They can bring additional experience and insight to the CEO.
  In theory, they should be able to challenge the CEO and increase strategic debate. In
  practice, the top management team is often constrained in at least three ways. First,
  except in the larger companies where there may be senior strategy directors (sometimes
  called chief strategy officers (CSOs),7 top managers often carry operational responsibilities
  that either distract them or bias their strategic thinking: for example, in a business the
  marketing director will have ongoing concerns about marketing, the production director
  about production, and so on. In the public sector the top management team will also,
  very likely, be heads of operating departments. Second, top managers are also frequently
  appointed by the CEO; consequently, they may lack the independence for real challenge.
  Finally, top management teams, especially where their members have similar backgrounds
  and face strong leadership, often suffer from ‘groupthink’, the tendency to build strong
  consensus amongst team members and avoid internal questioning or conflict.8 This can
  be minimised by fostering diversity in membership (for example, differences in age, career
  tracks, nationality, gender and background), by ensuring openness to outside views, for
  example those of non-executive directors, and by promoting internal debate and ques-
  tioning. Organisations with cultures of internal ‘contestation’ seem to be more able to
  meet the challenge of strategic change over the long-run (see Illustration 16.5).9
• Non-executive directors have no executive management responsibility within the organ-
  isation, and so in theory should be able to offer an external and objective view on strategy.
  Although this varies according to national corporate governance systems (see Section 5.3.2),
  in a public company the chairman of the board is typically non-executive. The chairman will
  normally be consulted closely by the CEO on strategy, as he or she will have a key role in
  liaising with investors. However, the ability of the chairman and other non-executives to
  contribute substantially to strategy can be limited as they are often part-time appointments.
  Predominantly the non-executive directors’ role in strategy is consultative, reviewing and
  challenging strategy proposals that come from the top management executive team. They
  can be very valuable in providing knowledge and contacts about markets and business
  opportunities, institutional connections and independent thinking.10 They also have a key
  governance role to ensure that the organisation has a rigorous system in place for the making
  and renewing of strategy. It is therefore important non-executives are independent, author-
  itative and experienced individuals, and that they are fully briefed before board meetings.


16.2.2 Strategic planners
Strategic planners, sometimes known as strategy directors, strategy analysts or similar, are
those with a formal responsibility for coordinating the strategy process (see Chapter 13).
Although small companies very rarely have full-time strategic planners, they are common

                                                                                                  497
Chapter 16 The practice of strategy


                    in large companies and increasingly widespread in the public and not-for-profit sectors. As
                    in Illustration 16.1, organisations frequently advertise for strategic planning jobs. Here, the
                    personal specifications give a clear picture of the types of role a typical strategic planner
                    might be expected to play. In a large corporation the scope of a strategic planner’s job would
                    not only be working on a three-year strategic plan, but investigating acquisition targets,
                    monitoring competitors, helping business unit managers with their own plans, monitoring
                    implementations and directing strategic initiatives.11 Thus the role is not just about analysis
                    in the back office. It also involves communications, team-work and influencing skills.
                        Although the job in Illustration 16.1 is being advertised externally, strategic planners are
                    often drawn from inside their own organisations. Internal strategic planners are likely to
                    have an advantage in the important non-analytical parts of the job as they bring an under-
                    standing of the business, networks with key people in the organisation and credibility with
                    internal audiences. The role can serve as a developmental stage for managers on track for top
                    management positions as it gives them a view of the organisation as a whole and provides
                    exposure to senior management.
                        Strategic planners do not take strategic decisions themselves. However, they typically have
                    at least three important tasks:12

                    • Information and analysis. Strategic planners have the time, skills and resources to provide
                      information and analysis for key decision makers. This might be in response to some ‘trigger’
                      event – such as a possible merger – or as part of the regular planning cycle. Good informa-
                      tion and analysis can leave an organisation much better prepared to respond quickly and
                      confidently even to unexpected events. Strategic planners can also package this informa-
                      tion and analysis in formats that ensure clear communication of strategic decisions.
                    • Managers of the strategy process. Strategic planners can assist and guide other managers
                      through their strategic planning cycles (see Illustration 13.2 in Chapter 13). This can involve
                      acting as a bridge between the corporate centre and the businesses by clarifying corporate
                      expectations and guidelines. It could also involve helping business-level managers develop
                      strategy by providing templates, analytical techniques and strategy training. This bridging
                      role is important in achieving alignment of corporate-level and business-level strategies.
                      Researchers13 point out that this alignment is often lacking; many organisations do not
                      link financial budgets to strategic priorities, or employee performance metrics to strategy
                      implementation.
                    • Special projects. Strategic planners can be a useful resource to support top management
                      on special projects, such as acquisitions or organisational change. Here strategy planners
                      will typically work on project teams with middle managers from within the organisation
                      and often with external consultants. Project management skills are likely to be important.

                       In addition to these tasks, strategic planners typically work closely with the CEO, discussing
                    and helping refine his or her strategic thinking. Indeed, many strategic planners have their
                    offices physically located close to the CEO. Although strategic planners may have relatively
                    few resources – perhaps a small team of support staff – and little formal power, their close-
                    ness to the CEO typically makes them well-informed and influential. Managers throughout
                    an organisation are likely to use them to sound out ideas.


                    16.2.3 Middle managers
                    As in Section 16.2.1, a good deal of conventional management theory excludes middle
                    managers from strategy-making. Middle managers are seen as lacking an appropriately
                    objective and long-term perspective, being too involved in operations. In this view, middle
                    managers’ role is limited to strategy implementation. This is, of course, a vital role.

Chapter 16 The practice of strategy


                       However, there is a strong case for involving middle managers in strategy-making itself.
                    First, in fast-moving and competitive environments, organisations often need to decentralise
                    strategic responsibilities to increase speed of response: it takes too long to refer everything
                    to the top. Second, in knowledge-intensive sectors (such as design, consulting or finance,
                    but many others too) the key source of competitive advantage is typically the knowledge of
                    people actually involved in the operations of the business. Middle managers at operational
                    level can understand and influence these knowledge-based sources of competitive advan-
                    tage much more effectively than remote top managers. Many knowledge-intensive firms
                    (e.g. lawyers or accountants) are organised as partnerships, where a significant proportion
                    of staff have a right to consultation on strategic decisions in their formal role as partners,
                    even if they are not themselves members of the top management group.
                       Against this background, there are at least four strategy roles middle managers can play:14

                    • Information source. Middle managers’ knowledge and experience of the realities of the
                      organisation and its market is likely to be greater than that of many top managers. So
                      middle managers are a potential source of information about changes in the strategic
                      position of the organisation.
                    • ‘Sense making’ of strategy. Top management may set strategy, but it is often middle
                      managers who have to explain it in the business units.15 Middle managers are there-
                      fore a crucial relevance bridge between top management and members of the organisa-
                      tion at lower levels, in effect translating strategy into a message that is locally relevant.
                      If misinterpretation of that intended strategy is to be avoided, it is therefore vital that
                      middle managers understand and feel an ownership of it.
                    • Reinterpretation and adjustment of strategic responses as events unfold. A strategy may
                      be set at a certain point of time, but circumstances may change or conditions in partic-
                      ular units may differ from assumptions held by top management. Middle managers are
                      necessarily involved in strategy adaptation because of their day-to-day responsibilities in
                      strategy implementation.
                    • Champions of novel ideas and strategies. Given their closeness to markets and operations,
                      middle managers may not only provide information but champion new ideas that can be the
                      foundation of new strategies. Their links from deep within the organisation to the C-suite
                      allow them to translate and communicate new ideas that may initiate radical strategic change.

                       Middle managers may increase their influence on strategy when they have:

                    • Key organisational positions. Middle managers responsible for larger departments, busi-
                      ness units or strategically important parts of the organisation have influence because they
                      are likely to have critical knowledge, control substantial budgets and may be responsible
                      for large numbers of employees. Also, managers with outward-facing roles (for example,
                      in marketing) tend to have greater strategic influence than managers with inward-facing
                      roles (such as quality or operations).16
                    • Access to organisational networks. Middle managers may have little hierarchical power,
                      but can increase their influence by using their internal organisational networks. Infor-
                      mation from network members can help provide an integrated perspective on what is
                      happening in the organisation as a whole, something difficult to obtain in a specialised,
                      middle of organisation. Mobilising networks to raise issues and support proposals can give
                      more influence than any single middle manager can achieve on their own. Strategically
                      influential middle managers are therefore typically good networkers.
                    • Access to the organisation’s ‘strategic conversation’. Strategy-making does not just happen
                      in isolated, formal episodes, but is part of an ongoing strategic conversation among
                      respected managers. To participate in these strategic conversations middle managers

  should: maximise opportunities to mix formally and informally with top managers;
  become at ease with the particular language used to discuss strategy in their organisa-
  tion; familiarise themselves carefully with the key strategic issues; and develop their own
  personal contribution to these strategic issues.

   In the public sector elected politicians have traditionally been responsible for policy
and the public officials supposed to do the implementation. However, three trends are
challenging this division of roles.17 First, the rising importance of specialised expertise has
shifted influence to public officials with specialist careers, while politicians are typically
generalists. Second, public sector reform in many countries has led to increased external-
isation of functions to quasi-independent ‘agencies’ or ‘QUANGOs’ (quasi-autonomous
non-governmental organisations) which, within certain constraints, can make decisions on
their own. Third, the same reform processes have changed internal structures within public
organisations, with decentralisation of units and more ‘executive’ responsibility granted
to public officials. In short, strategy is increasingly part of the work of public officials too.
The end of chapter case, ‘Participative strategy in the city of Vaasa’, exemplifies some of
these issues.

16.2.4 Strategy consultants
External consultants are often used in the development of strategy. Leading strategy consult-
ancies include Bain, the Boston Consulting Group and McKinsey & Co. Most large general
consultancy firms such as E&Y, KPMG and PwC also have operations that provide services in
strategy development and analysis. There are also smaller ‘boutique’ consultancy firms and
individual consultants who specialise in strategy. Large multinationals also have their own
internal strategy consultants such as at Siemens and Ericsson.
   Consultants may play different roles in strategy development in organisations:18

• Analysing, prioritising and generating options. Strategic issues may have been identified by
  executives, but there may be so many of them, or disagreement about them, that there is
  lack of clarity on how the organisation should go forward. Consultants may bring a fresh
  external perspective to help prioritise issues or generate options for executives to consider.
  This may challenge executives’ preconceptions about the strategic issues.
• Transferring knowledge. Consultants are carriers of knowledge between clients. Strategy
  ideas developed for one client can be offered to the next client.
• Promoting strategic decisions. Consultants do not take decisions themselves, but their
  analysis and ideas may substantially influence client decision-makers. A number of major
  consultancies have been criticised in the past for undue influence on their client decisions,
  leading to major problems. For example, General Electric blamed McKinsey & Co.’s advice,
  that the 2008 economic crisis was only temporary, for its decision to delay rationalisation
  until long after its competitors.
• Implementing strategic change. Consultants play a significant role in project planning,
  coaching and training often associated with strategic change. This is an area that has seen
  considerable growth, not least because consultants were criticised for leaving organisa-
  tions with consultancy reports recommending strategies, but taking little responsibility
  for actually making these happen.

   The value of strategy consultants is often controversial. They are often blamed for failures
when it is the client’s poor management of the consulting process that is ultimately at fault.
Many organisations select their consultants unsystematically, give poor initial project briefs,
change expectations during the process and fail to learn from projects at the end. To improve
strategy-consulting outcomes, client organisations can take three measures:19

                                                                                             501
Chapter 16 The practice of strategy


                    • Professionalise purchasing of consulting services. Instead of hiring consulting firms based
                      on personal relationships with key executives, as is often the case, professionalised
                      purchasing can help ensure clear project briefs, a wide search for consulting suppliers,
                      appropriate pricing, complementarity between different consulting projects and proper
                      review at project-end. The German engineering company Siemens has professionalised its
                      consultancy purchasing, for example, establishing a shortlist of just ten preferred manage-
                      ment consulting suppliers.
                    • Develop supervisory skills in order to manage portfolios of consulting projects. The
                      German railway company Deutsche Bahn and automobile giant DaimlerChrysler both
                      have central project offices that control and coordinate all consulting projects throughout
                      their companies. As well as being involved in the initial purchasing decision, these offices
                      can impose systematic governance structures on projects, with clear responsibilities and
                      reporting processes, as well as review and formal assessment at project-end.
                    • Partner effectively with consultants to improve both effectiveness in carrying out the project
                      and knowledge transfer at the end of it. Where possible, project teams should include a
                      mix of consultants and managers from the client organisation, who can provide inside
                      information, guide on internal politics and, sometimes, enhance credibility and receptive-
                      ness. As partners in the project, client managers retain knowledge and experience when
                      the consultants have gone and can help in the implementation of recommendations.



                    16.2.5 Who to involve in strategy development?
                    The general trend in recent years has been to include many more people in the strategy
                    process than just those mentioned above, moving towards more ‘open strategy’.20
                       Openness comes in two dimensions. First, including more participants from different
                    constituencies inside and even outside the organisation (for example, middle managers and
                    other staff internally, key suppliers and customers, partners and investors externally). Second,
                    greater transparency about the strategy process itself, in other words what is revealed to
                    both internal audiences such as staff and external audiences such as investors, partners and
                    regulators. Openness is typically a matter of degree and rarely complete. There are pros and
                    cons to greater openness. On the one hand, it can improve strategy formulation by accessing
                    more ideas, and improve implementation by increasing key audiences’ understanding and
                    commitment. On the other hand, too many participants can slow down the strategy process
                    and risks the leaking of commercially sensitive information to competitors. The transparency
                    of the process will be dealt with later under Communicating (see Section 16.3.4).
                       There is no general rule about inclusion or exclusion in strategy-making, but there are
                    criteria that can guide managers. Figure 16.2 shows that the people involved should vary
                    according to the nature of the issue. For example, urgent issues that could involve major
                    changes to strategy (such as an acquisition opportunity) are best approached by small
                    special project teams, consisting of senior managers and perhaps planners and consultants.
                    Important, but less urgent, issues (such as deciding on key competitors) can benefit from
                    more prolonged and open strategic conversations, both formal and informal. Urgent issues
                    that do not involve major change (such as responding to competitor threats) require only
                    limited participation. Issues that may involve major changes but require idea generation
                    over time (such as the search for global opportunities) might benefit from more open parti-
                    cipation. This might be organised more formally through a series of planned events, such as
                    conferences bringing together large groups of managers in particular geographical regions.
                       Illustration 16.2 highlights the concerns of a CEO trying to decide whether to become
                    more open in her company’s strategising process. The City of Vaasa end of chapter case
                    provides a public-sector example.

16.3 Strategising
          Whereas the previous section introduced the key strategists, this section concentrates on
          what these people do – in other words, the activities of strategising. The section starts with
          strategy analysis, then issue-selling, decision-making and strategy communication. In prac-
          tice, of course, strategy activities rarely follow this logical sequence, or they may not happen
          at all. As shown in Chapter 13, strategies do not always come about in such ways and stra-
          tegic decisions are often made without formal analysis and evaluation. This reminds us that
          strategy development is a messy process.


          16.3.1 Strategy analysis
          Strategy analysis can be an important input into strategy-making and although managers
          often use a limited set of analytical tools, of which SWOT (strengths, weaknesses, opportu-
          nities and threats) analysis is by far the most widely used, in practice managers often deviate
          from the technical ideal.21 For example, SWOT analysis tends to produce unmanageably long
          lists of factors (strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats), often well over 50 or so.
          These are rarely probed or refined, little substantive analysis is done to investigate them and
          they are often not followed up systematically in subsequent strategic discussions. (See the
          discussion on SWOT in Section 4.4.4.)
              However, focusing criticism on managers for their analytical limitations may sometimes
          be misplaced. Firstly tools themselves contain particular content and methods for struc-
          turing thinking – which facilitates and constrains managers. Although this is useful in coping
          with complexity, where there is uncertainty, tools may offer dangerous oversimplifications.
          Secondly managers see strategy tools as a means to engage in strategy conversations but
          this will be influenced by their different viewpoints, knowledge and goals.22 Specifically

there are cost and purpose issues to consider. Analysis is costly in terms of both resources
(gathering information using consultants) and time – the risk of ‘paralysis by analysis’, where
managers spend too long perfecting their analyses and not enough time taking decisions
and acting upon them. How much analysis do managers really need? The purpose of analysis
is not always simply about providing the necessary information for good strategic decisions.
Ann Langley has shown that setting up a project to analyse an issue thoroughly may be a
deliberate form of procrastination, aimed at putting off a decision.23 It may be symbolic,
to rationalise a decision after it has already effectively been made. By asking managers to
analyse an issue it may get their buy-in to decisions that they might otherwise resist. Analyses
may also be political, to promote the agenda of a particular manager or part of the organ-
isation (see Chapter 13).
    The different purposes of strategy analysis have two key implications for managers:

• Design the analysis according to the real purpose. The range and quality of people
  involved, the time and budget allowed, and the subsequent communication of analysis
  results should all depend on underlying purpose, whether informational, political or
  symbolic. For example, prestigious strategy consulting firms are often useful for political
  and symbolic analyses. Involving a wide group of middle managers in the analysis may
  help with subsequent buy-in.
• Invest appropriately in technical quality. For many projects, improving the quality of the
  technical analysis will make a valuable addition to subsequent strategic decisions. On
  other occasions, insisting on technical perfection can be counter-productive. For example,
  a SWOT analysis that raises lots of issues may be a useful means of allowing managers to
  vent their own personal frustrations, before getting on with the real strategy work. It may
  sometimes be better to leave these issues on the table, rather than probing, challenging
  or even deleting them in a way that could unnecessarily alienate these managers for the
  following stages.


16.3.2 Strategic issue-selling
Organisations typically face many strategic issues at any point in time. But in complex organ-
isations these issues may not be appreciated by those involved in developing strategy. Some
issues will be filtered out by the organisational hierarchy; others will be sidelined by more
urgent pressures. Moreover, senior managers will rarely have sufficient time and resources to
deal with all the issues that do actually reach them. So strategic issues compete for attention.
What gets top management attention is not necessarily the most important issue.24 Issues
need to be ‘sold’.
   Strategic issue-selling is the process of gaining the attention and support of top
management and other important stakeholders. To gain attention and support of top
management, managers need to consider at least four issues:

• Issue packaging. Care should be taken with how issues are packaged or framed. Clearly
  the strategic importance of the issue needs to be underlined, particularly by linking it to
  critical strategic goals or performance metrics for the organisation. Generally clarity and
  succinctness win over complexity and length. It also usually helps if the issue is packaged
  with potential solutions. An issue can easily be put aside as too difficult to address if no
  ways forward are offered at the same time.

                       Here formal channels are split between corporate, line and staff. On the corporate
                       side, they include the annual business reviews that the CEO carries out with each
                       divisional head, plus the annual strategy retreats (or workshops) of the top executive
                       team. The line channel involves the regular line interaction of operational managers,
                       divisional heads and the CEO and other executive directors. Finally, there are the
                       various reporting systems to staff functions, including finance, human resources and
                       strategic planning. However, formal channels are rarely enough to sell strategic issues.
                       Informal channels can be very important and often decisive. Informal channels might
                       include ad hoc conversations with influential managers in corridors, on journeys or
                       over meals or drinks. Illustration 16.3 shows how informal channels can be important
                       for strategists.
                    • Sell alone or in coalitions. Managers should consider whether to press their issue on their
                      own or to assemble a coalition of supporters, preferably influential ones. A coalition adds
                      credibility and weight to the issue. The ability to gather a coalition of supporters can be
                      a good test of the issue’s validity: if other managers are not persuaded, then the CEO is
                      unlikely to be persuaded either. But notice that enlisting supporters may involve compro-
                      mises or reciprocal support of other issues, so blurring the clarity of the case being put
                      forward.
                    • Timing. Managers should also time their issue-selling carefully. For example, a short-term
                      performance crisis, or the period before the handover to a new top management team,
                      is not a good time to press long-term strategic issues.

                    16.3.3 Strategic decision making
                    Strategic decision making is not always rational. Nobel prize-winner Daniel Kahneman
                    and colleagues have developed an approach called ‘behavioral economics’, which seeks to
                    improve decision making by taking into account real-life human behaviour. 25 Kahneman
                    points out that even senior managers bring ‘cognitive biases’ to their decisions: their mental
                    processes are liable to neglect, distort or exaggerate certain issues. The trouble with cognitive
                    biases is that, by definition, it is very hard for people to recognise what they are suffering
                    from. However, Kahneman suggests that designing good decision-making processes can help
                    remedy the ill effects of these biases. He highlights five common decision-making biases,
                    along with ways to reduce them:

                    • Confirmation bias is the tendency to seek out data that confirm a favoured course of
                      action, and to neglect information that might disconfirm it. One way to counter this
                      confirmation bias is to insist that alternative options are always considered in decision
                      processes. Then the discussion shifts from whether or not to take a favoured action, to
                      how much better it really is compared to the alternatives.
                    • Anchoring bias is the common error of being tied (‘anchored’) to one piece of information
                      in making a decision. Anchors are often things that might have been valid in the past, but
                      may not hold true in the future. For example, managers may rely on past sales trends, and
                      neglect the possibility that these trends might change. Sometimes managers will make an
                      initial estimate of a cost or revenue, and allow that value to become entrenched in their
                      decision making, forgetting that it was only an estimate in the first place. One way of
                      countering anchoring biases is introducing different analytical methods into the process
                      (for instance, a discounted cash flow as well as a pay-back period analysis). A different
                      analysis may surface unacknowledged assumptions or force out new data or insights.
                    • Saliency bias refers to when a particular analogy becomes unduly influential (‘salient’). For
                      example, managers may say a particular project is just like a successful project in the past,
                      minimising differences: on the analogy with past experience, they simply expect success to
                      be repeated. It is important here to ask for other analogies, or to seek out possible differ-
                      ences between the successful case and the one being considered. A form of this saliency
                      bias is the so-called ‘halo effect’, where a manager or organisation that has been successful
                      in one domain is simply assumed to be successful in another: the manager or organisation is
                      treated like a saint (with a ‘halo’) and assumed to do no wrong. Again, it is important here
                      to check for differences. Just because a manager has been successful in managing a series
                      of acquisitions does not mean he or she will be equally so in managing a joint venture.
                    • Affect bias occurs when managers become too emotionally attached to a particular
                      option (too ‘affectionate’). In cases of issue-selling, this is often called champion’s
                      bias: the likelihood that people will exaggerate their case in favour of their particular
                      proposal. If the proposal comes from a team, it might be worth checking with members
                      individually for signs of discomfort: it may be possible to obtain a more balanced view
                      from the less enthusiastic team members. Having just the lead ‘champion’ present the
                      proposal on his or her own maximises the danger of hearing the most positive side of
                      the argument.
                    • Risk bias is where managers hold distorted views of risk. Managers are often over-
                      optimistic in assessing their ability to deliver on projects. Here Kahneman recommends
                      that instead of relying on the organisation’s own assessment of its capabilities (an ‘inside
                      view’), decision makers also look at the record of other organisations undertaking similar
                      projects (an ‘outside view’). It is easier to acknowledge the failures of other organisations
                      than to undertake a sceptical review of one’s own internal capabilities. On the other hand,

                             managers can sometimes be biased towards pessimism, so-called ‘risk aversion’. Their fear
                             of failure may be greater than their appetite for success. Risk aversion can be reduced by
                             reviewing incentives: the rewards of success can be either clarified or increased.

                              Thus Kahneman’s behavioural view leads to concrete methodologies to reduce biases
                          in strategic decision-making. Overall, he encourages hurried managers to ‘think slow’ – to
                          take the time to ask for additional views, analysis and data. Of course, managers should
                          recognise the danger of paralysis by analysis (Section 16.3.1): in fast-moving environments,
                          the informed intuition of experienced managers may be more effective than thorough but
                          time-consuming analyses.26 However, Kahneman believes that the costs of error generally
                          outweigh the costs of missed opportunities.
                              These insights from behavioural economics underline the potential benefits of constructive
                          conflict in decision making.27 Conflict can expose champion’s biases. It can challenge opti-
                          mistic self-assessments of managerial competence. Conflict is fostered by having diverse
                          managerial teams, with members prepared to be devil’s advocates, challenging assumptions
                          or easy consensus. But productive conflict needs careful management. Table 16.1 suggests
                          ways in which conflict can be managed based on key aspects of interaction. Based on the
                          idea of ‘games with rules’ the table summarises ways in which this might be done (also see
                          the discussion on ‘organisational ambidexterity’ in Section 14.3).
                              Recent work by Powell argues that focusing upon cognitive biases, as explanations for
                          strategies falling short of economic rationality, is not sufficient for better strategic decisions.
                          Strategy is not primarily a cognitive endeavour but about getting things done.28 To this end
                          it is important that strategies are behaviourally rational, which means they generate impul-
                          sive power for its own implementation. Powell makes the distinction between Mercenary
                          strategies, which are economically rational but do not enthuse people to act (hence having
                          to incentivise through financial inducements) and Romantic strategies, which inspire and
                          motivate people, but of course may not always lead to positive economic outcomes. Over-
                          emphasis on either may lead to disappointing outcomes, with over-analysis raising doubts
                          and concerns that demoralise strategists in the former, and impulsive unviable behaviour
                          in the latter. However a more blended approach that reduces the mercenary component
                          and increases the romantic, may well result in more effective strategies. Having said this it is
                          important too not to exaggerate the importance of decision making in strategy. As explained
                          in Chapter 13, many strategies are emergent rather than consciously decided anyway.

                    16.3.4 Communicating strategy
                    Deciding strategy is only one step: strategic decisions need to be communicated. The rise of
                    more open approaches to strategy has put a greater premium on transparency (Section 16.2.5).
                    Managers have to consider which stakeholders to inform (see Chapter 5) and how they should
                    tailor their messages to each. Shareholders, key customers and employees are likely to be
                    particularly central, all with different needs. For every new strategy, there should be a commu-
                    nications strategy to match. It is also important to remember that communication is a two-way
                    process. Harvard’s Michael Beer and Russell A. Eisenstat29 argue that effective communication
                    needs to involve both advocacy of a strategy by senior management and inquiry about the
                    concerns of influential internal and external stakeholders. In the absence of the former, there
                    is lack of clarity, confusion and frustration. In the absence of the latter, concerns will surface
                    in any case, but in ways that actively or passively undermine the new strategy.
                        As a minimum, effective employee communications are needed to ensure that the
                    strategy is understood. Research into the use of strategy communications during mergers
                    and acquisitions shows strategic communications practices influence outcome.30 Poor or
                    absent communications are likely to lead to two consequences:

                    • Strategic intent will be reinterpreted. It is inevitable that people in the organisation will
                      interpret intended strategy in terms of their local context and operational responsibilities.
                      The more such reinterpretation occurs, the more unlikely it is the intended strategy will
                      be implemented.
                    • Established routines will continue. Old habits die hard, so top management may underestimate
                      the need to make very clear what behaviours are expected to deliver a strategy. Of course,
                      effective communication is only one way in which change can be managed; the wider lessons
                      of managing strategic change in this regard need to be taken into account (see Chapter 15).

                       In shaping a communications strategy for employees, four elements need to be consid-
                    ered in particular:31

                    • Focus. Communications should focus on the key issues and components of the strategy.
                      Key note speeches for instance will often foreground key aspects of an organisation’s
                      strategy. However, if top management cannot show they are clear on these, then it cannot
                      be expected that others will be. It is also helpful to avoid unnecessary detail or complex
                      language. CEO Jack Welch’s famous statement that General Electric should be ‘either
                      Number One or Number Two’ in all its markets is remembered because of this clear focus
                      on the importance of being a dominant player wherever the company competed.
                    • Media. Choosing appropriate media to convey the new strategy matters. Mass media
                      such as e-mails, voicemails, company newsletters, videos, intranets, and senior manager
                      blogs achieves ‘reach’ with the strategy communication, ensuring all staff receive the same
                      message promptly, helping to avoid damaging uncertainty and rumour-mongering. Indeed
                      organising mass-media spectacles such as broadcasting live, key note speeches, has become
                      a central part of strategy work.32 However, face-to-face communications are important too
                      as they give depth to the message. Face-to-face demonstrates the personal commitment
                      of managers and allows interaction with concerned staff. One-to one conversations and
                      team meetings provide greater depth than mass communications. Senior managers may
                      undertake roadshows, carrying their message directly to various groups of employees with
                      conferences or workshops at different sites. They may also institute cascades, whereby each
                      level of manager is tasked to convey the strategy message directly to the staff reporting
                      to them, who in turn cascade the message to their staff, and so on through the organisa-
                      tion. Externally senior managers will also engage in analyst meetings and meet with key
                      investors. Of course, to be effective, it is essential the key issues and components of the

            strategy are clear. Roadshows, cascades and other forms of interaction may, of course, also
            raise new issues and should therefore be part of a two-way communication process.
          • Employee engagement. It is often helpful to engage employees more widely in the commu-
            nication strategy, so they can see what it means for them personally, how their role will
            change and to feel the organisation is listening to their concerns. Interchanges through
            roadshows and cascades can help, but some organisations use more imaginative means to
            create employee engagement. For example, one British public-sector organisation invited
            all its staff to a day’s conference introducing its new strategy, at which employees were
            invited to pin a photograph of themselves on a ‘pledge wall’, together with a hand-written
            promise to change at least one aspect of their work to fit the new strategy.33
          • Impact. Communications should be impactful, with powerful and memorable words and
            visuals. Recent research now shows the power of visuals for conveying strategy to recipi-
            ents.34 A strong ‘story-line’ can help by encapsulating the journey ahead and imagined
            new futures for the organisation and its customers. One struggling medical centre in
            New Mexico communicated its new strategy, and inspired its staff, with a story-line repre-
            senting the organisation as ‘The Raiders of the Lost Art’, conveying a simultaneous sense
            of courage in adversity and recovery of old values.35
             Senior managers spend a great deal of their time in face-to-face meetings over lunch
          or coffee or in corridors discussing and communicating strategy issues. As Sections 13.3.2
          and 13.3.4 explained, in such settings, strategic issues and solutions may arise on the basis of
          organisational politics or simple chance. This means strategy managers need political acumen
          and the ability to build coherent strategic narratives from, often, fragmented discussions.


16.4 Strategy methodologies
          Strategists have a range of standard methodologies to organise and guide their strategising
          activity. The methodologies introduced here are not analytical concepts or techniques
          presented earlier in the book, but widely used approaches to managing aspects of strategy
          work such as issue-selling or decision making. These could include strategy workshops (or
          ‘away-days’) and strategy projects (see below). Strategising output typically has to fit the
          format of a business case or strategic plan.

          16.4.1 Strategy workshops
          Strategies are often made through series of managerial meetings. These meetings frequently
          take the specific form of strategy workshops (sometimes called strategy away-days or
          off-sites).36 Such workshops usually involve groups of executives working intensively for
          one or two days, often away from the office, on organisational strategy. Such executives
          are typically senior managers in the organisation, although a wider group of managers can
          be used. Typically workshops are used to formulate or reconsider strategy, but also to review
          the progress of current strategy, address strategy implementation issues and to communi-
          cate strategic decisions to a larger audience. Workshops can be either ad hoc or part of the
          regular strategic planning process, and they may be stand-alone or designed as a series of
          events. As well as facilitating strategy-making, workshops can have additional roles in team-
          building and the personal development of individual participant. Illustration 16.4 shows how
          they can contribute to strategy development as well as how they can go wrong.
             Strategy workshops can be a valuable part of an organisation’s strategy-making activity.
          However their form can influence the nature of participants’ debate of strategy and its likely
          success – workshop design matters. Above all, whatever the purpose of the workshop, clarity

of purpose is strongly correlated with perceived success. Given this, if the purpose is to ques-
tion existing strategy or develop new strategy successful workshops are likely to involve:

• Strategy concepts and tools capable of promoting the questioning of the current strategy.
• A specialist facilitator to guide participants in the use of such tools and concepts, free
  managers to concentrate on the discussion, help keep the discussion focused on the stra-
  tegic issues and ensure participants contribute equally to discussion.
• The visible support of the workshop sponsor (perhaps the CEO) for the questioning and
  the facilitator. In the absence of this the workshop is unlikely to succeed.
• The diminishing of everyday functional and hierarchical roles. This may be aided by a
  distinctive off-site location to signal how different from everyday routine the work-
  shop is, help detach participants from day-to-day operational issues and symbolically
  affirm the occasion is not subject to the usual norms of executive team discussion.
  Ice-breaking and other apparently playful exercises – sometimes called ‘serious play’ – at
  the beginning of a workshop can help generate creativity and a willingness to challenge
  orthodoxies.37

   On the other hand, workshops with the purpose of reviewing the progress of current
strategy are likely to be successful if they have a more operational agenda and if participants
maintain functional and hierarchical roles.
   Workshops are, however, prone to at least two problems. First, when reduced to a routine
part of the strategic planning cycle, and involving the usual group of senior managers every
year, workshops may not be able to produce new ideas that significantly challenge the
status quo. On the other hand, workshops that are too radically separated from the ordinary
routines of the organisation can become detached from subsequent action: it can be difficult
to translate radical ideas and group enthusiasm back into the workplace.
   In designing workshops that will be closely connected to subsequent action, managers
should consider:

• Identifying agreed actions to be taken. Time should be set aside at the end of the work-
  shop for a review of workshop outputs and agreement on necessary actions to follow up.
  However this, of itself, may well not make a sufficiently powerful bridge to operational
  realities.
• Establishing project groups. Workshops can build on the cohesion built around partic-
  ular issues by commissioning groups of managers to work together on specific workshop
  derived tasks and report on progress to senior management.
• Nesting of workshops. Especially if a workshop has expected participants to question
  current strategy and develop radical new ideas, it may be useful to have a series of work-
  shops, each of which becomes more and more grounded in operational realities.
• Making visible commitment by the top management. The CEO or other senior manager
  needs to signal commitment to workshop outcomes not only by their statements but by
  their actual behaviours.


16.4.2 Strategy projects
Both strategy-making and strategy implementation are often organised in the form of
projects or task forces.38 Strategy projects involve teams of people assigned to work on
particular strategic issues over a defined period of time. Projects can be instituted in order
to explore problems or opportunities as part of the strategy development process. Or they
might be instituted to implement agreed elements of a strategy, for example an organ-
isational restructuring or the negotiation of a joint venture. Translating a strategic plan or

                                                                                            513
Chapter 16 The practice of strategy


                    workshop outcomes into a set of projects is a good means of ensuring that intentions are
                    translated into action. They can also include a wider group of managers in strategy activity.
                       Strategy projects should be managed like any other project. In particular they need:

                    • A clear brief or mandate. The project’s objectives should be agreed and carefully managed.
                      These objectives are the measure of the project’s success. ‘Scope creep’, by which addi-
                      tional objectives are added as the project goes on, is a common danger.
                    • Top management commitment. The continuing commitment of top management, espe-
                      cially the top management ‘client’ or ‘sponsor’, needs to be maintained. Top management
                      agendas are frequently shifting, so communications should be regular.
                    • Milestones and reviews. The project should have from the outset clear milestones with an
                      agreed schedule of intermediate achievements. These allow project review and adjust-
                      ment where necessary, as well as a measure of ongoing success.
                    • Appropriate resources. The key resource is usually people. The right mix of skills needs to be in
                      place, including project management skills, and effort should be invested in ‘team-building’
                      at the outset. Strategy projects are often part-time commitments for managers, who have to
                      continue with their ‘day jobs’. Attention needs to be paid to managing the balance between
                      managers’ ordinary responsibilities and project duties: the first can easily derail the second.

                       Projects can easily proliferate and compete. Senior management should have careful over-
                    sight of the whole portfolio of projects in an organisation, and be ready to merge and end
                    projects according to changing circumstances. Otherwise a proliferation of projects can easily
                    end up with so-called ‘initiative fatigue’.


                    16.4.3 Hypothesis testing
                    Strategy project teams are typically under pressure to deliver solutions to complex problems
                    under tight time constraints. Hypothesis testing is a methodology used particularly in
                    strategy projects for setting priorities in investigating issues and options and is widely
                    used by strategy consulting firms and members of strategy project teams.
                        Hypothesis testing in strategy is adapted from the hypothesis testing procedures of
                    science.39 It starts with a proposition about how things are (the descriptive hypothesis), and
                    then seeks to test it with real-world data. For example, a descriptive hypothesis in strategy
                    could be that being large-scale in a particular industry is essential to profitability. To test
                    it, a strategy project team would begin by gathering data on the size of organisations in
                    the industry and correlate these with the organisations’ profitabilities. Confirmation of this
                    initial descriptive hypothesis (i.e. small organisations are relatively unprofitable) would then
                    lead to several prescriptive hypotheses about what a particular organisation should do. For
                    a small-scale organisation in the industry, prescriptive hypotheses would centre on how to
                    increase scale: one would be that acquisitions were a good means to achieve the necessary
                    scale; another would be that alliances were the right way. These prescriptive hypotheses
                    might then become the subjects of further data testing.
                        This kind of hypothesis testing is ultimately about setting practical priorities in strategy
                    work. Hypothesis testing in business therefore differs from strict scientific procedure
                    (see Illustration 16.5). The aim finally is to concentrate attention on a very limited set of
                    promising hypotheses, not on the full set of all possibilities. Data are gathered in order to
                    support favoured hypotheses, whereas in science the objective is formally to try to refute
                    hypotheses. Business hypothesis testing aims to find a robust and satisfactory solution
                    within time and resource constraints, not to find some ultimate scientific truth. Selecting
                    the right hypotheses can be helped by applying Quick and Dirty Testing (QDT). This relies
                    on the project team’s existing experience and easily accessed data in order to speedily
                    reject unpromising hypotheses, before too much time is wasted on them.

Chapter 16 The practice of strategy


                    16.4.4 Business cases and strategic plans
                    Strategising activities, such as workshops or projects, are typically oriented towards creating
                    an output in the form of a business case or strategic plan. Keeping this end goal in mind
                    provides a structure for the strategising work: what needs to be produced shapes the strat-
                    egising activities. A business case usually provides the data and argument in support of a
                    particular strategy proposal, e.g. investment in new equipment. A strategic plan provides
                    the data and argument in support of a strategy for the whole organisation. It is there-
                    fore likely to be more comprehensive, taking an overall view of the organisation’s direction
                    over a substantial period of time. Many organisations have a standard template for making
                    business cases or proposing a strategic plan, and where these exist, it is wise to work with
                    that format. Where there is no standard template, it is worth investigating recent successful
                    business cases or plans within the organisation, and borrowing features from them.
                       A project team intending to make a business case should aim to meet the following
                    criteria:40

                    • Focus on strategic needs. The team should identify the organisation’s overall strategy and
                      relate its case closely to that, not just to any particular departmental needs. A business
                      case should not look as if it is just an HR department or IT department project, for example.
                      The focus should be on a few key issues, with clear priority normally given to those that
                      are both strategically important and relatively easy to address.
                    • Supported by key data. The team will need to assemble appropriate data, with financial data
                      demonstrating appropriate returns on any investment typically essential. However, qualita-
                      tive data should not be neglected – for example, striking quotations from interviews with
                      employees or key customers, or recent mini-cases of successes or failures in the organisation
                      or at competitors. Some strategic benefits simply cannot be quantified, but are not the less
                      important for that: information on competitor moves can be persuasive here. The team should
                      provide background information on the rigour and extent of the research behind the data.
                    • Provide a clear rationale. Analysis and data are not enough; make it clear why the proposals
                      are being made. The reasons for the choice of recommendations therefore need to be
                      explicit. Many specific evaluation techniques that can be useful in a business cases are
                      explained in Chapter 12.
                    • Demonstrate solutions and actions. As suggested earlier, issues attached to solutions tend
                      to get the most attention. The team should show how what is proposed will be acted on,
                      and who will be responsible. Possible barriers should be clearly identified. Also recognise
                      alternative scenarios, especially downside risk. Implementation feasibility is critical.
                    • Provide clear progress measures. When seeking significant investments over time, it is
                      reassuring to offer clear measures to allow regular progress monitoring. Proposing review
                      mechanisms also adds credibility to the business case.

                       Strategic plans are similar to business cases in terms of focus, data, actions and progress
                    measures. Strategic plans are, however, more comprehensive, and they may be used for
                    entrepreneurial start-ups, business units within a large organisation, or for an organisation
                    as a whole. Again formats vary. However, a typical strategic plan has the following elements,
                    which together should set a strategy team’s working agenda:41

                    • Mission, goals and objectives statement. This is the point of the whole strategy, and the
                      critical starting place. While it is the starting place, in practice a strategy team might iterate
                      back to this in the light of other elements of the strategic plan. It is worth checking back
                      with earlier statements that the organisation may have made to ensure consistency.
                      Section 1.2.2 provides more guidance on mission, goals and objectives.

                       • Environmental analysis. This should cover the key issues identified in terms of the whole
                         of the environment, both macro trends and more focused issues to do with customers,
                         suppliers and competitors. The team should not stop at the analysis, but draw clear stra-
                         tegic implications (see Chapters 2 and 3).
                       • Resource and capability analysis. This should include a clear identification of the key
                         strengths and weaknesses of the organisation, in terms of resources, capabilities and its
                         products relative to its competitors and include a clear statement of competitive advan-
                         tage (see Chapter 4).
                       • Business model. This should describe the value proposition for customers, the arrange-
                         ment of resources and capabilities that produces this value and the associated revenue
                         and cost structures (see Chapter 7).
                       • Strategic options. This will set out a number of possible strategic initiatives that might be
                         pursued to improve the organisation’s strategic position. These should be clearly related
                         to the environmental and organisational analyses and support the mission, goals and
                         objectives of the organisation (see Chapters 5, 7 and 11).
                       • Proposed strategy. This should show clearly why this proposed strategy is superior to the
                         foregoing options (see Chapter 12).
                       • Additional resources. The team will need to provide a detailed analysis of the resources
                         required, with options for acquiring them. Critical resources are financial, so the plan should
                         include income statements, cash flows and balance sheets over the period of the plan.
                         Other important resources might be human, particularly managers or people with partic-
                         ular skills. A clear and realistic timetable for implementation is also needed (see Chapter 15).
                       • Key changes. What does the plan envisage are the key changes required in structures,
                         systems and culture and how are these to be managed? (See Chapters 13, 14 and 15.)

                      Summary
                      • The practice of strategy involves critical choices about who to involve in strategy, what to
                        do in strategising activity, and which strategising methodologies to use in order to guide
                        this activity.
                      • Chief executive officers, senior managers, non-executive directors, strategic planners,
                        middle managers, employees and external executives such as investors, strategy consult-
                        ants and other stakeholders are all involved in strategising. Their degree of appropriate
                        involvement should depend on the nature of the strategic issues.
                      • Strategising activity can involves analysing, issue-selling, decision-making and communi-
                        cating. Managers should not expect these activities to be fully rational or logical and can
                        valuably appeal to the non-rational characteristics of the people they work with.
                      • Practical methodologies to guide strategising activity include strategy workshops, strategy
                        projects, hypothesis testing, and creating business cases and strategic plans.

                      16.1     Go to the careers or recruitment web page of one of the big strategy consultants
                               (such as www.bain.com, www.bcg.com, www.mckinsey.com). What does this tell
                               you about the nature of strategy consulting work? Would you like this work?
                      16.2     Go to the website of a large organisation (private or public sector) and assess the
                               way it communicates its strategy to its audiences. With reference to Section 16.3.4,
                               how focused is the communication; how impactful is it; and how likely is it to
                               engage employees?
                      16.3     If you had to design a strategy workshop, suggest who the participants in the
                               workshop should be and what roles they should play in (a) the case where an
                               organisation has to re-examine its fundamental strategy in the face of increased
                               competitive threat; (b) the case where an organisation needs to gain commitment
                               to a long-term, comprehensive programme of strategic change.
                      16.4✱    For any case study in the book, imagine yourself in the position of a strategy
                               consultant and propose an initial descriptive hypothesis (Section 16.4.3) and define
                               the kinds of data that you would need to test it. What kinds of people would you
                               want in your strategy project team (see Sections 16.2.5 and 16.4.2)?
                      16.5✱    Go to a business plan archive (such as the University of Maryland’s www.business-
                               planarchive.org or use a Google search). Select a business plan of interest to you
                               and, in the light of Section 16.4.4, assess its good points and its bad points.

                      Integrative assignment
                      16.6✱    For an organisation with which you are familiar, or one of the case organisations,
                               write a strategic plan (for simplicity, you might choose to focus on an undiversified
                               business or a business unit within a larger corporation). Where data are missing,
                               make reasonable assumptions or propose ways of filling the gaps. Comment on
                               whether and how you would provide different versions of this strategic plan for
                               (a) investors; (b) employees.

Commentary on
Part III Strategy in action
                      This part of Exploring Strategy has considered strategy in action. Although this is the last part,
                      this does not imply that action necessarily follows logically from the analysis of strategic posi-
                      tion and choices. Chapter 1 introduced the overall model for this text, made up of three over-
                      lapping circles of position, choices and action. The point of the framework is that strategy
                      should not be seen as simply a linear process: the issues raised in different parts of this text
                      interact and inform each other. While, for purposes of clarity, this text presents strategy imple-
                      mentation following strategy formulation in a logical sequence, in practice this is by no means
                      always so.




      Design lens
      The design lens builds on the notion that thinking precedes organisational action, so that strategy is, indeed,
      a linear process. Rational analysis and design are seen as powerful motivators of strategic action. In this view
      therefore, managers should:

      • Make the business case: the most important factor in persuading managerial colleagues and other internal and
        external stakeholders is logical analysis and evidence, for example rigorous evaluation criteria (Chapter 12)
        and business plans (Chapter 16).
      • Exercise tight change management: strategies are best implemented through systematic use of the levers for
        change (Chapter 15) and formal structures and systems (Chapter 14), leaving little scope for improvisation.
      • Reinforce coherent action: strategies will be most effectively implemented if organisational structures and
        systems are configured so that they are mutually supporting (Chapter 14).




      Experience lens
      The experience lens is sceptical about the place of rationality in securing strategy implementation. Managerial
      biases and organisational conservatism mean that strategy is heavily influenced by the past. The experience lens
      suggests it is important to:

      • Challenge biases: strategy evaluation and strategic plans (Chapters 12 and 13) are likely to be shaped by the
        experience of those who do them, so it is important to challenge what may be taken for granted.
      • Pick your teams carefully: if strategies are shaped by the people involved in making them, then it really matters
        who is in your strategy development teams and projects (Chapter 16).
      • Recognise the challenge of change: given the weight of past experience on organisations, the issues
        of leadership and change (Chapter 15) are likely to be among the most important and difficult in this
        whole text.

                       In this Commentary the strategy lenses are used to explore more deeply this key issue of
                    how formulation and implementation fit together. What are the practical implications of the
                    various lenses for how to put strategy into action?

                       Note that:

                    • There is no suggestion here that any one of these lenses is better the others. The point is
                      to avoid using just one. Each lens gives you extra ways to explore strategic issues.
                    • For a deeper understanding of this Commentary, you might want to review the Part I
                      Commentary, following Chapter 5, which provides a fuller introduction of the four lenses,
                      plus an illustrative case. The Commentary at the end of Part II is also relevant.




Variety lens
According to the variety lens, strategies can bubble up from the periphery and are then often selected and
retained according to semi-conscious organisational processes. Innovation does not come simply from top
management command. The variety lens therefore encourages you to:

• Favour inclusiveness: in deciding who to include in strategy development (Chapter 13 and section 16.2), inno-
  vative strategies are more likely to come – and be implemented – if you include as many people as possible
  from outside the usual organisational elite.
• Check the rules: the variety lens points to the power of taken-for-granted procedures, so it is wise to review
  standard strategy evaluation criteria and organisational systems for hidden biases in strategy selection and
  retention (Section 12.3 and Section 14.3).
• Be ready to go ‘off-plan’: given the role of surprise and spontaneity, it may be wise to allow for flexibility with
  regard to plans (Chapter 13) and formal strategic change programmes (Chapter 15).




Discourse lens
Through this lens, language is highly influential on how strategies are interpreted and implemented. Discourse
can both smooth and inhibit putting strategy into action. It is important to recognise that:

• Words matter: the symbolic power of language can make the difference between success and failure, for
  example in leading transformational change (Section 15.4) or communicating strategy (Section 16.3).
• Organisations are political: discourses can be used to promote sectional interests, so it is important to be
  sensitive to, and sometimes challenge, the language of issue-selling (Section 16.3) and alliance and network
  building (Section 14.5) for example.
• Language is an entry ticket: for managers and consultants who seek to enter into the organisation’s strategy
  conversation (Section 16.2), it is vital to be able to speak the organisational language of strategy fluently and
  confidently.

Case studies
Co-edited by Clive Kerridge and
         Jason Evans
Guide to using the case studies
         The main text of this book includes 68 short illustrations, 15 thinking differently sections
         and 16 case examples which have been chosen to develop and illustrate specific issues in
         the text and/or provide practical examples of how business and public-sector organisations
         are managing strategic issues. The Case Collection which follows allows the reader to
         extend this linking of theory and practice further by analysing the strategic issues of specific
         organisations in much greater depth and proposing ‘solutions’ to some of the problems or
         difficulties identified. There are also over 40 classic cases on the Companion Website. These
         are a selection of cases from past editions of the book which remain relevant for teaching.
             The case studies are intended to serve as a basis for class discussion and not as an
         illustration of either good or bad management practice. They provide readers with a core
         of cases that, together, cover the main issues in the text. They are a useful backbone to a
         programme of study and could be supplemented by other material. We have provided a
         mixture of longer and shorter cases to increase the flexibility for teachers. Combined with
         the illustrations and the short case examples at the end of each chapter (in both versions
         of the book), this increases the reader’s and tutor’s choice. For example, we offer a number
         of options for exploring the issues in Chapter 2 on the Macro-environment. Thus the case
         example (Alibaba: the Yangtse River Crocodile) at the end of Chapter 2 provides a short
         case to test students’ core understanding of the main environmental issues. In the case
         collection, the Siemens A case offers a concise focus on an important industrial group in
         a rapidly changing environment, while the Global Pharmaceutical Industry case has the
         material needed for a more comprehensive analysis. Some cases are written entirely from
         published sources but most have been prepared in cooperation with, and with the approval
         of, the management of the organisation concerned. We would nonetheless also encourage
         readers and tutors to take every opportunity to explore live strategic issues in both their
         own organisation and others.
             The following brief points of guidance should prove useful in selecting and using the
         case studies provided:

         • The summary table that follows indicates the main focus of each of the chosen case
           studies – together with important subsidiary foci (where appropriate). In general, the
           sequence of cases is intended to mirror the chapter sequence. However, this should not
           be taken too literally because, of course, many of these cases cover a variety of issues. The
           ‘classification’ provided is therefore for guidance only. We expect readers to seek their
           own lessons from cases, and tutors to use cases in whichever way and sequence best fits
           the purpose of their programmes.
         • In the commentary at the end of Part III of the book we introduce the concept of ‘strategy
           lenses’. There are several cases that lend themselves to exploration through different
           lenses e.g. the Man Utd FC and Adnams cases.
         • Where cases have been chosen to illustrate the issues of strategic choice and strategy
           in action covered later in the book, it will normally be a prerequisite that some type of
           analysis of the strategic position is undertaken, using the case material. So care needs to
           be taken to balance the time taken on such strategic analysis in order to allow the time
           required to analyse the main issues for which the case has been chosen.
         • Where the text and cases are being used as the framework for a strategy programme (as
           we hope they will), it is important that students undertake additional reading from other
           sources and that their ‘practical’ work is supplemented by other material as mentioned

  above. Frequently company websites can be used to provide additional information,
  especially the latest financial figures.
• The cases do not have questions attached (although suggested questions are provided in
  the instructor’s manual) in order to allow programme leaders to use the case in the most
  appropriate way for their own purposes. However, the cases are written in such a way as
  to suggest the key issues they raise.
• For some of our cases (e.g. Ryanair and Manchester United FC) additional material to
  supplement cases can be found in the instructor’s manual online.
• While every effort has been made to update the cases to incorporate the latest
  information and developments, inevitably tutors will be using the cases after there have
  been developments – so we would urge tutors to research and update cases themselves.

patterns have required Vision Express, one of the three leading ‘multiples’, to adapt its strategies to a

This case addresses environmental analysis and corporate growth strategy during a critical organisational
transformation. Ricoh Canada Inc. had long relied on the same business model and used it to become
a national leader in digital print and imaging, but a combination of changing consumer behaviour
and competition threatened the profitability of this market. Over the previous five years, RCI had
been transitioning away from its traditional market to the large and diverse services sector. Although
full of opportunity, RCI had little experience in the services market and had yet to settle on a growth
strategy. This case is well suited to industry and competitive analysis, as well as discussions of strategic
positioning; RCI had to assess itself as an organisation and its place in the market to create a sustain-
able growth strategy.

The case examines the role of resources and capabilities in building competitive advantage and the key
issues to consider while evaluating the sustainability of competitiveness. H&M has enjoyed a leading
position in the global fashion and apparel market thanks to its unique concept, business approach and
ability to combine elegant designs with affordable prices. That position, however, has been challenged by
key competitors and H&M needs to consider this and evaluate the sustainability of competitive advantage
in their current resources and capabilities and consider new ones provided the digitalisation of the industry.
The case explores the areas and functions in which H&M has enjoyed advantage vis-à-vis its competitors
and how, if at all, this advantage can be sustained in the long term against major and new competitors.

The notion of ‘strategic corporate social responsibility’ implies an improved fit between a corporation’s
strategy and its responsibility activities, making these less ‘philanthropic’ and more relevant to business –
ideally raising the status and impact of CSR in daily corporate life. Danish medical devices company Coloplast
went on the journey from philanthropic CSR to strategic CSR with its programme ‘Access to Healthcare’ that
aims to improve healthcare in emerging markets. But the journey from lofty philanthropic vision to practical
impact was far from straightforward, and blurring the line between business and CSR has also changed the
CSR ambition.

This case describes playing and financial issues at English professional football club Manchester United
FC (MUFC), focusing on problems on the field as well as debt and ownership issues. Football in Europe
is becoming dominated by a small number of very rich clubs – can MUFC compete successfully? The
financial ‘fair play’ regulations and the power of rich billionaire owners have changed the football
landscape. Will Manchester United recover its pre-eminent position in English and European football
or will it struggle to compete with the elite clubs? The case involves a number of issues including
ownership structures, football finances, governance and the expectations of different stakeholders.

In the early 2000s French universities found themselves poorly ranked when compared with international
competitors. In response, five prestigious French institutions, including Université Paris-Dauphine, elected
to join forces through a scientific cooperation foundation in order to reinforce their international visibility,
becoming the first step towards the establishment of Paris Sciences et Lettres (PSL). Between 2010 and
2018, the alliance grew to include 19 entities, with the aim of becoming a completely integrated university.
This case study deals with the challenges the Université Paris-Dauphine faces in its integration into PSL.

This case study concentrates on how Ryanair could continue to effectively pursue its budget airline
business model in the face of external and internal challenges. Previously, in 2013, Ryanair was able
to successfully navigate a complete change in its service philosophy and delivery in its Always Getting
Better (AGB) programme. In 2018–19, a new theme is the carrier’s labour problems: when confronted
by pilot and cabin crew strikes and threats of further unrest, it reversed its previous stance against the
recognition of trade unions.

Following its acquisitions of the American brewer Miller
in 2002, Grupo Empresarial Bavaria, South America’s
second largest brewer in 2005, and the Australian Beer
Group Fosters in 2011, SABMiller had become the second
largest brewer by volume and profits in the world. By 2015
its market share by volume was 12 per cent and its brand
portfolio included international brands Pilsner Urquell,
Peroni Nastro Azzurro, Miller Genuine Draft, and Grolsch
along with local country brands such as Aguila, Castle
Lager, Miller Lite, VB, Snow and Tyskie.
    Despite these successes, the dramatic consolidation in
the brewing industry continued. In the early 1990s the
five largest brewing companies accounted for just 17 per
cent of global beer sales. By 2014 the largest four brew-

                                 and exploit opportunities for growth within our existing business portfolio. This can involve
                                 a range of activities, from entering into local joint ventures or partnerships, to buying or
                                 building breweries, to acquiring local brands to help shape a full, local, brand portfolio.’

 2. Developing strong,           ‘Our aim is to develop an attractive brand portfolio that meets consumers’ needs in each of
 relevant brand portfolios in    our markets. In many markets, growth is fastest at the top end, as shown by the increasing
 the local market                popularity of our international premium brands. Another rising consumer trend is the shift
                                 towards fragmentation. Affluent consumers are varying their choices and becoming more
                                 interested in speciality brands, craft beers, foreign imports and other subdivisions of the
                                 premium segment. And a third trend is the growing importance of female consumers.’

 3. Constantly raising the       ‘In order to raise our performance, we need to become more efficient, especially in our
 performance of local            manufacturing processes. Efficiency is part of our day-to-day management and the rise

                                 costs and to ensure that the right products reach the right outlets in the right condition.’

 4. Leveraging our global        ‘As a global organisation we are constantly seeking to use the benefits of our scale while

Severstal have responded by taking a new strategic direction defined by consolidation, investment in

For the first 99 years of its existence Svenska Handelsbanken, or Handelsbanken for short, was simply
one of the major Swedish universal banks, not dissimilar to its competitors. Today, Handelsbanken is
one of the key players in the Scandinavian banking market, it has chosen a strategic path that has been
significantly different from those of its competitors. For the past 45 years, the bank has followed a
process of decentralisation, making the 800+ local branches the most important units in its structure.
To a large extent business decisions are made at a branch level, and despite the rise of internet banking
since the 1990s, the number of branches has been kept constant in the Swedish market, whilst increas-
ing internationally. Handelsbanken is known today as one of Scandinavia’s most profitable banks, hav-
ing a strong financial standing even in times of financial unrest. The bank’s success is often attributed
to its culture, emphasising decentralisation, cost consciousness, and a conviction that a company that
wants to outperform its competitors must be different from the mainstream.

         Case                         Has Teva been saved? Responding to challenges
                                      and problems in generic pharmaceuticals

This case explores the turnaround strategy being pursued by Teva, an Israel-based pharmaceutical
company. It looks at the various international strategies that grew the organisation to become the
world’s largest generic manufacturer, with a diversified platform spread across many different manu-
facturing sites. It outlines how, under the direction of CEO and Chairman Eli Hurvitz, Teva followed an
aggressive inorganic growth programme and branched into branded or non-generic pharmaceuticals.
However, in an increasingly challenging external environment, the resulting complexity affected prof-
itability and led to a failure to achieve the bold revenue growth targets, with consequent boardroom
turmoil and investor unease. A series of top management changes followed, each associated with a
new strategy but with increasingly disappointing performance and increasing debt. Under the fourth
new management team in five years, the company announced a new strategy of swingeing cost cuts
and closures from 2018, and a renewed focus on core markets.


In December 2017 the new CEO of Teva, Kåre Schultz
announced the fourth new strategy for Teva in the last
eight years. In a letter to Prime Minister Benjamin Netan-
yahu he wrote: ‘We, the board of directors and manage-
ment of the company, wish to assure you that after careful
examination of the alternatives, we have no other choice –
we must save Teva.’1 The share price had halved in 12
months and, faced with huge debt, a long-term reduction
in turnover, a sharp decline in profitability and the loss of
patents in its most profitable products, they had no option
(he wrote) but to cut around 25 per cent of the workforce,
consolidate and close production sites, and significantly
reduce product lines.
    This was a shocking moment for many in Israel where
Teva is seen as ‘the people’s stock’ with the fortunes of many
individual investors and company pension funds being
closely linked to it.2 This new strategy was in sharp contrast
to the growth plans of previous CEO, Erez Vigodman who
had driven through the purchase of Allergan’s generic busi-
ness at a cost of over $40bn in 2015, doubling the size of the
organisation but leaving it with considerable debt. Schultz           Source: Clynt Garnham Medical/Alamy Images.

Counterstrategy: resisting the Mexican narco-trafficking business


    At the same time, the Mexican state also has to respond to    The Sinaloa Cartel:
various national and international influences. In a democracy,
where the President has just a few years to turn things around,   • CBS News, El Chapo’s Escape, www.youtube.com/

    Evidently, the policy of armed attacks on the NTO

part, this was because that strategy had not attacked the         • Insight Crime, Steven Dudley on the Zetas-Lazca capture

                                       family-run tourism business
          Study                        Ron Livingstone


The Oak Tree Inn is a very successful tourism business in a small, picturesque village called Balmaha
(with a population of around 60 people), on the east bank of Loch Lomond, one of Scotland’s most
iconic natural locations and within Scotland’s first ever National Park. The award-winning inn is a
family-owned business comprising holiday accommodation (sleeping 90 guests a night), an authentic
Scottish bar, restaurant, artisan coffee and ice-cream shop (both home produced) and a popular village
shop. It employs 100 staff (some seasonal). The business had a turnover in 2018 of £3m ($3.8m, €3.4m)
and the owner-directors have aspirations to grow to £10m ($12.8m, €11.3m) by 2025. However, the
question now is, how to continue to grow this successful business, given that its location has a restrict-
ive physical capacity in the area for growth in the number of customers able to visit?

analysis can be conducted to highlight some of the unique features of the environment in which the
hospital operates. Senior managers have embarked on a formal planning process and the effectiveness
of both the process of strategy development and the outcome can be explored and critiqued. The

public sector, organisations can be seen to compete with each other for market share and a share of

now faces the challenge of repositioning the business in the marketplace.

This case examines Dörr & Portbolaget i Vittaryd’s1 (DP) development from a company with a trad-
itional top-down management structure, to a company characterised by a more ‘open way’ of working
with strategy – a change that has proved successful so far. The question now is – how open can you be?


As Johan, the CEO of Dörr och Portbolaget (DP), climbed
the stairs from the shop floor to the office, he reflected on
what he had just seen. Entering the office, he remarked
to his brother David (the Marketing Manager) that soon
there would be no more work for him! It seemed that
now the blue-collar workers had taken over most of the
recruitment process too, referring to the fact that the
workers were at that moment interviewing and ‘testing’
a candidate for a vacancy in the production department.
His tone was mixed – proud but also somewhat puzzled.
Was there no limit to how much strategic work could be
handed over to the company staff?

This case is concerned with how strategy might be determined in practice. It explains the strategic
issues facing a (hypothetical) company producing plastic home-ware products and the strategic options
being advocated to tackle them. Profiles of the board members are provided so the case lends itself to
a role-play exercise in which they discuss the options as well as the underlying purpose of HomeCo and
the objectives it should be pursuing.

‘Exploring Strategy stands out as an excellent textbook on strategic management that covers
all the basics yet, unlike other texts, adds onto this a coverage of strategy process and the

strategy. It is a must-have for students, scholars, and practitioners’.
Dr. Florian Kapmeier, Professor for Strategy and International Project Management, Reutlin-
gen University, ESB Business School
‘When teaching and learning with this book, strategy comes alive! Exploring Strategy
addresses the fascinating issues of “strategy in action”. As strategic change is everywhere
nowadays, this textbook provides unique and invaluable insights for the men and women
who are daily involved in the processes and practice of strategizing.’
Linda Rouleau, Professor of Management, HEC Montréal

Mohammad Roohanifar, Manchester Matropolitan University


Exploring Strategy is designed to help students think and behave like a manager. With
over one million copies sold worldwide, Exploring Strategy has long been the essential
introduction to strategy for the managers of today and tomorrow. From entrepreneurial start-
ups to multinationals, charities to a range of public sector organisations, this book raises the
big questions about organisations – how they prosper, how they grow, how they innovate and
how they change.
The twelfth edition of Exploring Strategy has been comprehensively updated to help you:
• Understand clearly the key concepts, frameworks and tools of strategy
• Explore topical strategy issues including platform business models and network effects,
  ecosystems, corporate strategy divestments, and non-market strategy.
• Grasp real-world processes and practices of strategic management including new ways of
  doing ‘open strategy’
• Learn from case studies on world-famous organisations such as Alibaba, Airbnb, IKEA,
  Rocket Internet, Uber and Wanda. The Text and Cases version also covers events and
  organisations as diverse as Adnams, Siemens, Air Asia, Apple, Handelsbanken, Glastonbury
  and the Indian Premier League.
