Personal foreword
I am honoured to be asked to write a personal foreword to the latest edition of
Logistics Management and Strategy. Alan, my husband until his untimely death in
October 2012, was justifiably proud of this book; it epitomises his approach to
teaching and training, delivering applied theory and research to satisfy rigorous
academic enquiry, in a format attractive and useful to busy practitioners and
new recruits to the industry. He would be delighted to see his work reach a fifth
edition; he relished the challenge of developing a popular and trusted resource,
ever seeking to progress in the light of latest thinking and innovation.
Before his death, Alan chose his colleague Heather to take on the authorship
of this book with co-author Remko, knowing she would treat his work exactly as
he would hers - with respect, a critical eye and determination to improve. This
edition builds on the foundation of his achievement whilst passing the baton to
the next generation. Heather and Remko, I salute you, and wish you, this book
and all its readers every success.

Professional foreword
I am delighted to introduce Logistics Management and Strategy, now in its fifth
edition, a further aid in our ability to drive our understanding of such a critical
part of the business environment. In Bausch & Lomb logistics remains a key area
of management attention, given its central role in customer service and the op­
portunities it provides for cost control, two fundamental essentials for any global
business today.
Bausch & Lomb is committed to producing state-of-the-art optical products,
from contact lenses to cataract surgery and the fast-growing optical pharmaceuti­
cal markets. These complex supply chains cover five continents and serve varying
types of customers including hospitals, opticians and multiple retailers. They in­
volve stock-keeping units (SKUs) requiring temperature control, serial traceability
and sterility, and make for a diverse and challenging set of logistics demands.
When you then add these challenges to a range of over 100,000 SKUs - with some
products being offered in over 7,000 different refractive powers/pack sizes - then
you can understand why utilising the very latest approaches to logistics manage­
ment and strategy is absolutely crucial.
In recent years we have invested heavily in automated warehouses, such as at
our site in Amsterdam, recently recognised as one of the 'top 10' logistics facilities
in the Netherlands. We have also developed our utilisation of agile logistics. This
has been addressed by reducing the number of base products produced in our 17
factories, whilst increasing our customer responsiveness through postponement of
labelling, bundling, promotional artwork and language compliance. In this regard,
being a member of the Agile Supply Chain Research Club at Cranfield and working
with Alan, and more recently Heather, has been a rewarding and beneficial experi­
ence. I note that some of our experience has been invested in Chapter 7.
In the last two years, Bausch & Lomb has greatly reduced inventory holdings
through a number of logistics initiatives - improving working capital whilst
maintaining, and even improving, customer service levels.
But the fight goes on, and it is with texts such as Logistics Management and
Strategy in your armoury that you can continue to drive further improvements in
your supply chain. The great aspect of this text is its readability; it does not seek to
lecture the reader, but imparts its wisdom in a straightforward and practical m an­
ner. Fundamentally, I believe that is the essence of the science of logistics. Every
element of our complex logistical environment is captured in this book with new
sections including: segmented supply chain strategy, supply chain investment
decisions, global governance, a wide range of agile practices and corporate social
responsibility - all adding to the rich content.
In introducing this collaboration between Alan and Remko, and now Heather,
my parentage springs to mind. This was another Anglo-Dutch partnership, albeit
with different outcomes!
I have spent the last 30 years in logistics, working in both British and Dutch
environments. The last 15 of these years have been in a global role. I was fortunate




to work with Alan for m any years and it was a terrible loss to the world of supply
chain when Alan sadly passed away but this book is part of a tremendous legacy
which he left to us all.
The output of Alan's, Remko's and Heather's collaboration rings true in so
many areas and offers methods and approaches that will continue to drive our
improvements in the coming years.

Preface
Logistics has been emerging from Peter Drucker's shadowy description as 'the
economy's dark continent' for some years. From its largely military origins, lo­
gistics has accelerated into becoming one of the key business issues of the day,
presenting formidable challenges for managers and occupying some of the best
minds. Its relatively slow route to this exalted position can be attributed to two
causes. First, logistics is a cross-functional subject. In the past, it has, rightly,
drawn on contributions from marketing, finance, operations and corporate strat­
egy. W ithin the organisation, a more appropriate description would be a busi­
ness process, cutting across functional boundaries yet with a contribution from
each. Second, logistics extends beyond the boundaries of the organisation into
the supply chain. Here, it engages with the complexities of synchronising the
m ovement of materials and information between many business processes. The
systems nature of logistics has proved a particularly difficult lesson to learn, and
individual organisations still often think that they can optimise profit conditions
for themselves by exploiting their partners in the supply chain. Often they can in the short term. But winners in one area are matched by losers in another, and
the losers are unable to invest or develop the capabilities needed to keep the
chain healthy in the long term. The emergence of logistics has, therefore, been
dependent on the development of a cross-functional model of the organisation,
and on an understanding of the need to integrate business processes across the
supply network.
Whilst its maturity as a discipline in its own right is still far from complete, we
believe that it is time to take a current and fresh look at logistics management
and strategy. Tools and concepts to enable integration of the supply chain are
starting to work well. Competitive advantage in tomorrow's world will come from
responding to end-customers better than competition. Logistics plays a vital role
in this response, and it is this role that we seek to describe in this book.
The globalisation of logistics assumes that quality can be duplicated anywhere,
that risks are relatively small, and that sustainability does not really matter. Case
study 4.2 quotes an environmental activist as saying, 'We are producing food in
one corner of the world, packing it in another and then shipping it somewhere
else. It's mad.' The reality is that 21st-century supply chains are developing very
different profiles from those developed by the mindsets of 10 or 20 years ago. Risk
will become more important. Plans will need to be in place to prevent or mitigate
the impact of financial, operational and political uncertainty. It is both environ­
mentally and economically right to focus on sustainability. Logistics stands at the
heart of this debate.
This text has a clear European foundation (its currency is the euro) and an in­
ternational appeal. In line with the globalisation of logistics, we have included
cases from other parts of the world than Europe - diverse though European logis­
tics solutions are - including South Africa, the United States, Japan, China and
Australia.




Accordingly, we start in Part One with the strategic role of logistics in the sup­
ply chain. We continue by developing the marketing perspective by explaining
our view of 'putting the end-customer first'. Part One finishes by exploring the
concept of value and logistics costs. In Part Two, we review leveraging logistics
operations in terms of their global dimensions, and of the lead-time frontier. Part
Two continues by examining the challenges of coordinating manufacturing and
retail processes, and the impact on logistics of just-in-time and the agile supply
chain. Part Three reviews working together, first in terms of integrating the sup­
ply chain and second in terms of sourcing and supply management. Our book
ends with Part Four, in which we outline the logistics future challenge.
This text is intended for MSc students on logistics courses, and as an accompa­
nying text for open learning courses such as global MSc degrees and virtual uni­
versities. It will also be attractive as a managem ent textbook and as recommended
reading on MBA options in logistics and supply chain management.
In the second edition, we listened carefully to students and to reviewers alike
and set out to build on the foundation of our initial offering. We updated much
of the material whilst keeping the clear structure and presentation of the first
edition. There were lots of new cases and we updated others. We attempted to
touch on many of the exciting developments in this rapidly expanding body of
knowledge, such as governance councils, the prospects for a radio frequency iden­
tification device (RFID) and the future of exchanges.
The third edition retained the clarity and up-to-date content that have become
hallmarks of the previous editions. It continued to provide further new and up­
dated cases to illustrate developments in the subject. Chapters 6, 7 and 10 were
largely reconstructed, but we also made many improvements to other chapters
resulting from our research and work with industrial partners.
The fourth edition built on the foundations we had developed so far, whilst
continuing to update the content and keep it abreast of the rapidly developing
logistics body of knowledge. Many of the cases were updated too and new ones
introduced. Chapters 6 and 7 were again largely reconstructed, and we refocused
Chapter 9 around sourcing and supply management. We continued to develop
the them e of sustainable logistics, which we classify as a competitive priority
right from the start.
We worked with Alan on the fifth edition before his death, after which we con­
tinued without his direct intervention, but very m uch within his guidance. This
edition carries forward the healthy tradition established for this book by further
developing areas on the basis of the latest research and providing cases to illus­
trate practice. In response to reviewers we have further developed the alignment
between marketing and supply chain culminating in a new expanded section
on segmented supply chain strategy in Chapter 2. We also took the opportu­
nity to reconstruct and expand Chapter 3 on value and logistics costs, equipping
the reader with the latest thinking on improving liquidity through supply chain
management and approaches to making capital investment decisions. Risk readi­
ness in Chapter 4 has also been updated in the light of recent food scares, such
as the horsemeat scandal. Related to this, a new section has also been added to
Chapter 4 to address the global governance of supply chains.


Agility is not new but the concept has developed across organisational and re­
lational practices. Chapter 7 has been reconstructed and expanded to reflect the
body of knowledge now available on supply chains able to respond to unpredict­
able demand. Chapter 10 reflects the changing future and revisits corporate so­
cial responsibility from the perspective of supply chain trade-offs. Humanitarian
logistics is also a new section here, which is in response to the growing number
of hum anitarian crises - both political and natural - and the need for existing
supply chain strategies to be applied to save lives! As with all previous editions,
many of the cases have been updated and new ones introduced. In response to
reviewers, we have introduced more global cases, such as the Li & Fung case and
also food supply chain cases.
We are grateful to Paul Mayhew of Johnson Matthey (formerly at Bausch
& Lomb), who has once again written the foreword. We are also indebted to
Catherine Maryon, who has provided a personal foreword for this book to pay
tribute to our beloved colleague and friend Professor Alan Harrison, who passed
away in 2012. We will always miss Alan, and we are proud to take the book
forward as if he was still by our side.
We hope that our book will offer support to further professional development in
logistics and supply chain management, which is needed today more than ever be­
fore. In particular, we hope that it encourages you to challenge existing thinking, and
to break old mindsets by creating a new and more innovative future. Transforma­
tion of supply chains is a focus for everyone in the 21st century. Since we launched
this textbook in 2001, it has become a European best seller - and is popular in
Australia, Singapore and South Africa. It is also developing an important following
in the United States. Our book has also been launched in local language formats in
Japan, Brazil, Russia, China, Poland, Mongolia and the Ukraine.






Authors' acknowledgements
We should like to acknowledge our m any friends and colleagues who have
contributed to our thinking and to our book. Cranfield colleagues deserve a spe­
cial mention: Dr Janet Godsell (now at Warwick Manufacturing Group), Dr Carlos
Mena, Dr Simon Templar, Dr Silvia Rossi, Dr Paul Chapm an (now at Saïd Busi­
ness School), Dr Paul Baines and Professor Richard Wilding have all made im­
portant contributions. Sri Srikanthan helped us with the financial concepts in
Chapter 3. Members of the Agile Supply Chain Research Club at Cranfield also
deserve special mention, notably Stuart Bailey of Brakes Group (formerly of Kim­
berley Clark), Simon Marshall of Travis Perkins, Paul Mayhew of Johnson Matthey
(who provides the foreword for the new edition), Ian Shellard and David Evans
of Rolls-Royce, Mark Baker of Pentland Brands (who updated Case study 4.4 and
Case study 8.4) and Joe Thomas of Tesco (who updated Case study 1.1). Other
individuals who have provided information for cases include David Spacey of
Heineken, who assisted with Case study 10.1 and Stephane Guelat of Eaton Cor­
poration who supported Case study 9.5. We have picked the brains of several
who have recently retired from the industry, including David Aldridge (formerly
of Cussons UK) and Philip Matthews (formerly of Boots the Chemist). A number
of professors from other universities have contributed ideas and cases, including
Corrado Ceruti (University of Roma), Tor Vergata, Marie Koulikoff-Souviron
(SKEMA Business School, Nice), Jacques Colin (CretLog, Aix-en-Provence),
Konstantinos Zographos (Athens University of Economics and Business),
Huo Yanfang (University of Tianjin), Thomas Choi (Arizona State University) and
David Bennett (Newcastle Business School). Many of our MSc graduates, such as
Steve Walker and Alexander Oliveira, also made im portant contributions. Profes­
sor Yemisi Bolumole (Michigan State University) helped us to redraft earlier ver­
sions of the first edition. Dr Jim Aitken (University of Surrey) contributed to our
supply chain segmentation thinking in Chapter 2, and we have used his work on
supplier associations in Chapter 8. We also acknowledge the encouragement of
Kate Brewin at Pearson Education in the preparation of this text - and to meet
deadlines! Also, we thank the reviewers who made many valuable comments
on earlier editions of this book. We are very grateful to all of these, and to the
many others who made smaller contributions to making this book possible. Cathi
Maryon helped to research several of the cases. Finally, we thank Lynne Wall for
helping wherever she could - in addition to helping to run our Supply Chain
Research Centre at Cranfield!

How to use this book
This book is divided into four parts, centred on a model for logistics. The model
for logistics is introduced in the first chapter of Part One, which places logistics in
terms of its contribution to competitiveness, customer service and the creation of
value. Part Two of the book focuses on leveraging logistics operations within the
context of quality of service and cost performance objectives. Part Three focuses
on working together, and Part Four pulls together four elements of leading-edge
thinking in logistics, hom ing in on future challenges for the subject.

The book has been arranged to take you through the subject in logical stages.
The limitation of a text presentation is that the subjects are then arranged in
sequence, and links between stages have to be made by the reader. We have set
out to facilitate cross-linkages by including:
• activities at the end of m any of the sections, which are aimed at helping you to
think about the issues raised and how they could be applied;
• discussion questions at the end of each chapter to help you assess your under­
standing of the issues raised, and give you practice in using them;
• case studies, which draw together a number of issues and help you to think
about how those issues are linked together in a practical setting. Use the study
questions at the end of each case to guide your thinking.
We have sought to break up the text with figures, tables, activities and case stud­
ies, so rarely will you find two successive pages of continuous text. You should,
therefore, regard the activities and case studies as an integral part of the m ethod
used in this book to help you to learn.




Where possible, discuss the activities and case study questions in groups after
you have prepared them individually. Discussion helps to broaden the agenda
and create confidence in handling the issues. Whilst you are studying this book,
think about the logistics issues it raises - in your own firm or ones that you know
well, and in articles in newspapers such as the Financial Times and magazines
such as Business Week. Follow up the website addresses we have included in the
text and again link them with the issues raised in the book.
A few words on terminology are appropriate here. We have taken the view that
logistics and supply chain management (SCM) are sufficiently different for sepa­
rate definitions to be needed. We have included these definitions in Chapter 1:
logistics is a subset of SCM. 'Supply chain' and 'supply network' are used inter­
changeably, although we favour 'chain' for a few organisations linked in series
and 'network' to describe the more complex inter-linkages found in most situa­
tions. Again, our position is explained in Chapter 1.
A summary is provided at the end of each chapter to help you to check that
you have understood and absorbed the m ain points in that chapter. If you do not
follow the summary points, go back and read the relevant section again. If need
be, follow up on references or suggested further reading. Summaries are also there
to help you with revision.
We have designed this book to help you to start out on the logistics journey
and feel confident with its issues. We hope that it will help you to improve supply
chains of the future.

Part One
COMPETING THROUGH
LOGISTICS
Our model of logistics structures the supply network around three main factors: the
flow of materials, the flow of information and the time taken to respond to demand
from source of supply. The scope of the network extends from the 'focal firm ' at the
centre across supplier and customer interfaces, and therefore typically stretches across
functions, organisations and their borders. The network is best seen as a system of
interdependent processes, where actions in one part affect those of all others. The
key 'initiator' of the network is end-customer demand on the right: only the endcustomers are free to make up their mind when to place an order. After that, the
system takes over.
Chapter 1 explains how networks are structured, the different ways in which they
may choose to compete, and how their capabilities have to be aligned with the needs
of the end-customer. Chapter 2 places the end-customer first in logistics thinking, and
develops the theme of aligning logistics strategy with marketing strategy. Chapter 3
considers how value is created in a supply network, how logistics costs can be man­
aged, and how a balanced measurement portfolio can be designed.

Introduction
It takes only 17 hours or so to assemble a car, and a couple more days are needed
to ship it to the customer via the dealers. So why does it take more than a m onth
for a manufacturer to make and deliver the car I want? And why are the products
I want to buy so often unavailable on the shelf at the local supermarket? These
are questions that go to the heart of logistics management and strategy. Supply
chains today are slow and costly in relation to what they will be like in the future.
But let us start at the beginning, by thinking about logistics and the supply chain
in terms of what they are trying to do. It is easy to get bogged down in the
complexities of how a supply chain actually works (and very few people actually
know how a whole supply chain works!). We shall address many of these details
later in this book. First, let us focus on how a supply chain competes, and on what
the implications are for logistics management and strategy.
The overall aim of this chapter is to provide an introduction to logistics and to
set the scene for the book as a whole. The need is to look outside the individual
organisation and to consider how it aligns with other organisations in a given
supply chain. This is both a strategic and a managerial task: strategic, because
it requires long-term decisions about how logistics will be structured and the




systems it will use; managerial, because it encompasses decisions about sourcing,
making and delivering products and services within an overall 'game plan'.
This ch ap te r addresses fo u r key issues:
1 Logistics and th e supply chain: de fin itio n s, structure, tie rin g .
2 M a te ria l flo w and in fo rm atio n flow : th e s u p p ly chain and th e d e m a n d chain.
3 C o m p etin g th ro u g h logistics: c o m p e titiv e criteria in th e m arketplace.
4 Logistics strategies: a lig n in g capabilities across th e su p p ly chain.

1.1 Logistics and the supply chain
Key issues: W h a t is th e supply chain, and h o w is it structured? W h a t is th e purpose
o f a supply chain?

Logistics is a big word for a big challenge. Let us begin by giving an example of
that challenge in practice, because that is where logistics starts and ends.

CASE STUDY

1.1

Tesco PLC
Tesco PLC is the UK's largest food retailer, w ith a revenue of about £65 billion (ex­
cluding the Tesco Bank business) fo r the financial year 2 0 1 2 -1 3 . As illustrated by
Table 1.1, Tesco has grow n in to a global business since the m id-1990s and now has
approxim ately 7,000 stores across 12 countries in the USA, Central Europe and Asia,
em ploying over 530,000 people. The num ber o f stores in the UK alone has risen rap­
idly from 2,300 in 2010 to 3,146 in 2013, in part due to the opening o f fu rth e r Tesco
Express stores (smaller convenience stores), 54 of w hich opened over a 6 -m onth
period in 201 3. W hilst Tesco PLC is now undeniably global, w ith more than half of
the stores outside the UK, the UK business still dominates, accounting fo r around
tw o thirds o f the revenue. W ith this in m ind, the rem ainder o f this case focuses on
Tesco UK.
Tesco states th a t its new core purpose is 'we make w h a t matters better, together'.
This reflects th a t society desires business to demonstrate th a t it has a purpose beyond
p ro fit - a sense th a t large companies should be co n tributing more to tackling some
of the big challenges. The w orld has changed from a culture of 'm ore is better' to
one o f 'm aking w ha t matters better'. As a responsible corporate citizen in the area of
logistics alone, Tesco is the UK's market leader in the use of biofuels and works hard to
reduce its C 0 2 emissions per case delivered, through initiatives including rail, barge
and alternative fuels. The com pany also buys considerable numbers of double-deck
trailers to move more cases per trip.
Consistent w ith the m ulti-channel approach (discussed in Section 2.1.2), Tesco UK
operates an online Tesco store (Tesco.com), where its full range of products, estimated
at around 75,000, is available. Indeed, now 50 cities outside the UK have access to

this service. Through this grow ing channel, products can be delivered direct to the
customer's home or, by using 'Click and Collect', the custom er nominates a convenient
Tesco store (or drive-through) from w hich to collect their shopping. Whilst, typically,
Tesco online orders are 'picked' from stores open to customers (rather than distribution
centres), Tesco UK is beginning to establish 'd ot-co m -o n ly' stores, and in 2013 five such
stores had been opened.
The p ro d u ct range held by the stores has g ro w n rapidly in recent years as Tesco
broadens its presence in the non -fo o d m arket fo r electrical goods, stationery,
c lo th in g and the like. This massive range is supported by thousands o f suppliers,
w h o are expected to m eet agreed service levels (correct tim e and quantities) by
delivering to Tesco w ith in specific tim e 'w in d o w s '. In England alone 270 suppliers
are supplying over 1,250 products each. Volumes are impressive w ith over 2 billion
cases o f p ro d u c t shipped fro m suppliers to the stores each year. Indeed, p a rt o f the
Tesco business m odel is a virtuous circle w here Tesco develops economies o f scale,
w hich allows it to invest in offers fo r customers, w hich in tu rn leads to Tesco selling
m ore, and so on.
So how does Tesco m aintain high availability o f so many product lines in so many
stores? This question goes to the heart of logistics managem ent fo r such a vast organi­
sation. Logistics is about material flow, and about inform ation flow. Let us look at how
Tesco deals w ith each of these in turn.




M a te r ia l flo w fr o m suppliers to stores
An early reform fo r supermarket operation was to have suppliers deliver to a depot
rather than to every store. During the 1980s, distribution to retail stores was handled
by 26 depots, w hich operated on a single-temperature basis, and were small and
relatively inefficient. Delivery volumes to each store were also relatively low, and it
was n o t economic to deliver to all stores each day. Goods th a t required tem peraturecontrolled environments had to be carried on separate vehicles. Each product group
had different ordering systems. The netw ork of depots simply could n o t handle the
g ro w th in volumes and the increasingly high standards o f tem perature control. A new
distribution strategy was needed.
M any small depots w ith lim ited tem perature control facilities were replaced by fresh
food depots w hich can handle many products at several tem perature ranges. The
o p p o rtu n ity is to provide a cost-effective daily delivery service to all stores. Typically,
a fresh food d e pot can handle over 80 m illion cases per year on a 40-acre site. The
warehouse building comprises 36,000 square metres divided into 3 tem perature zones:
-2 5 °C (frozen), 1°C (chilled) and 12 ºC (sem i-am bient). Each d e pot serves a group of
between 50 and 500 retail stores. Delivery vehicles fo r fresh food depots use insulated
trailers divided into chambers by means of movable bulkheads so they can operate
at different temperatures. Deliveries are made at agreed, scheduled times using a
com bination o f inhouse and outsourced logistics. Grocery and non-food goods, such as
cans and clothing, are delivered separately.
In recent years Tesco has established fo u r store formats - Extra, Superstore, M etro
and Express - w hich vary dram atically in size from 5,500 square metres (Extra) to
280 square metres (Express), stock accordingly varying product ranges and are located
in different locations from o u t o f to w n (Extra) to city centre (Express). This diversifica­
tion presents m ajor challenges to supply chain management. For instance, delivering to
a Tesco Express in the m iddle o f London w ill require frequent small deliveries using small
vans facing restrictions in delivery times. On the other hand, a Tesco Extra w ill require
lorry load deliveries of a much w ider product range (Tsinopoulos and Mena, 2010).

In fo r m a tio n flo w
So much fo r the m ethod o f transporting goods from supplier th rough to the stores,
b u t how much should be sent to each store? W ith such a huge product range today,
it is impossible fo r the individual store to re-order across the w hole range (store-based
ordering). Instead, sales of each product line are tracked continuously th rough the till by
means o f electronic p o in t of sale (EPOS) systems. As a customer's purchases are scanned
through the barcode reader at the till, the sale is recorded autom atically fo r each stock­
keeping unit (SKU). Cumulative sales are updated every fo u r hours on Tesco Inform ation
Exchange (TIE). This is a system based on internet technology th a t allows Tesco and its
suppliers to com m unicate trading inform ation. The aim of im proved com m unication is
to reduce response times from manufacturer to stores and to ensure pro d u ct availability
on the shelf. A m ongst other things, TIE aims to im prove processes fo r introducing new
products and prom otions, and to m o n ito r service levels.
Based on cumulative sales, Tesco places orders w ith its suppliers by means of electronic
data interchange (EDI). As volumes and product ranges increased during the 1990s,
food retailers such as Tesco aimed to de-stock their depots by ordering only w h a t was


needed to meet tom orrow 's forecast sales. For fast-m oving products such as types of
cheese and washing powders, the aim is day 1 for day 2: th a t is, to order today w ha t is
needed fo r tom orrow . For fast-moving products, the aim is to pick to zero in the depot:
no stock is left after store orders have been fulfilled. This means th a t the same space in
the d e pot can be used several times over. Deliveries to stores are made in tw o waves, at
specific times and w ith in defined w indows. This helps to im prove product availability at
stores th ro u g h o u t the day, and thus support changes in demand.

Q uestions
1 Describe the key logistics processes at Tesco UK.
2 W hat do you think are the main logistics challenges in running the Tesco UK operation?

So why has Tesco grown in an intensely competitive market? Tesco has to u n ­
derstand customer needs and how they can be served. Its products must be recog­
nised by its customers as representing outstanding value for money. To support
such goals, it must ensure that the products that its customers want are available
on the shelf at each of its stores, and online, at all times, day and night. Logistics
is the task of planning and controlling the purchase and distribution of Tesco's
massive product range from suppliers to stores. Logistics is concerned with m an­
aging two key flows:
• material flow of the physical goods from suppliers through the distribution cen­
tres to stores and for the online business through to the end-customer;
• information flow of demand data from the end-customer back to purchasing
and to suppliers, and supply data from suppliers to the retailer, so that material
flow can be planned and controlled accurately.
The logistics task of managing material flow and information flow is a key
part of the overall task of supply chain management. Supply chain management is
concerned with managing the entire chain of processes, including raw material
supply, manufacture, packaging and distribution to the end-customer. The Tesco
UK supply chain comprises three main functions:
• distribution: the operations and support task of managing Tesco's distribution
centres (DCs), the distribution of products from the DCs to the associated
stores and, in the case of the online offering, delivery to the end-customer;
• network and capacity planning: the task of planning and implementing sufficient
capacity in the supply chain to ensure that the right products can be procured
in the right quantities now and in the future;
• supply chain development: the task of improving Tesco's supply chain so that
its processes are stable and in control, that it is efficient, and that it is cor­
rectly structured to meet the logistics needs of material flow and inform ation
flow.




Thus logistics can be seen as part of the overall supply chain challenge. Whilst
the terms ‘logistics' and 'supply chain managem ent' are often used interchange­
ably, logistics is actually a subset of supply chain management. It is time for some
definitions.

1.1.1

Definitions and concepts
A supply chain as a whole ranges from basic commodities (what is in the
ground, sea or air) to selling the final product to the end-customer, to recycling
the used product. Material flows from raw materials (such as a bauxite m ine as
a source of alum inium ore) to the finished product (such as a can of cola). The
can is recycled after use. The analogy to the flow of water in a river is often used
to describe organisations near the source as upstream, and those near the endcustomer as downstream. We refer to firms that are involved in supply chains as
partners, because that is w hat they are. There is a collective as well as an indi­
vidual role to play in the conversion of basic com m odity into finished product.
At each stage of the conversion, there may be returns, which could be reject
material from the preceding firm, or waste such as the finished can that needs
to be recycled. Sometimes, the whole product is wasted because the consumer
throws it away.
A supply chain is a network of partners w ho collectively convert a basic commodity
(upstream) into a finished product (downstream) that is valued by end-customers,
and who manage returns at each stage.

Each partner in a supply chain is responsible directly for a process that adds
value to a product.
A process transforms inputs in the form of materials and information into outputs
in the form of goods and services.

In the case of the cola can, partners carry out processes such as mining, trans­
portation, refining and hot rolling. The cola can has greater value than the bauxite
(per kilogram of aluminium).
Supply chain m anagem ent (SCM) involves planning and controlling all of the
processes from raw material production to purchase by the end-user to recycling
of the used cans. Planning refers to making a plan that defines how m uch of
each product should be bought, made, distributed and sold each day, week or
m onth. Controlling means keeping to plan - in spite of the m any problems
that may get in the way. The aim is to coordinate planning and control of each
process so that the needs of the end-customer are m et correctly. The definition
of SCM used in this book is adapted from the Council of SCM Professionals
(CSCMP, 2010):
SCM encompasses the planning and controlling of all processes involved in pro­
curement, conversion, transportation and distribution across a supply chain. SCM
includes coordination and collaboration between partners, which can be suppliers,
intermediaries, third party service providers, and customers. In essence, SCM inte­
grates supply and demand management within and between companies in order to
serve the needs of the end-customer.


'Serve the needs of the end-customer' has different implications in different
contexts. In not-for-profit environments, such as public health and local gov­
ernment, serving implies 'continuously improving', 'better than other regions/
countries', 'best value', and the like. In the commercial sector, serving implies
'better than competition', 'better value for money', and so on. In either situation,
the focus of managing the supply chain as a whole is on integrating the processes
of supply chain partners, of which the end-customer is the key one. In effect,
the end-customer starts the whole process by buying finished products. It is the
buying behaviour of the end-customer that causes materials to flow through the
supply chain. This shall be explored later in Chapter 2.
The degree to which the end-customer is satisfied with the finished product
depends crucially on the managem ent of material flow and information flow
along the supply chain. If delivery is late, or the product has bits missing, the
whole supply chain is at risk from competitors who can perform the logistics task
better. Logistics is a vital enabler for supply chain management. We use the fol­
lowing definition of logistics in this book:
Logistics is the task of coordinating material flow and information flow across the
supply chain to meet end-customer needs.

Logistics has both strategic (long-term planning) and managerial (short- and
medium-term planning and control) aspects. Tesco has a clear view about the
opportunities here. A breakdown of costs in Tesco's part of the UK supply chain
(2010) is as follows:
• Supplier delivery to Tesco distribution centre (DC)

18%

• Tesco DC operations and deliver to store

28%

• Store replenishment

46%

• Supplier replenishment systems

8%

Nearly half of supply chain costs were incurred in-store. In order to reduce
these in-store costs, Tesco realised that the solution is 'to spend more upstream
and downstream to secure viable trade-offs for in-store replenishment'. If a prod­
uct is not available on the shelf, the sale potentially is lost. By integrating exter­
nal manufacturing and distribution processes with its own, Tesco seeks to serve
the needs of its customers better than its competitors. For instance, ensuring all
products are supplied in retail-ready packaging (RRP) and merchandisable units
(MUs) to simplify and improve the speed of shelf replenishment and reduce costs.

1.1.2 Supply chain: structure and tiering
The concept of a supply chain suggests a series of processes linked together to
form a chain. A typical Tesco supply chain is formed from five such links.
In Figure 1.1 milk is produced by a dairy cooperative and shipped to a cheese
factory. Once made, the cheese is shipped to the manufacturer's national distribu­
tion centre (NDC), where it is stored and matured for nine months. It can then
be shipped in response to an order from the retailer, and is transported first to the
retailer's regional distribution centre (RDC). From there, it is shipped to the store.





Figure 1.1

From cow to customer

Looking at the arrows in Figure 1.1, material flows from left to right. Information
is shared across the chain: it is demand from the end-customer that makes the
whole chain work.
If we look more closely at what happens in practice, the term 'supply chain'
is somewhat misleading in that the 'chain' represents a simple series of links
between a basic com m odity (milk in this case) and a final product (cheese).
Thus the cheese m anufacturer will need packaging materials such as film, labels
and cases. Cheese requires materials additional to milk in the m anufacturing
process. So the manufacturer deals with suppliers other th an the milk coopera­
tive alone. Once made, the cheese is dispatched for m aturation to the supplier's
NDC, and then dispatched to m any customers in addition to Tesco. Once at a
Tesco RDC, the 'chain' spreads again because up to 100 stores are served by a
given RDC. The additional complexity prompts m any authors to refer to supply
networks rather than supply chains, a point we return to shortly. Logistics today
is also concerned with what happens after a product has been sold. Two major
concerns are:
• Reverse logistics: the return of unwanted goods and packaging in the opposite
direction (from right to left) to the normal flow shown in Figure 1.1.
• Waste: the discarding of product at any stage in the supply chain due to quality
problems - for example, the disposal of out-of-date or damaged stock by a
retailer or by an end-customer. We consider waste more generally in Chapter 6
under 'just-in-time' scheduling and in Chapter 7 under 'lean' supply chain
strategies.
A more realistic representation of the supply chain is shown in Figure 1.2,
where each link can connect with several others. A focal firm is shown at the cen­
tre of many possible connections with other supplier and customer companies.
The supply chain can be seen in this diagram as a num ber of processes that
extend across organisational boundaries. The focal firm is embedded within the
chain, and its internal processes must coordinate with others that are part of the
same chain. Materials flow from left (upstream) to right (downstream). If every­
thing is as orderly as it seems, then only the end-customer (to the extreme right
of the chain) is free to place orders when he or she likes: after that, the system
takes over.



Figure 1.2

Supply network

(Source: After Slack, e t al., 1997)

The supply chain is tiered, in that inbound and outbound can be organised into
groups of partners with which we deal. Thus, if we place an assembler such as the
Ford plant at Valencia as the focal firm, inbound logistics comprises tier 1 suppliers
of major parts and subassemblies that deliver directly to Ford, whilst tier 2 suppliers
deliver to the tier 1s, and so on. Outbound logistics covers the supply by the Ford
Valencia plant to national sales companies as tier 1 customers, which in turn supply
to main dealers at tier 2, and so on. Internal logistics covers the planning and control
of parts movements within the Ford Valencia plant. The ultimate aim of supply
chain management is to integrate inbound, outbound and internal logistics into a
seamless whole, focused on meeting end-customer needs with no waste.
Other terms that are used to describe aspects of managing the supply chain are:
• Purchasing and supply deals with a focal firm's immediate suppliers (upstream).
• Physical distribution: the task of distributing products to tier 1 customers
(downstream).
• Logistics refers to management of materials and information flows (as defined
on page 9). Inbound logistics deals with links between the focal firm and its
upstream suppliers, whilst outbound logistics refers to the links between the
focal firm and its downstream customers. Internal logistics deals with planning
and control of material flow w ithin the boundaries of the focal firm.
Supply chain m anagement thus appears as the 'end to end' (or 'cow to cus­
tomer' as we have expressed it in Figure 1.1) m anagement of the network as a
whole, and of the relationships between the various links. The essential points
were summarised long ago by Oliver and Webber (1982):
• Supply chain management views the supply chain as a single entity.
• It demands strategic decision making.




• It views balancing inventories as a last resort.
• It demands system integration.
A natural extension of this thinking is that supply chains should be viewed
rather as networks. Figure 1.3 shows how a focal firm can be seen at the centre
of a network of upstream and downstream organisations. This network forms the
centre-piece of our model of logistics (page 1).

Figure 1.3

A network of organisations

The terms 'supply chain' and 'supply network' both attem pt to describe the
way in which buyers and suppliers are linked together to serve the end-customer.
'Network' describes a more complex structure, where organisations can be crosslinked and there are two-way exchanges between them; 'chain' describes a
simpler, sequential set of links (Harland et al., 2001). We have used the terms in­
terchangeably in this book, preferring 'chain' to describe simpler linear sequences
of a few organisations and 'network' where there are m any organisations linked
in a more complex way.
Figure 1.3 takes a basic view of the network, with a focal firm linked to three
upstream suppliers and three downstream customers. If we then add material
flow and information flow to this basic model, and place a boundary around the
network, Figure 1.4 shows the network in context. Here, we have added arrows
showing the logistics contribution of material and information flows, together

Figure 1.4

The network in context


with the time dimension. Material flows from primary manufacture (for example,
farming, m ining or forestry) through various stages of the network to the endcustomer. Material flow represents the supply of product through the network in
response to demand from the next (succeeding) organisation. Information flow
broadcasts demand from the end-customer to preceding organisations in the net­
work. The time dimension addresses the question 'How long does it take to get
from primary source to the end-customer?' That is, how long does it take to get
the product through the various stages from one end of the supply chain to the
other? Time is im portant because it measures the speed with which a given net­
work can respond to demand from the end-customer. In fact, the concept of flow
is based on time:
Flow measures the quantity of material (measured in input terms such as num ­
bers of components, tonnes or litres) that passes through a given network per unit
of time.

Figure 1.5 shows an example netw ork map of a chocolate bar. Draw a netw ork map showing
how your organisation, or one th a t you know well, links w ith other organisations. Explain the
upstream, downstream and internal processes as far as you can. We expect you to address at least
the first tiers of demand and supply. You w ill derive further benefit from researching additional
tiers, and by developing the linkage of relationships th a t is involved. Explain how these w ork in
practice, and how materials flo w between the different tiers.

An im portant point here is th at the supply network should be viewed as a
system. All processes w ithin the network need to be understood in terms of
how they interact with other processes. No organisation is an island: its inputs
and outputs are affected by the behaviour of other players in the network.
One powerful, disruptive player can make life very difficult for everyone
else. For example, several auto assemblers optim ise their own processes, but
disrupt those of upstream suppliers and downstream distributors. The effect
is to increase total system costs and reduce responsiveness to end-customer
demand.

1.2 Material flow and information flow
Key issue: W h a t is th e relatio n sh ip b e tw e e n m ate ria l flo w and in fo rm a tio n flow ?

As we have already seen, logistics is about managing material flow and informa­
tion flow. In this section, we examine material flow and information flow in more
detail.

1.2.1

Material flow
The aim within a supply chain is to keep materials flowing from source to endcustomer. The time dimension in Figure 1.4 suggests that parts are moved through
the supply chain as quickly as possible. In order to prevent local build-ups of
inventory, flow must be orchestrated so that parts movem ent is coordinated.
The term often used is synchronous. Caterpillar Inc. makes complex earth-moving
equipment, and there are literally thousands of com ponent parts and subassem­
blies that must come together in the final assembly processes. The vision is that
parts and subassemblies should flow continuously through the supply chain, all
orchestrated like a ballet (Knill, 1992: 54):
The goal is continuous, synchronous flow. Continuous means no interruptions, no
dropping the ball, no unnecessary accumulations of inventory. And synchronous
means that it all runs like a ballet. Parts and components are delivered on time, in
the proper sequence, exactly to the point they're needed.

Often it is difficult to see the 'end to end' nature of flow in a given supply
chain, as further discussed in Section 2.5.4. The negative effects of such difficulty
include build-ups of inventory and sluggish response to end-customer demand.
And sheer greed by the most powerful members of a supply chain often means
that it is weaker partners (notably small to medium-sized enterprises - SMEs) who
end up holding the inventories. So m anagement strategies for the supply chain
require a more holistic look at the links, and an understanding that organisa­
tional boundaries easily create barriers to flow.
Case study 1.2 describes how one company - Xerox in this case - re-engineered
material flow in its distribution system.


CASE STUDY

1.2

Xerox
Once the problems of introducing 'just-in-tim e' production systems (internal logistics)
had been solved at the Xerox plant making photocopiers a t Venray in Holland, attention
shifted towards the finished product inventory (outbound logistics). Historically, stocks
o f finished products had been 'm anaged' by tryin g to turn the sales 'ta p ' on or o ff as
stocks developed. This was characterised by the fam iliar 'feast o r fam ine' situations.
The objective o f the next move fo r Xerox became clear: making only w h a t you need
when you need it, then shipping direct to the customer. But the key question had to
be answered: just-in-tim e fo r what? The answer is - the end-customer. And customer
surveys showed th a t three types of delivery were needed:
•
•
•

C om m odity products should be delivered 'o ff the shelf'.
Middle-range products were required in five days.
Larger products th a t had to be integrated into existing customer processes and
systems had to be planned months ahead, b u t the quoted delivery date had to be
m et 100 per cent.

It was envisaged th a t this w ould lead to a radically different inventory 'profile' in the
supply chain. Figure 1.6 shows a traditional inventory profile on the left. M ost of the stock
was held in local depots w aiting fo r custom er orders. If the mix had been incorrectly
forecast, too many of the w rong products were in plentiful supply, w hilst needed prod­
ucts were unavailable. Further, a batch of replacement products w ould take a long time
to fig h t their way through the pipeline. A new 'just-in-tim e' strategy was conceived to
make the supply chain much more responsive. This strategy had a profound effect on
the inventory profile, pushing much of the inventory upstream. The closer th a t inven­
to ry is located towards the end-customer, the higher the value added - and the more
th a t it is com m itted to a given finished product specification. Instead, inventory was
held mostly fu rth e r upstream. This was a more flexible solution, where product could be
assembled finally to known orders, and where it had low er value. O f course, it has since
been possible to remove several stages of the distribution process, thereby elim inating
some of the sources of inventory altogether.

Notes: WIP = work in progress, i.e. products being worked on, but not yet ready for sale.
Shaded areas indicate days of stock: the w ider the area, the more days of stock in that position.

Figure 1.6

Xerox: the impact on inventories




For com m odity products, Xerox coined the term deliver Jl T: th a t is, the product had
to be delivered o u t of stock. Where sales forecasts are traditionally poor, the challenge
was one of flexibility, sim plicity and speed of manufacture. For m id-range products, it
was unrealistic to hold 'just-in-case' inventories of products th a t are to o complex to be
assembled quickly. Instead, finish JIT was the term coined to describe the new policy of
building semi-finished products w ith the m inim um of added value, consistent w ith be­
ing able to com plete and deliver the pro d u ct in the five-day target. Finally, build JIT was
the term used to describe the new philosophy of building larger products quickly w ithin
a defined lead time.
The im pact of the new build philosophies on the downstream supply chain processes
can be judged from Figure 1.6. W hilst the traditional inventory profile shows a maxi­
m um num ber of days of stock (shown in the shaded area) at finished product level, this
is risky. It always seems th a t demand is greatest fo r the very items th a t are n o t available!
Postponing the decision on exact specification until as late as possible in the process,
w hen we are more likely to know precisely w h a t the end-customer wants, helps to cre­
ate the much flattened inventory profile to the rig h t of the diagram. These are issues to
w hich we return in Chapter 7 under agile practices.

Q u e stio n
1 How did inventory reduction in the supply chain lead to im proved competitiveness
at Xerox?

1.2.2 Inform ation flow
As asked in the Xerox case study, just-in-time for what? It is all well and good to
get materials flowing and movements synchronised, but the 'supply orchestra'
needs to respond in unison to a specific 'conductor'. The 'conductor' in this anal­
ogy is actually the end-customer, and it is the end-customer's demand signals that
trigger the supply chain to respond. By sharing the end-customer demand infor­
m ation across the supply chain, we create a demand chain, directed at providing
enhanced customer value. Information technology enables the rapid sharing of
demand and supply data at increasing levels of detail and sophistication. The
aim is to integrate such dem and and supply data so that an increasingly accu­
rate picture is obtained about the nature of business processes, markets and endcustomers. Such integration provides increasing competitive advantage, as we
explore further in Chapter 8.
The greatest opportunities for meeting demand in the marketplace with a maxi­
mum of dependability and a m inim um of inventory come from implementing
such integration across the supply chain. A focal firm cannot become 'world class'
by itself!
Figure 1.7 gives a conceptual model of how supply chain processes (source,
make, deliver) are integrated together in order to meet end-customer demand
(based on Supply Chain Operations Reference model, SCOR®, 2010). Demand plan­
ning information ('plan') is shared across the chain rather than being interpreted


and then changed by the 'sell' process next to the market. Demand fulfilment is
also envisaged as an integrated process, as materials are moved from one process
to the next in a seamless flow. Information is the 'glue' that binds supply chain
processes together, and which coordinates planning and fulfilment. (We explain
the SCOR model in more detail in Section 3.7.)

situation is different from the above ideals?

1.3 Competing through logistics
Key issues: H o w do products w in orders in th e marketplace? H o w does logistics
c o ntrib u te to co m p etitive advantage?

There are many potentially conflicting demands on an organisation today. All
those unreasonable customers seem to want it yesterday, at lower prices and to be
compensated if it goes wrong! W ithin a given supply chain, it is im portant that
each organisation understands how each group of products competes in the mar­
ketplace, and that it aligns its capabilities with those of its partners.
A 'product' is actually a combination of the physical product (for example, a
200g pack of Camembert cheese) and its accompanying service (for example, how
it is merchandised in the store - easy to find, always available, attractive pre­
sentation, lighting, temperature). Whilst the physical product is determined by
marketing and research and development (R&D), service is influenced heavily
by logistics.
It is impossible to be outstanding at everything, and supply chain partners need
to give priority to capabilities that give each product group its competitive edge.
These are the advantages where supply chain partners 'dig in deep' by giving
priority to investment and training, and by focusing product development and




marketing efforts. They need only to match industry average performance on
other criteria. Let us now look at the competitive priorities that can be delivered
by logistics in the supply chain.
There are various ways in which products compete in the marketplace. Perhaps
a given product is something that no one else can match in terms of price. Or
maybe you offer a product that is technically superior, such as Gillette razors.
Whilst new product development has logistics implications, the key advantage
provided by logistics - as suggested in Case study 1.1 about Tesco - is availability
o f conforming product in the marketplace at low cost. Logistics supports competitive­
ness of the supply chain as a whole by:
meeting end-customer demand through supplying what is needed in the form it is
needed, when it is needed, at a competitive cost.

Logistics advantage thus shows up in the form of such competitive factors as
better product availability in the marketplace and low product obsolescence.
Defining logistics advantage means that we need to set goals that are clear, mea­
surable and quantifiable. We distinguish three 'hard objectives' for creating lo­
gistics advantage: quality, time and cost. There are three further important ways
of creating logistics advantage: controlling variability in logistics processes, dealing
with uncertainty and sustainability. We have called these 'supportive capabilities',
and they can be just as important as hard objectives. Finally, there are 'soft objec­
tives', which relate to service aspects such as the confidence customers develop in
the way the logistics operation is performed. Let us look at each of these ways of
creating advantage in turn.

1.3.1

Hard objectives
Traditional ways of competing are to offer the end-customer advantages related to
product quality, the speed with which it is delivered, and/or the price at which it
is offered. We refer to quality, time and cost as 'hard objectives' because they are
easy to measure and relatively obvious to the end-customer.
The quality advantage

The most fundam ental objective - in that it is a foundation for the others - is
to carry out all processes across the supply chain so th at the end product does
what it is supposed to do. Quality is the most visible aspect of supply chain
performance. Defects, incorrect quantities and wrong items delivered are symp­
toms of quality problems in supply chain processes that are all too apparent to
the end-customer. Such problems negatively influence customer loyalty. Robust
processes are at the heart of supply chain performance. Internally, robust pro­
cesses help to reduce costs by elim inating errors, and help to increase depend­
ability by making processes more certain. W hen quality was positioned second
to sales growth and cost, even the iconic Toyota M otor Corporation's brand
suffered - as a string of recalls and safety concerns in recent years has shown
(see, for example, Cole, 2010).


Whilst conformance quality in the factory may be controlled to defect levels
that are below 25 parts per million (ppm), a product may end up on the retailer's
shelf with between 2 and 5 per cent defects, which is 10,000 to 20,000 ppm. This
huge escalation takes place as the result of cumulative problems in successive
supply chain processes. Cases may be crushed when shrink-wrapped at the m anu­
facturer's NDC. In the back of the retail store, cases may be cut open with a sharp
knife - despite instructions to the contrary. The end-customer sees the product
on the retail shelf at its worst state of quality performance, and that is where the
buying decision is made that drives the supply chain as a whole.
In many logistics situations, 'quality of service' (addressed in detail in Section 2.4)
is concerned w ith selecting the right quantity of the right product in the right
sequence in response to customer orders. For example, store orders m ust be
picked from a range of thousands of SKUs (stock keeping units) at a Tesco RDC.
This must be carried out accurately (correct SKU, correct quantity) against tight
delivery schedules day in and day out. Pick accuracy (for example, 99.5 per cent
correct SKU and correct quantity) is used widely to measure the quality of
this operation. And increasing requirem ents for in-store efficiencies m ean
that categories of product (for example, shampoos and toothpastes) need to
be picked in a set sequence to facilitate direct-to-shelf delivery at the store.
Logistics service providers who can im plem ent and m aintain the highest
standards of service quality place themselves at an advantage over those who
cannot.
The time advantage

Time measures how long a customer has to wait in order to receive a given prod­
uct or service. Volkswagen calls this time the customer to customer lead time: that
is, the time it takes from the m om ent a customer places an order to the moment
that customer receives the car he or she specified. Such lead times can vary from
zero (the product is immediately available, such as goods on a supermarket shelf)
to m onths or years (such as the construction of a new building). Competing on
time is about survival of the fastest!
Time can be used to win orders by companies who have learnt that some cus­
tomers do not want to wait - and are prepared to pay a premium to get what they
want quickly. An example is Vision Express, which offers prescription spectacles
'in about one hour'. Technicians machine lenses from blanks on the premises.
Staff are given incentives to m aintain a 95 per cent service level against the
one-hour target. Vision Express has been successful in the marketplace by re­
engineering the supply chain so that parts and information can flow rapidly from
one process to the next. Compare this with other opticians in the high street,
who must send customer orders to a central factory. Under the 'remote factory'
system, orders typically take about 10 days to process. An individual customer
order is first dispatched to the factory. It then has to join a queue with orders from
all the other high street branches around the country. Once the order has been
processed, it must return to the branch that raised the order. Whilst this may be
cheaper to do (a central, highly productive factory serves all of the branches), it
takes much longer to process an order.




Time equally can lose orders if competitors are able to offer faster deliveries.
Whilst online shopping cannot give the immediate availability of a store, still it
can provide a fast service. Online shoppers often expect next day, or same day,
delivery and when retailers like M&S can't match their competitors on speed,
sales are lost (as described in Section 7.2.5).
The time advantage is described variously as speed or responsiveness in practice.
Speeding up supply chain processes may help to reduce the risk of obsolete or
over-aged stock in the system or to improve freshness of the end product. Indeed,
some food products are not only perishable but the quality is also highly time
dependent. For example, watercress has a shelf life of five to six days from pack­
ing and retailer requirements are such that no packed stock can be held by the
supplier, Vitacress. To ensure high levels of freshness in store, the retailers require
a six-hour lead time from placing the order to receipt of the packed watercress in
the retailers' DCs.
Time is an absolute measure, that is, it is not open to interpretation as quality
and cost are. By following a product through a supply chain, we can discover
which processes add value and which add time and cost but no value. We explore
this further in Chapter 5, which is about managing time for advantage in the
supply chain.
The cost advantage

Cost is im portant for all supply chain processes - that goes without saying and we address logistics costs in detail in Chapter 3. Low costs translate into
advantages in the marketplace in terms of low prices or high margins, or a bit of
each. Many products compete specifically on the basis of low price. This is sup­
ported from a supply chain point of view by low cost manufacture, distribution,
servicing and the like. Examples of products that compete on low price are 'own
brand' supermarket goods that reduce the high margins and heavy advertising
spend of major brands. They also perhaps cut some of the corners in terms of
product specification in the hope that the customer will consider low price to be
more im portant than m inor differences in product quality.
The pressure to reduce prices at automotive com ponent suppliers, and hence
costs to the assemblers, is intense. The assemblers have been setting annual price
reduction targets for their inbound supply chains for some years. Toyota an­
nounced demands for a 30 per cent reduction in prices on many components by
the time that new models are launched in 2013. But unless a supplier can match
reduced prices at which products are being sold by means of reduced costs, that
supplier gradually will go out of business. As a result, many suppliers are cynical
about the 'price down' policies of the assemblers. Reduced prices are the reward
of cost cutting, and that is most often a collaborative effort by several partners
in the supply chain. So suppliers are unlikely to meet Toyota's demands on their
own: 'Toyota is going to have to do a lot of work itself, by switching more quickly
to global platforms and using more common parts' (Soble, 2009). As indicated in
Section 1.1, Tesco can make only limited inroads into its in-store costs without
the help of its supply chain partners.


1.3.2 Supportive capabilities
W hilst the hard objectives listed above are always im portant to competitive
advantage, supportive capabilities can also be key to creating logistics advantage
in the marketplace. W hen there is little to choose from in terms of quality, time
or cost, supportive capabilities can make all the difference to the end-customer.
Variability refers to real and identifiable differences within a population, such
as the differences in time each patient at an optician has to wait for his or her
eyes to be tested. Uncertainty refers to our lack of knowledge: in logistics terms,
uncertainty results in us having to deal with changes that are either not known
in advance or cannot be forecast with accuracy. Sustainability addresses the
improvement of environmental, social and economic values in the design of
logistics systems.

Controlling variability: the dependability advantage

Time is not just about speed. Quality is not just about meeting defect targets.
Behind both 'hard' objectives is the need to control variability in logistics processes.
Variability undermines the dependability with which a product or service meets
target. Whilst Vision Express offers a one-hour service for prescription glasses, the
95 per cent service level is a measure of the dependability of that service against
the one-hour target. Firms that do not offer instantaneous availability need to
tell the customer - in other words to 'promise' - when the product or service will
be delivered. Delivery dependability measures how successful the firm has been
in meeting those promises. For example, the UK's Royal Mail quality of service
target, for letters posted with a 'first class' stamp, is that 93 per cent will arrive
the next working day and, in the first quarter of the financial year 2013-14,
they beat the target with a measure of 93.4 per cent (Royal Mail, 2013). It is
im portant to measure dependability in the same 'end to end' way that speed is
measured. Dependability measures are used widely in industries such as train
and air travel services to m onitor how well published timetables are met. And in
manufacturing firms, dependability is used to m onitor a supplier's performance
in such terms as:
• on time (percentage of orders delivered on time and the variability against
target);
• in full (percentage of orders delivered complete and the variability against
target);
• on quality (percentage of defects and the variability against target).
So logistics is concerned not just with the average percentage of orders delivered
on time but also with the variability. For example, a manufacturer has to cope
with the day-to-day variability of orders placed. In practice, this is more impor­
tant than the average orders placed because of the resource implications of the
peaks and troughs of demand. Case study 1.3 explores the impact of variability
on a supplier's processes.




CASE STUDY

1.3

Measuring schedule variability
A problem that is all too familiar to suppliers in the automotive industry is that of
schedule variability. A vehicle assembler issues delivery schedules to specify how many
parts of each type are required each day for the follow ing m onth. And each day a
'call-off' quantity is issued, which specifies how many the vehicle assembler actually
wants. The tw o sets of figures are not necessarily the same, although usually they add
up to the same cumulative numbers for the m onth as a whole. In other words, the
total scheduled quantities and the total call-off quantities are the same. So w hat is the
problem?
The problem is that the supplier has to cope with the variability of call-off quantities that
create huge problems for the supplier's process. Let S = Scheduled demand, and A = Actual
call-off quantity. Then the difference D between schedule and actual is given by D = S - A.
If the supplier produces to schedule, there are two possible scenarios that follow:
•
•

S > A, so the supplier will over-produce the part and end up with excess stock; or
S < A, so there is a shortfall (S - A) of parts from the supplier, unless the supplier holds
a stock of the parts, in which case it is an opportunity to reduce them.

The two conditions (S > A and S < A) therefore have different logistics implications.
Figure 1.8 shows that actual demand, totalled across four different parts at PressCo
(a supplier of pressed metal components), may be up to 1,600 units above schedule,
or 2,200 below schedule when supplying the vehicle assembler WestCo. This range has
been divided up into intervals of 100 units. The mode (0-99) indicates that S = A for a
frequency of 18 per cent of the observations.

Figure 1.8
WestCo

Distribution of differences between scheduled and actual demand for

Assuming that the distribution is roughly normal, the standard deviation (SD) is 573,
which is characteristic of the flat, wide spread of data. Figure 1.9 shows the distribution
of S - A for four similar parts from the same supplier, PressCo, but for a different vehicle
assembler, EastCo. This time, the SD for the distribution is 95, representing a much nar­
rower spread of differences than for the assembler, WestCo.

Questions

1 What are the logistics implications for PressCo to ensure high delivery reliability to
customers WestCo and EastCo?
2 What steps will the supplier need to take in order to satisfy call-off orders from WestCo?
3 If separate parts of the PressCo factory were dedicated to production for WestCo and
for EastCo, which would be the more efficient in terms of labour costs and inventory
holding?

Quality is not just about meeting target pick accuracy or target defect levels. It is
also about controlling variability. The same argument can be made about costs. The
implication of dependability for logistics is that supply chain processes need to be
robust and predictable. In Chapter 6 we develop the case for dependability in supply
chains under the themes of planning and control and just-in-time pull scheduling.
Dealing with uncertainty: the agility advantage

Dealing with uncertainty means responding rapidly to changes that affect logis­
tics processes. These changes may be unanticipated, or anticipated but not with
a high degree of accuracy. Sometimes, problems can be foreseen - even if their
timing cannot. Toyota UK manages inbound deliveries of parts from suppliers in
southern Europe by a process called chain logistics. Trailers of parts are moved in
four-hour cycles, after which they are exchanged for the returning empty trailer
on its way back from the UK. One hitch in this highly orchestrated process means
that incoming parts do not arrive just-in-time at the assembly plant. Toyota de­
mands that its suppliers, and logistics partner, plan countermeasures. This means
that alternative routes for suppliers to deliver to its Burnaston assembly plant in
the UK have been planned in advance to deal, for example, with a French channel
ferry strike at Calais. The weather is also a cause of uncertainty in logistics - for
example, it may mean that Tesco has to switch between salads and soups as the




result of a cold snap. More seriously, natural disasters, such as earthquakes, can be
devastating to supply chains but are difficult to predict either in terms of timing
or scale. Other forms of uncertainty concern events where neither the problem
nor its timing can be foreseen. Case study 1.4 provides an example of such an
event and how the manufacturer and its suppliers responded.
CASE STUDY

1.4

P&G's supply chain keeping babies dry
Consumer products giant P&G has its share of supply chain scope. In 2012 the com­
pany realised $84 billion in sales and 25 of its brands generated $1 billion or more
revenue. In order to realise this revenue, the company procures inputs worth over
$51 billion from over 75,000 suppliers, operates 140 plants around the world and over 250
shipping locations, and transports products for over 1.5 billion kilometres per year to
reach 4.6 billion consumers daily.
Needless to say, this scale and scope of the supply chain does not come w ithout risks,
and supply chain disruptions can happen anywhere, any time. For example, in the last
week of September 2012, an explosion at a Japanese chemical plant threatened to cause
a global nappy shortage. The plant in the coastal city of Himeji, operated by Nippon
Shokubai Co., is one of the world's largest producers of acrylic acid, a primary ingredi­
ent used in disposable nappies. Powerful blasts rocked the facility as firefighters tried to
control a blaze at one of the tanks containing the chemical. One firefighter died and
34 employees and first responders were injured in the blast.
Acrylic acid is a key component of superabsorbent polymers, or SAP, which absorb
large amounts of liquid. Nippon Shokubai makes roughly 20 per cent of the world's
SAP and maintains a 10 per cent global market share of acrylic acid. The plant had
been ramping up production to meet increasing global demand, especially from China,
according to Japanese media reports. Prior to the accident, the plant manufactured
460,000 tonnes of acrylic acid annually and P&G relied on Nippon Shokubai Co. for
products sold in Asia.
In the face of this disaster, P&G supply chain teams had to move quickly and consider
their options. There were tw o alternative suppliers, but these did not have sufficient
idle capacity to compensate for the productivity lost from the Nippon Shokubai
plant. Supply chain leadership connected to Nippon Shokubai immediately offered its
assistance. The company's Chief Procurement Officer flew to Japan to work w ith the
P&G crisis team to consider options and solutions. As an emergency response, a Nippon
Shokubai plant in the USA, which previously had been shut down, was restarted w ith
P&G assistance and shipments were rerouted. Adjustments were required to the supply
chain plan, including the delay of some new product introductions. But, in the end,
zero shipments to customers were missed and no nappy scarcity was experienced at
the retail level, whilst relationships between P&G and Nippon Shokubai improved and
strengthened.

Question

1 What are the key lessons from this case for dealing effectively with disruptions to the
supply chain?


The implication of uncertainty for supply chain processes is that they need to
be flexible to respond to both anticipated and unanticipated changes. Flexibil­
ity is defined as the 'ability to react or transform [supply chain processes] with
minimum penalties in time, cost and performance' (Upton, 1995). More recently,
Christopher and Holweg (2011) defined two types of flexibility:
• Dynamic flexibility: allows firms to cope with certain shifts in demand and technol­
ogy, but only within the set structure of their existing supply chain design. Mix
flexibility and volume flexibility (Slack, 1987) are key types of dynamic flexibility.
• Structural flexibility: builds flexible options into the design of the supply chain,
such as dual sourcing, sharing assets, postponement, rapid manufacture, flex­
ible labour arrangements and outsourcing.
Agility is a strategy for providing both these types of flexibility (and therefore
dealing with uncertainty) and is discussed in detail, together with specific agile
practices, in Chapter 7.
Acting responsibly: the sustainability advantage

Sustainability has been defined as 'development that meets the needs of the present
without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their needs'
(UNWCED, 1987). Logistics increasingly has been turned to in recent years because
it offers enormous potential to mitigate damage to the environment in which we
live. Many logistics decisions impact the environment - for example, sourcing
from suppliers who use renewable raw materials and who practise ethical labour
standards, and transportation modes that minimise carbon dioxide (CO2 ) emissions.
Sustainability emerges as a way of considering the environmental and social values of
business decisions alongside their economic value. This thinking gave rise to the term
'triple bottom line' (TBL, Elkington, 1997, 2004). Taking these three 'values' in turn:
• Environmental: a focal firm such as Tesco is concerned with reducing consump­
tion of non-renewable energy and materials. It is also concerned with measuring
and reducing the environmental impact of processes across the supply chain
(SC) - from cow to customer (Figure 1.1). And collection and disposal by the
end-user is also factored in - what can be done to reduce the impact of car
journeys and the disposal of waste such as packaging? TBL thinking states that
environmental polluters should not be given a free ride any more - they should
be made to pay. For example, the Australian Government introduced carbon
trading (Humphreys, 2007, compares tax versus trading): under the carbon
pollution reduction scheme, the Government requires a 5 per cent reduction
in CO 2 levels by 2020. Accreditation to the ISO 14001 series on environmental
m anagement systems is becoming increasingly influential. And the Environ­
mental Protection Agency (EPA, 2010) seeks to 'make sustainability the next
level of environmental protection by drawing on advances in science and tech­
nology, applying government regulations and policies to protect public health
and welfare, and promoting green business practices'.
• Social: large focal firms such as Nike and Wal-Mart have been forced to consider
the social contexts of the suppliers with whom they deal. Often, suppliers are
based on the other side of the world, but consumer pressure has forced such




firms to recognise their responsibility in ensuring that goods are manufactured
in socially responsible conditions - such as no child labour (see Case study 4.7).
Organisations such as the Fairtrade Foundation (2010) aim to help farmers in
developing countries:
By facilitating trading partnerships based o n equity and transparency, Fairtrade
contributes to sustainable d evelopm en t for m arginalised producers, workers and
their com m unities. Through dem onstration o f alternatives to con ven tion al trade
and other forms o f advocacy, the Fairtrade m ovem en t em pow ers citizens to cam ­
paign for an international trade system based on justice and fairness.

• Economic: this is the net value that a firm generates after social and environm en­
tal values have been taken into account. This implies making the connection
between TBL values and financial performance. The organisational changes in­
volved in recognising economic value can be wrenching and can take years to
implement. Nike - along with other premium brand companies - came under
enormous pressure from labour activists in the 1990s to adopt more sustain­
able codes of conduct in their global supply chains. For example, purchasing
teams had to be constrained from going for lowest prices from suppliers, which
threatened short-term profitability. So Nike had to 'offset any first-mover dis­
advantage by getting both its competitors and suppliers involved... it is essen­
tial to work with others to move towards the adoption of a comm on approach
to labour compliance codes, monitoring and reporting to help ensure broader
accountability across the industry as a whole' (Zadek, 2004).
Supplier Codes of Conduct (such as Cisco Systems, 2009 and Hewlett Packard,
2013) are used to 'give preference to suppliers who are socially and environm en­
tally progressive'. In other words, sustainability has become a competitive advan­
tage in its own right. Typically, now, social and environmental issues are dealt
with under the banner of Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR), which we examine
in more detail in Section 4.7. It is also further examined in Section 10.3 to show
that conventional supply chain trade-offs still hold.
Case study 1.5 describes the operation of the Marks & Spencer 'Plan A', a highly
successful CSR initiative that has proved to be, in itself, sustainable.

CASE STUDY

1.5

Plan A at Marks & Spencer
In January 2007 Marks & Spencer (M&S) launched 'Plan A', its five-year strategy to
improve the retailer's social and environmental impact. Plan A set out 100 commitments goals to be achieved by 2012 - covering climate change, raw materials, waste, health
and fair partnership. €300 million was set aside to fund the plan over the 5 years, and
14 staff applied to its delivery. Noted in particular for its comprehensive approach
and willingness to use the company's influence with customers, suppliers, investors and
politicians, the plan has been praised as an example of best practice, winning many
independent awards.
Building on Plan A's success, in 2010 it was extended to 180 commitments, almost
double the original number, to be achieved by 2015, with the ultimate goal of becom­
ing the world's most sustainable retailer. M&S claims:


'We're doing this because it's what you want us to do. It's also the right thing to
do. We're calling it Plan A because we believe it's now the only way to do business.'
In September 201 3 M&S reported that, out of the 180 commitments, 1 39 had been
achieved, with 31 on plan, 5 behind plan, 4 not achieved and 1 cancelled across the
following 7 Plan A pillars:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

Involve o u r customers in Plan A: e.g. Breakthrough Breast Cancer.
Make Plan A how we do business: e.g. free energy monitors, free home insulation.
Clim ate change: e.g. carbon labelling and energy-efficient electrical products.
Waste: e.g. recycle, reuse and reduce packaging materials.
N a tu ra l resources: e.g. reduced water usage and sustainably farmed fish.
Fair partner, e.g. supplier ethical assessments.
Health and wellbeing: e.g. reduced salt, natural colours and nutritional labelling.

Out of the four commitments not achieved, three appear to be related to consumer
demand: tripling organic food, free range food and fair trade clothing. This goes to show
that achieving some commitments ultimately depends on changing consumer demand.
Further, it has not all been plain sailing: carbon footprint reduction, as one example, has
presented several challenges to M&S. Its reported 18 per cent net reduction in greenhouse
gas emissions was based largely on the company's switch to buying electricity under
'green' tariffs - reductions that already have been counted by energy suppliers. M&S
reported gross emissions excluding this saving - which showed a 2 per cent growth
(2009). A factor in the rise was a 10 per cent increase in store size, and M&S international
air travel had also increased. Mike Barry, head of sustainable business at M&S, points out
that the company has 'decoupled' emissions growth from commercial growth, and is firm
on its commitment to reduce emissions; nevertheless this marker alone shows the conflict
between business growth and a target of reduced environmental impact.
M&S maintains that Plan A is not just another CSR ploy. Jonathon Porritt, adviser
to M&S, agrees and points to its integration through the whole company, its detailed
measurement of non-financial data and its focus on outcomes. Porritt asserts that Plan
A 'really works' for shareholders as well as other stakeholders.
So how has M&S made sure Plan A 'really works'? Feedback tells the company that
customers discern and value the Plan A difference between M&S and other retailers, and
this translates into increased foot traffic and a wider customer base. And there are savings:
increased energy efficiency; reduced fuel use; cutting food waste by discounting short
shelf-life products; recycling internally, including coat hangers; innovation in recycling/
re-use and purchasing, e.g. using PET plastic for home product filling as well as clothes;
reducing water consumption; and being a good employer, thus reducing staff turnover
and maximising payback on investment in training and good working conditions. All
this, plus a name for encouraging customers and suppliers to change their behaviour,
being a fair partner with suppliers, raising money for charity and promoting healthy
lifestyles, makes customers want to buy more from M&S. Richard Gillies, Director of
Plan A and Sustainable Business at the company, sums it up with, 'As well as saving
costs, Plan A differentiates our business and brings more customers into our stores.'

1 How has M&S made the social and environmental impacts of Plan A acceptable to
its shareholders?




1.3.3 Soft objectives
There are other ways in which logistics advantage may be gained, but these are
not so readily measurable as those listed above. They are referred to as 'soft' objec­
tives as distinct from the more easily measurable 'hard' objectives. Examples of
soft objectives are:
• confidence: queries answered promptly, courteously and efficiently;
• security: customers' information and property treated in a confidential and
secure manner.
Soft objectives need to be measured in different ways to hard objectives, such as
through customer attitude surveys.
Logistics is not the only way in which product competitiveness in the market­
place can be enhanced. The performance objectives listed above can be added to
(and in some cases eclipsed by) other ways in which products may win orders,
such as design and marketing features. No matter how good the logistics sys­
tem m ight have been, lack of an early 'clam shell' design led to the reduction of
Nokia's market share for mobile telephone handsets in Europe. Superior product
or service design - often supported by brand image - may become the dom inant
way of achieving advantage in the marketplace. Here, the logistics task is to sup­
port the superior design. BMW's supply chain is one of the most efficient there is,
mainly because its products are sold (at least in Europe) as soon as they have been
made. Finished cars do not accumulate in disused airfields across Europe, like
those of the mass producers. Finished product storage adds cost, with no value
added from an end-customer perspective.

1.3.4 Order winners and qualifiers
The relative importance of the above logistics performance objectives is usually
different for a given market segment. A helpful distinction is that between order
winners and order qualifiers (Hill, 2000):
• Order winners are factors that directly and significantly help products to win
orders in the marketplace. Customers regard such factors as key reasons for
buying that product or service. If a firm raises its performance on those fac­
tors, it will increase its chances of getting more business. Thus a product that
competes mainly on price would benefit in the marketplace if productivity
improvements enabled further price reductions.
• Order qualifiers are factors that are regarded by the market as an 'entry ticket'.
Unless the product or service meets basic performance standards, it will not
be taken seriously. An example is quality accreditation: a possible supplier to
major utilities such as PowerGen in Britain and EDF in France would not be
considered seriously without ISO 9000 certification. And delivery reliability
is a must for newspapers - yesterday's news is worthless. Note that, in both
examples, order qualifiers are order-losing sensitive: loss of ISO 9000 accredita­
tion would make it impossible to supply to major utilities, and late delivery of
newspapers would miss the market.


Order winners and qualifiers are specific to individual segments, a point we
develop in the next chapter. Table 1.2 provides an example of how two different
products made by the same manufacturer and passing through the same
distribution channel have different performance objectives. The first product
group comprises standard shirts that are sold in a limited range of 'classic' colours
and sizes. The second product group comprises fashion blouses that are designed
specially for each season in m any colours and a choice of styles with associated
designer labels.

Analysis of the order winners and qualifiers shows that the two product ranges
have very different performance criteria in the marketplace. Of the two, the range
of fashion blouses presents more logistics challenges because demand for indi­
vidual SKUs are much more difficult to forecast. It is not until the season is u n ­
der way that a picture begins to emerge about which colours are selling most in
which region of the market. The logistics challenge, therefore, is concerned with
speed of response and flexibility to changing demand. The logistics challenges
between the two ranges are quite distinctive.
Not only can order winners and qualifiers be different for different products
and services, they can also change over time. Thus, in the early phase of a new
product lifecycle, such as the launch of a new integrated circuit, the order win­
ners are availability and design performance. Price often would be a qualifier:
provided the price is not so exorbitant that no one can afford it, there is a market
for innovators who want the best-performing chip that is available. But, by the
maturity phase of the lifecycle, competitors have emerged, the next generation is
already on the stocks, and the order winners have changed to price and product




reliability. The former order winners (availability and design performance) have
changed to become order qualifiers. The logistics challenge is to understand the
market dynamics and to adjust capabilities accordingly.
The actions o f competitors are, therefore, a further influence on logistics per­
formance objectives. For example, low-price competitors are a feature of most
markets, and attem pt to differentiate themselves from the perhaps higher-grade
but pricier incumbents. Thus competitors such as Matalan have sparked funda­
mental changes in logistics strategy at M&S (see Case study 1.5). In response to
loss of sales to cheaper new entrants, M&S ditched long-standing agreements
with local UK suppliers and sourced garments from new, lower-priced suppliers
in the Far East.
Whilst the above helps to show some of the thinking in setting logistics
strategy, there are lim itations to the use of order winners and qualifiers. They
are subjective, and so provide perceived relative priorities. W hilst this creates
useful debate between marketing and logistics, it lays the foundation for more
informed strategy setting in the context of the values of other variables in
Table 1.2, such as volumes. We develop this point in Section 2.4. It is also
im portant to share understanding of these priorities w ith partners, a point that
we develop next.

1.4 Logistics strategies
Key issues: W hat is 'strategy'? How can competitive criteria be aligned within a
supply chain? How can logistics strategies be tuned to different product needs?

1.4.1

Defining 'strategy'
Strategy is about planning as distinct from doing. It is about formulating a long­
term plan for the supply chain, as distinct from solving the day-to-day issues and
problems that inevitably occur. Extending the concept of 'strategy' from Hayes
and Wheelwright (1984):
Logistics strategy is the set o f gu iding principles, driving forces and ingrained at­
titudes that help to coordinate goals, plans and policies, and w h ich are reinforced
through conscious and subconscious behaviour w ith in and betw een partners across
a network.

All too often, logistics 'strategy' is set using few such characteristics: decisions
are made piecemeal by accident, muddle or inertia. We need, however, to recog­
nise that strategic decisions may, indeed, be made by such means.
W hittington (2000) proposes four approaches to setting strategy. He starts by
suggesting different motivations for setting strategy:
• How deliberate are the processes o f strategy setting? These can range from clearly
and carefully planned to a series of ad hoc decisions taken on a day-to-day
basis.


• W h at are the goals o f strategy setting? These can range from a focus on maxi­
mising profit to allowing other business priorities such as sales growth to be
included.
If we make these two considerations the axes of a matrix, Figure 1.10 suggests four
options for crafting strategy.

Figure 1.10

Four options for crafting strategy

W hat are the implications for the way in which supply chain strategy is ap­
proached in different organisations? Following is a brief description of the four
options:
• Evolve. 'Strategy' is not something that is undertaken formally at all. 'Our strat­
egy is not to have a strategy' is a typical viewpoint. Operating decisions are
taken in relation to the needs of the moment, with financial goals as the main
guiding principle.
• Classical. Whilst financial goals are again the main guiding principle, these are
achieved through a formal planning process. This is called 'classical' because it
is the oldest and most influential option.
• Accommodate. Here, decisions are back to the day-to-day mode, but financial
objectives are no longer the primary concern. Strategy is accommodated
instead to the realities of the focal firm and the markets in which it operates.
• Systemic. This option for strategy setting sees no conflict between the ends
and means of realising business goals. Whilst goal setting takes place across
all major aspects of the business (including hum an resources, marketing and
manufacturing policies), these are linked to the means by which they will be
achieved in practice.
Logistics strategy usually demands systemic strategy setting between network
partners, who may have to coordinate order winners and qualifiers across differ­
ent market segments.




1.4.2 Aligning strategies
In Section 1.1 we showed the supply chain as a network of operating processes.
In Section 1.2 we emphasised the need to 'integrate' these processes to maxi­
mise flow and focus on the end-customer. And in Section 1.3 we saw how supply
chains can choose to compete on a range of different competitive priorities. Now
it is time to put these ideas together and show how strategies need to be aligned
across the supply chain.
If different links in the supply chain are directed towards different competi­
tive priorities, then the chain will not be able to serve the end-customer as well
as a supply chain in which the links are directed towards the same priorities.
That is the basic argum ent for alignm ent in the supply chain (Cousins, 2005).
Where the links are directed by a com m on and consistent set of competitive
criteria, then that supply chain will compete better in the marketplace than one
in which the links have different, conflicting priorities. This is the concept of
'focus'.
Focus is based on the view th at you cannot be good at everything. For
example, it is difficult to handle high volume, low cost products in the same
channel to market as low volume, high variety products, for which flexibility
is the name of the game. W hilst the assembly line is the m ethod of choice for
m anufacturing cars in volume, developm ent of prototypes for new models is
kept well away from the factory in special facilities until close to launch. This is
because the developm ent process demands quite different technical skills and
equipm ent that are better physically separated from the more routine, efficient
and repetitive assembly line. In the example of the standard shirts and fash­
ion blouses in Section 1.3, the associated operations processes would be kept
separate ('focused') for similar reasons. And the separation could be thousands
of kilometres. 'Classic' shirts could be sourced from China, where prices are
low, and long delivery lead times are not so im portant. 'Fashion' shirts may be
sourced nearer to home, because response time is key and cost is less im portant
(see Case study 8.4).
W hat happens w hen the processes are not aligned w ithin a supply chain?
Let us address that question with Case study 1.6 to show the problems that can
arise.

1.4.3 Differentiating strategies
A supply chain, then, may choose to compete on different criteria. Such criteria
in turn need to be recognised and form part of the business strategies of all the
members of a given network. The choices so made have major implications for
the operation of each member. Failure to recognise competitive criteria and their
implications for a given product or service by any member means that the supply
chain will compete less effectively. It is like playing football when the goalkeeper
makes an error and lets in a goal that should not have happened - he or she lets
the whole side down.


Talleres Auto
Talleres Auto (TA) is an SME based in Barcelona. TA attends to broken-down vehicles,
providing a roadside repair and recovery service. Two of the parts that TA frequently
uses are starters and alternators, which are obtained from a local distributor. In turn,
the local distributor orders parts from a prime distributor. Starters and alternators are
obtained from a remanufacturer, who replaces the windings and tests the products
using parts bought from a component supplier. A diagram of this part of the supply
chain is shown in Figure 1.11.

• Talleres Auto is the installer
• TA buys starters and alternators from a local distributor
• The local distributor buys from a prime distributor
• The prime distributor buys from the remanufacturer
• The remanufacturer buys components from a component supplier

Figure 1.11

The Talleres Auto supply chain

Most of TA's customers make 'distress purchases' - their car has broken down and
they want it to be fixed quickly. So TA needs a fast replacement service from the local
distributor. Whilst both the distributors recognise the need for fast replacements, the
performance of the purchasing department at the remanufacturer is measured on cost
savings. Thus the component supplier thinks that the name of the game is low cost.

Questions

1 What are the order winners and order qualifiers at TA?
2 What are the order winners and order qualifiers at the component supplier?
3 What impact on customer service is this lack of alignment likely to cause?

W hat makes a successful strategy? Five principles of strategic positioning,
related to logistics strategy, are as follows (after Porter, 1984):
• A unique value proposition: determining what makes the product/service differ­
ent from its competitors.
• A tailored supply chain: governed by consistent order winning and qualifying
criteria.
• Identify the trade-offs: by choosing not just the priorities but also what not to
do. A responsive supply chain is not compatible with an efficient supply chain
(Fisher, 1997).




• Align logistics processes: so that processes are mutually reinforcing.
• Continuity: logistics processes are improved continually and consistently over
time.

1.4.4 Trade-offs in logistics
To reinforce the issue of differentiating strategies, let us look at two commonly
used strategies that have very different logistics implications. Consider products
with different logistics priorities, such as those in Table 1.2:
• Cost: a high volume product for which dem and is relatively stable through­
out the year. W hilst subject to occasional enhancem ents, these are usually
small scale: the lifecycle is comparatively long. Forecast error is relatively
low.
• Time: a high variety product, which is designed for a given season and which
is completely redesigned for the next season. Often, it is impossible to predict
which colour or style will sell best. The product lifecycle is short, and forecast
error is relatively high.
Cost and time have quite different logistics implications. The very actions that
help to reduce costs, such as Far East sourcing, are completely the wrong strategy
when speed and responsiveness are top of the agenda. Similarly, investing in high
volume, low variety equipm ent in the factory may create efficiency and low cost,
but limit a firm's ability to offer variety and fast response times. Developing the
capability to support more of one priority (cost) hobbles the capability to support
another (time). This is the principle of trade-off in logistics: more of one thing
means less of another. Ideally, we want two separate supply chains, one focused
on cost, the other on time. This may not be fully practical because of the need
to m aintain a single European distribution centre. But logistics operations within
the DC may well be kept separate to avoid product lines where the priority is low
cost from interfering with time sensitive product lines. The same thinking may
also apply within a given product range, when everyday ('base') demand may
need to be kept separate from promotional demand. These are two examples of
the various ways in which trade-offs may apply in practice. We return to these
concepts in the next chapter.

A ctivity 1.3
1 Using the concepts from this section, analyse the supply chain support for both of the products
you analysed in Activity 1.2. What should the supply chain be (functional-efficient o r innovativeresponsive)? What is the reality, and why are the two different?
2 To what extent is there alignment of strategy in the supply chains for these two products?


Summary
How does logistics work within the supply chain?

• Supply chain management is defined as 'encompassing the planning and
controlling of all processes involved in procurement, conversion, transporta­
tion and distribution across a supply chain. SCM includes coordination and
collaboration between partners, which can be suppliers, intermediaries, third
party service providers and customers. In essence, SCM integrates supply and
demand management within and between companies in order to serve the
needs of the end-customer.'
• Logistics is defined as 'the task of coordinating material flow and information
flow across the supply chain to meet end-customer needs'.
• In a supply chain, materials flow from upstream to downstream. Demand in­
formation from the end-customer flows in the opposite direction. A focal firm
is positioned within a supply 'network', with tier 1 suppliers and tier 1 custom­
ers its immediate neighbours. Material flow measures the quantity of material
that passes through a given network per unit of time.
• A supply network is a system in which each organisation is linked to its im­
mediate neighbours. Therefore the overall performance of the network results
from the combined performance of the individual partners.
• Logistics supports competitiveness of the supply chain as a whole by meeting
end-customer demand through supplying what is needed, when it is needed,
at low cost.
What are the performance objectives of the supply chain, and how does logistics
support those objectives?
• 'Hard objectives' are quality, speed and cost because they are easy to measure

and relatively obvious to the end-customer. Briefly, quality is about doing things
right, speed is about doing things fast, and cost is about doing things cheaply.
Supporting capabilities are concerned with controlling variability (the depend­
ability advantage), dealing with uncertainty (the rapid response advantage) and
acting responsibly (the sustainability advantage). Uncertainty can be addressed
by flexibility in logistics processes - either proactively or reactively. Sustainabil­
ity is concerned with addressing the 'triple bottom line' - social, environmental
and economic values. 'Soft objectives' are service-orientated, such as security
and confidence. They are less easily measurable than hard objectives.
• Such performance objectives can be, and often are, augmented by other objec­
tives that are outside logistics. These include product superiority, innovation
and brand. Here, the logistics task is to support such performance objectives in
the marketplace.
• The relative importance of logistics performance objectives varies from one
situation to another. It can also vary over time. The concept of order winners
and qualifiers helps to prioritise the logistics task. Key influences on relative

CHAPTER 2

Putting the end-customer first

Objectives

The intended objectives o f this chapter are to:

•

develop the marketing perspective on supply chain m anagem ent and the
need for close coordination between the tw o functions;

•

explain how customer segmentation works, and to emphasise its implica­
tions for supply chain managem ent and why it is important;

•

outline the role of demand forecasting and the links with marketing;

•

explain the connection between quality of service and customer loyalty;

•

explain current approaches to supply chain segmentation and how they
can be used to align marketing and supply chain activities, whilst improv­
ing customer service and efficiencies.

By the end o f this chapter you should be able to understand:

•

how supply chains should compete by aligning supply chain strategy with
marketing strategy;

•

the importance of quality of service across logistics operations;

•

how to use logistics strategy drivers - demand, competitive and product to help redefine segments to achieve alignment between marketing and
supply chain management.

Introduction
In Chapter 1 we looked at the logistics task from the perspective of material flow
and information flow. We also saw how logistics contributes to competitive strategy
and the performance objectives by which we can measure this contribution.
But what is it that drives the need for flow in the first place? The key point to
recognise here is that it is the behaviour of the end-customer that should dictate
what happens. The end-customer starts the logistics response by buying finished
products. It is this behaviour that causes materials to flow through the supply
chain. Only end-customers should be free to make up their minds about when
they want to place an order on the network - after that, the system takes over.
Quality of service addresses the process of handing over products and services
to end-customers. It is after this process has been completed that a product/
service reaches its full value. And the handover process offers many opportunities
for adding value. Instead of picking up a product from a distributor who is remote




from the focal firm, there are opportunities during the sales transaction (for
example, help and advice in using the focal firm's products), as well as after the
sales transaction (for example, after sales service and warranty).
This chapter explores the link between marketing strategy and supply chain
strategy. There naturally exists a tension between the dem and creation objectives
of marketing and the demand fulfilment objectives of supply chain management.
For instance, marketing has a tendency to proliferate product ranges in order to
gain market share. We see this with almost any consumer product we care to
think of - toothpaste, for instance, appears in many brands, flavours, formulae,
types of packaging and sizes. From a marketing perspective, this increases visibility
of their product range whether on the store shelf or online; it also increases the
likelihood that their products will fulfil customer needs in all the m any market
segments. However, from a supply chain management perspective, variety results
in an increasing num ber of SKUs introducing greater complexity and costs, such
as increased number of suppliers and increased inventory levels, in part due to
higher number of SKUs and higher demand variability at SKU level. And product
range is just one area of tension between marketing and logistics.
Segmented supply chain strategy offers an approach to aligning logistics strategy
with marketing and, most importantly, the changing needs of the customers
and market. By having multiple supply chain strategies determined by drivers demand, competitive and product - our research suggests that efficiencies and
customer service levels can be improved simultaneously.

Key issues

This chapter addresses five key issues:
1 The marketing perspective: the im pact of rising custom er expectations and the
inform ation revolution.
2 Segmentation: existing m arketing approaches to segm entation and their im plica­
tions fo r supply chain strategy.
3 Demand profiling: different approaches to demand forecasting and the implications
fo r supply chain strategy.
4 Quality of service: the link between custom er satisfaction and custom er loyalty.
5 Segmented supply chain strategy: how we can develop m ultiple supply chain
strategies th at simultaneously im prove efficiencies and service levels. We acknowl­
edge the assistance from our colleague at Cranfield University, Dr janet Godsell
(now of Warwick M anufacturing Group), fo r sharing her extensive knowledge on
segmented supply chain strategy and her assistance w ith the respective Section 2.5.

2.1 The marketing perspective
Key issue: W hat are the marketing implications for supply chain strategy?

'Marketing' traditionally has been associated with anticipating, identifying and
satisfying customer requirements profitably. In our terms, such a definition em ­
phasises the focal firm and outbound logistics. But a more current definition


emphasises value in the context of the broader supply chain - and that includes
partners rather than just customers:
M arketing is the activity, set o f institutions, and processes for creating, com m u n i­
cating, delivering, and ex ch an g in g offerings that have value for customers, clients,
partners, and society at large.
(American M arketing Association, July 2013)

Marketing in practice comprises the plans and decisions that determine how
these processes will be carried out.
Ultimately, satisfied end-customers are seen as the only source of profit, growth
and security. The previous chief executive of Tesco PLC, Sir Terry Leahy, spoke of
harnessing customer power (2005):
The basic assum ption that customers choose - that th ey k now best w hat they
w ant - m eans that they have becom e the centre o f the retailer's universe. In the best
businesses, their decisions drive everything. These choices are also judgem ents. They
pick the w inners and losers in retail and in m anufacturing. This is n ot theoretical:
they regularly pass verdicts, m ovin g from product to product and store to store.
These judgem ents send strong feedback - shocks m ight be a better w ord - forcing
change.

Louis Gerstner (2002: 47) explained that the amazing turnaround of IBM in the
1990s was due to the fact that 'a customer was now running IBM'.
In Chapter 1, we referred to 'tier 1 customers' with whom a focal firm deals
directly, and to 'end-customers' who are the individuals or businesses that buy
the finished 'product' at the downstream end of the supply network (as illustrated
in Figure 1.2). It is therefore usual to refer to two types of customer:
• 1st tier customers: who represent the focal firm's immediate trading environ­
ment, are businesses, (unless the 1st tier is also the end-customer, in which case
these might be individual consumers);
• end-customers: who represent the ultimate customer for the network as a whole
and may be businesses or individual consumers.
We also need to distinguish here between different types of customers. Cus­
tomers are individuals or businesses who buy the product, meaning that they
acquire it and pay for it. It is usual in business today to refer to 'customers' as the
next echelon downstream in a supply chain. This includes 'all types of marketing
intermediaries or channel members who buy for resale to their customers' (Web­
ster, 2000). Consumers are a particular type of end-customer - people who use or
consume the product (Webster 2000).
Different types of customers give rise to different types of relationships, com­
monly referred to as 'business to business' (B2B) and 'business to consumer' (B2C).
In Section 1.2.2 of Chapter 1, we referred to the need to integrate supply chain
processes so that they are aligned towards end-customer needs. In this sense, B2B
integration should be aligned towards the ultimate B2C process or, in the case of
an industrial product, B2B process.
But 'satisfied customers' are increasingly hard to find. This has been caused
by widespread changes that are affecting the world we live in. Two of the major




changes are rising customer expectations and the information revolution (Doyle,
2000). We expand on these below.

2.1.1

Rising customer expectations
Expectations have risen amongst consumers in line with a general increase in the
wealth of developed countries over the last half century. This increase in expecta­
tions has many causes, including:
• better levels of general education;
• better ability to discern between alternative products;
• exposure to more lifestyle issues in the media.
These expectations have led to consumers not only aspiring to more desirable
products, they are also demanding much better levels of service to be associated
with those products.
Businesses are also expecting more from their suppliers. Suppliers need to
pay increasing attention to the service aspects of their dealings with business
customers. This is especially true when the customer has implemented more
customer-centric management systems such as just-in-time or vendor managed
inventory (Chapter 6).

2.1.2 The information revolution
The explosion in applications of internet technology continues to have sweep­
ing effects on the way that business is transacted today. Applications that have
sprung from the world wide web have impacted both B2C and B2B relationships.
Business to consumer (B2C)

Online retailing has developed rapidly in recent years, and organisations such as
Amazon.com continue to extend the range of products they offer. Many retail firms
based on the traditional 'bricks and mortar' model have fought back by launch­
ing their own websites and online catalogues. The internet has become another
channel to market for the retail industry, as home shopping accelerates in industry
sectors as diverse as books, music and furniture. This has resulted in multi-channel
retailing:
The d evelopm en t o f retail operations in such a m anner that enables the custom er to
transact w ith the business (browse, buy or return) through in d ep en d en tly m anaged
channels, in clu d in g retail stores, o n lin e stores, m obile stores, m obile app stores and
teleph one sales.
(Lockton, et al., 2013)

However, this has led to numerous logistics challenges as retailers strug­
gle to apportion and control inventories across the different channels and at
the same time provide the customer with high availability and stock visibility.


More recently, the majority of retailers are planning to make the transition to
omni-channel, according to a survey of retail boards in the UK and USA conducted
by LCP Consulting which specialises in the retail sector (Lockton, et al., 2013):
A truly integrated approach across the w hole retail operation that delivers a seamless
response to the consum er experience through all available shopping channels,
whether on m obile internet devices, computers, in store on television and in catalogue.

Regardless of the channel, the experience in terms of assortment, ease of use,
availability and delivery should be uniform with a focus on fulfilment excellence
(in terms of speed and reliability) enabled by integrated IT systems.
Business to business (B2B)

Here, the impact has been just as great as in B2C, but perhaps less visible. Busi­
nesses increasingly use web portals, online marketplaces and other collaborative
online applications to exchange information, undertake transactions (such as
buying and selling) and organise delivery and payment. These forms of inter-firm
collaboration are leading to closer integration of processes between businesses
and are helping to break down some of the traditional barriers in buyer-supplier
relationships, as discussed further in Section 8.1.3 on electronic integration.
Equally, e-auctions, where a tender is put online and suppliers are invited to bid
over a short period of time (e.g. three hours), can increase competition amongst
suppliers. Suppliers have sight of competitors' bids, thereby intensifying the com­
petition and further reducing suppliers’ prices and/or improving the service or
product quality.
Other supply chain implications

Developments in B2B and B2C exchanges also have an impact on how the supply
chain operates. The ability to exchange information more effectively and accu­
rately should enable more reliability in supply chain operations, as well as lower­
ing the costs of ordering. The availability of shared information also facilitates
improved m anagement of inventory, forecasts and use of assets. Web-enabled
data exchange facilitates replacement of inventory with information, resulting in
lower working capital.
Faced with rising customer expectations and the information revolution, sup­
ply chain partners are looking increasingly at how they can be more demand-led,
and respond more rapidly to market requirements. The starting point is to put the
end-customer first by analysing their needs and wants. The marketing perspective
has a well-known way to help in this analysis - segmentation.

2.2 Segmentation
Key issue: W hat is segmentation, and what are its implications to logistics strategy?

Segmentation describes how a given market might be broken up into different
groups of customers with similar needs. It means 'describing the market as simply
as possible whilst doing our best to emphasise its variety' (Millier and Palmer,




2000). We start by considering market segmentation from a customer perspective
in what are usually described as 'fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG)' markets.
For example, segmentation of the market for suntan creams and lotions would
begin with an understanding of:
• the benefits wanted (e.g. water resistance, oil/non-oil, sun factor);
• the price consumers are prepared to pay;
• the media to which they are exposed (television programmes, magazines,
Google ads, etc.);
• the am ount and timing of their purchases.
Profiles of the segments and evaluation of their relative attractiveness to a focal
firm can then be developed.
There are m any possible ways in which markets can be segmented, including:
• demographic: such as age, sex and education;
• geographic: such as urban versus country, type of house and region;
• technical: the use that customers are going to make of a product;
• behavioural: such as spending pattern and frequency of purchase.
Of the various ways to segment markets, we have found that behavioural seg­
mentation, which 'divides buyers into groups based on their knowledge of, at­
titude towards, and use of or response to a product' (Kotler and Keller, 2009)
is a powerful way to bridge marketing and logistics, largely because behaviour
typically impacts on the demand and competitive profiles (described later in this
chapter, Section 2.5.2). For example, Finne and Sivonen (2009) describe a study
of behavioural segments in convenience stores in Europe. Six segments were
identified - main, top-up, impulse, distress, grab-and-go and habitual shoppers.
'Top-up' shoppers may value only bread, milk and convenience foods, whilst an
'impulse' shopper is attracted by special offers and displays.
It is vital that the definition of segments is not a marketing-only task, but that
logistics is involved. The key point is that defining segments that cannot be served
because logistics capability does not exist is unlikely to work. For example, if most
of the spending pattern is around Christmas, then logistics must be capable of
supporting the huge surge in demand at that time.
The important characteristics of segments (McGoldrick, 2002) are that they
must be:
• measurable: variables that can be identified and measured easily;
• economically viable: capable of producing the contribution that justifies the
effort and cost of marketing;
• accessible: geographically or in terms of media communications;
• actionable: can be attracted and served effectively.
The next step is to select target segments and identify how a focal firm is
going to win orders in each. In other words, to define differential advantage that
distinguishes our offerings from those of our competitors. In logistics terms, the

important issues here are the order winning criteria (OWC), and qualifying criteria
(QC) for the target segments. These help in turn to define the marketing mix.
The marketing mix is the set of marketing decisions that is made to implement
positioning strategy (target market segments and differential advantage) and to
achieve the associated marketing and financial goals. The marketing mix has
been popularly termed the '4 Ps' (McCarthy, 1964):
• product: range, sizes, presentation and packaging, design and performance;
• price: list price, discounts, geographical pricing, payment terms;
• promotion: sales force, advertising, consumer promotion, trade promotion,
direct marketing;
• place: channel selection, market coverage, distribution systems, dealer support.
Logistics contributes fundam entally to the 'place' decisions, as well as
supporting 'product' and 'prom otion' decisions and, arguably, enables more
competitive pricing by controlling logistics costs. All too often, 'place' activities
are viewed as the bit bolted to the back of production that gets inventory away




from the factory and into stock-holding points such as warehouses. In order
to achieve the goal of 'the right product in the right place at the right time',
logistics systems and processes need to be designed to support products in the
marketplace.
Segmentation principles can also be applied to industrial marketing. But
'there are distinct differences between the marketing of industrial products and
consumer goods' (Millier and Palmer, 2000: 60), as summarised in Table 2.1.

Let us turn to an industrial marketing example (Case study 2.1) to illustrate
how a new marketing mix can impact on logistics capability and, ultimately, the
fulfilment of different market segments.

CASE STUDY

2.1

Powerdrive Motors
At the time Tom Cross took over as managing director at Powerdrive Motors in South
Africa, the company was an established manufacturer of small electric motors with a strong
reputation for product reliability and technical leadership. On the downside, it was also
regarded in the trade as having high prices and variable delivery. Tom's first task was to
tackle the huge product variety on offer. He saw this as the major problem in addressing
the negative views in the marketplace, and also saw opportunities in streamlining design
and production. The product range was replaced w ith a new generation of designs based
on a few hundred 'modules', which could be assembled in many different combinations
to give variety at low cost. This meant the loss of some customers who had gone to


Powerdrive because they could rely on the company's technical leadership to produce
designs that suited their particular needs. This was not considered important because the
combined sales volume of such customers was under 5 per cent.
Using the new designs, Tom was now able to reorganise the factory into cells
that produced major subassemblies such as rotors and stators. The work flow was
transformed, and manufacturing throughput time was reduced from six weeks to just
four days. Cost improvements meant that average price reductions of between 10 and
15 per cent could be offered.
Powerdrive's customer service policy was redrafted to offer quotations w ithin a
maximum of one hour of any enquiry, and for deliveries of finished product to be made
within one week 'anywhere in northern Europe'. This new policy was explained to internal
sales staff, and to sales representatives and agents employed by the organisation. If 'old'
customers wanted special designs that were no longer in the range, the sales staff were
instructed to explain Powerdrive's new policy and politely decline the order.
At first, business soared. Impressed by the lower prices and short delivery times,
customers flocked to Powerdrive and sales jumped by 50 per cent. But then things began
to go sour. First, the factory could no longer cope with the demands being placed on
it. The addition of a large order for lawnmower motors blocked out a lot of production
capacity from January to June. Order lead times during this period in particular slid back
to former levels. Second, a Brazilian supplier spotted the opportunity to enter the market
w ith prices that undercut Powerdrive by 20 per cent. Whilst only half of the product
range was covered by this new entrant, it was the high volume products that were
especially threatened. Further, the new competitor offered three-day lead times from
stock that had been established in the country. Third, some of the former customers,
who could no longer obtain their bespoke designs from Powerdrive, were complaining
within the industry that Powerdrive's technical leadership had been sacrificed. Although
small in number, such customers were influential at trade fairs and conferences.
Questions

1 Characterise the changes in the market segments using the concept of order winners
and qualifiers.
2 Evaluate the changes that took place in the marketing mix and how this impacted on the
fulfilment of different market segments' needs (in terms of OWC and QC) by logistics.

Segmentation often is undertaken by adopting the easy way to group customers by account size. Whilst this is easily measurable, it fails on the fourth of McGoldrick's
criteria listed above: it is not actionable in supply chain terms. Indeed, when we
review conventional approaches to market segmentation and their implications
for marketing and supply chain strategy (as summarised in Table 2.2), it can be
seen that there are limited implications for supply chain strategy.
• P ro d u c t a n d service se g m e n ta tio n : this involves dividing customers into
groups, depending on the products or services they buy. From a marketing
perspective, this does not provide any information about the customer in
terms of their motivations for buying the products, or the benefits they seek.

Therefore this m ethod of segmentation cannot be used to drive marketing
activities. From the supply chain strategy perspective, different products can
often be distinguished by their demand characteristics and service require­
ments, which drive supply chain strategy (as described in Section 2.5.2). How­
ever, this is not always the case, and different customers buying the same
product may exhibit different buying behaviours depending on other factors
(as discussed in Section 2.5.3).
• D em ograph ic seg m en ta tio n : a market can be segmented on the basis of
demographics - such as age and lifestyle for consumers and sector and turn­
over for industrial customers. From a marketing perspective, this provides im­
portant profiling information, which can be used for promotional and pricing
activities. Demographics have no implications for supply chain strategy except
when products can be linked to specific demographic segments.
• Geography, this requires segmenting customers on the basis of their geographi­
cal location, for instance rural versus urban. As with demographics, this can
provide marketing with im portant profiling information. From a supply chain
perspective, geographical location can be used to differentiate distribution
strategy.
• C hannel: routes to market are becoming more sophisticated and complex
and are an increasingly important com ponent of m any winning value propo­
sitions. For instance, in the past, pet foods tended to be cheap, low quality
and sold exclusively through supermarkets. But now premium pet foods are
sold through veterinarians, breeders and pet stores. Like geographical location,
channels help profile customers for marketing activities, and can be used to
differentiate distribution strategy.
In practice, market segmentation typically is implem ented by the marketing
function in order to determine segment-specific marketing mix and value
propositions. Thus, segmentation tends to be actionable by m arketing and
drives marketing strategies and processes, but does not drive supply chain
strategies and processes. An example from our research in the fast-moving
consumer goods (FMCG) sector (in Case Study 2.2) illustrates the problems of
poor alignm ent between market segmentation and supply chain strategy and
processes.


CASE STUDY

2.2

Segmentation at CleanCo
CleanCo is a manufacturer of cleaning products that serves the European grocery
retailing market. CleanCo currently segments its customers on the value of customer
accounts. The primary division is between n a tio n a l accounts, for which 10 accounts
constitute 70 per cent of sales by value, and field sales, which comprise a long 'tail' of
more than 200 accounts that together make up only 30 per cent of sales. Due to the size
of the field sales structure, a secondary classification groups accounts by channel type:
neighbourhood retail, discount and pharmacy as summarised in Table 2.3.

Whilst CleanCo currently segments its retail customers by account size, its sales
organisation has identified two significant types of buying behaviour displayed by the
customer base, shown in Table 2.4:
•
•

volume-driven buying behaviour;
m argin-driven buying behaviour.

Volume-driven customers are keen to capitalise on both product and supply chain cost
savings in order to pass them on to their customers to drive volume sales. There are two
variants of the volume-driven behaviour:
•
•

everyday low price (EDLP);
discount.

Retailers pursuing an EDLP strategy strive for continuous price reduction from suppliers
such as CleanCo to drive a fairly consistent, high volume of sales. This should result in a
relatively stable pattern of demand in the washing and bathing sector. Discounters, on

the other hand, are looking for bargains so they can 'stack 'em high and sell 'em cheap',
a strategy more likely to result in a volatile demand pattern. Margin-driven customers are
keen to add value for their customers by offering a wide selection of products and valueadding services. This strategy also results in a relatively stable demand pattern in this sector.
However, a complicating factor when trying to deconstruct the buying behaviour
of CleanCo's retailer customers is that several secondary factors are used to support
products in the marketplace. Such factors include product types (e.g. premium, mid,
utilitarian), product range (e.g. current products, end of lines, 'b ' grade), merchandising
requirements (e.g. category captains) and promotions strategy (e.g. roll-back, 12-week,
4-week, Hi-Lo). Promotions are by far the most disruptive of these factors and occur
in all three types of retailer behavioural segments. Although the promotions generally
are planned well in advance w ith the retailers, they cause significant disruption to the
supply chain operations due to the peaks and troughs in demand that they create.
Furthermore, the deeper the promotional activity, the greater the volatility created and
the greater the disruption to the supply chain. This has the effect of masking what is
fundamentally a fairly stable demand pattern w ith somewhat artificial volatile demand.
Consequently, neither the current sales account segmentation nor the potential
behavioural segmentation can be used to determine different supply chain strategies for
each segment. Instead, each operation within the supply chain makes decisions based
on the functional criteria that affect its part of the supply chain - decisions which bear no
relation to either of the two retailer segmentation approaches. Thus, there is a misalignment
between marketing segmentation and supply chain strategy, as illustrated in Table 2.5.

Questions

1 How could CleanCo deal with promotions when using the behavioural segmentation
approach?
2 Could this be used to drive different supply chain strategies and why?


The question arises - what approach to market segmentation can be used to de­
termine supply chain strategy? It is widely acknowledged by scholars developing
multiple supply chain strategies, as discussed in Section 2.5, that the demand pro­
file is a key determ inant of the appropriate strategy, so let's start by understanding
how demand is forecast.

2.3 Demand profiling
Marketing people want to forecast demand in order to plan broad goals such as
allocating the salesforce, setting sales goals, promotions planning and advertising
campaigns. But logistics people need to know how m any to deliver, where and
when to do so, for each SKU in the product range and for each channel - not just
for the range as a whole. This leads to a common perception of the two functions marketing dealing in the abstract and logistics dealing in the day-to-day realities.
The two business functions must be careful not to talk past each other, for both
have im portant insights into what the end-customer wants. For many firms, of
course, this is not an issue, and the two functions collaborate extensively. The
aim is to combine forces and produce the most accurate profile of future demand.
It is impossible to predict the future with certainty, so it is necessary to forecast
what will happen. Accurate forecasts of demand are one of the key starting points
for achieving competitive supply chains, reflected in such measures as high onshelf availability (the percentage of a trading day for which a given SKU is avail­
able 'on the shelf' to be purchased by an end-customer) and low inventories. The
key approaches to forecasting demand are explained at length in such texts as
Wild (2002) and Waters (2003). Here, we will stick to some of the broad principles
that apply to demand forecasting: first when there are limited or no historical
data available, and second when such data are available.
First, consider the dem and profiles in Figure 2.2 when forecasting dem and for
a new product during the early stages of its lifecycle (introduction and growth).
A forecast that over-estimates the way that demand takes off results in too much
inventory too early in the product lifecycle. If this situation is allowed to contin­
ue, it will result in the need to get rid of the surplus unsold stock by mark-downs
or by disposal. On the other hand, a forecast that under-estimates actual demand
results in insufficient stock to meet what the end-customer wants. If allowed to
continue, this results in lost sales opportunities and hence loss of market share to
competitors who can better meet demand. Both scenarios are familiar challenges
for grocery (such as managing promotions) and planning fashion goods for a new
season when there is no directly usable history of demand, and forecasting relies
on judgemental methods such as historical analogy, perhaps augmented by market
research. Demand forecasting of new drugs (called 'new pharmaceutical entities' NPEs) are especially problematic because of the uncertainties of approval from the
Food and Drug Administration (FDA) - which takes five years on average - and the
take-up by physicians after launch. Lifecycle curves and growth functions can be
used to model demand by incorporating 'market based evidence, uncertainty and
judgements about what might happen during the drug's lifetime' (Latta, 2007).





Figure 2.2

The impact of uncertainty

W hen historical demand data such as point of sale (POS) are available, various
modelling techniques can be used to produce projective forecasts. Consider the de­
m and profile in Figure 2.3a, which shows actual demand for years 1-3, and forecast
demand for years 1-4. It is based on the profile of sales of a product called 'barbecue
sauce', which is produced in many flavours and is sold mainly in the summer.

Figure 2.3a

Modelling trend and seasonality


Differences between actual A and forecast demand F (Case study 1.3 uses sched­
uled demand, S) for each period n of years 1-3 are termed the error, E:
En = An - Fn

If data are collected over a number of periods n (here, n = 36), then the mean
absolute deviation (MAD) is a widely used measure of forecast error:

In practice, the MAD may be weighted exponentially to give higher weightings
to the most recent demand data (Wild, 2002: 176). It is important to note that
forecast error is a result of the forecasting approach used, as well as the nature of the
actual demand. Indeed, in Case study 2.5 Kimberly-Clark uses different forecasting
approaches, depending upon the nature of the demand, as described in Section 2.6.
Figure 2.3b shows how the total (aggregate) demand for this product can be
broken down into four components:
• Base: the level demand that needs to be adjusted for trend and seasonality.
• Trend: the long-term trend, which in this case shows a healthy increase yearon-year from base.
• Seasonality: the periodic increase and reduction in demand as a result of
consumer behaviour - in this case between summer and winter. This can be
measured by means of a seasonal index - which is the seasonal value divided by
the trend, calculated for each period.
• Uncertainty: sometimes called 'randomness', this is the balance of demand due
to effects we cannot predict with accuracy. These effects may include short­
term weather variations, which mean that the consumer is put off barbecuing
because it is too cold, wet or windy. Other demand 'spikes' may be due to
special causes like the promotion of a particular flavour of sauce by a chef in a
popular television programme.
Base and trend demands can be found by linear regression analysis, and a
seasonality index can be found by dividing the original data by the trend for each
period. Uncertainty usually is allowed for by increasing the forecast to provide a
safety margin to make it unlikely that there are missed sales opportunities (see
Figure 2.2). Forecast dem and for a future period n is th en calculated from:
Fn = (base + trendn) x seasonality in d ex n + uncertainty n

So forecast demand for year 4 was based on projecting historical data for these
four components into the future.
So far, the forecast has been carried out at the aggregate level, 'barbecue sauce'.
And this is what forecasting professionals often encourage you to do - forecast ac­
curacy is best at aggregate level and worst at SKU level. But there are many flavours
in the range - such as sweet hickory, Cajun and peri-peri. And there are different
pack sizes and territories that are supplied. So the aggregate plan has to be disaggre­
gated into individual SKUs. Often, this is achieved by calculating the percentage of
the total demand for each SKU from historical data, and then applying a seasonality
index to refine the forecast for each period (see, for example, Ogrodowczyk, 2008).
We return to the issue of disaggregation in Section 2.5, when we address demand





Figure 2.3b Modelling trend and seasonality - continued

profiling for segmented supply chain strategy, and disaggregation is also covered
in Section 6.1.1 from the point of view of planning and control in manufacturing.
Forecasting is a major factor in logistics today, and we have touched on only
some of the key issues in this section. We address further issues in other sections
of this book as follows:
• Because of uncertainty, it is better to rely less on forecasting by shrinking lead
times and engaging more closely with actual demand (Section 5.1.4).
• Several m anagement approaches can be used to improve forecast accuracy
(Section 6.2.2).
• Forecasting should be recognised as a key business process (Section 7.2.1).
• Poor internal coordination compounds forecasting problems (Section 6.1.4).
• External coordination with partners in a supply chain can be used to develop
better forecasts through collaborative planning, forecasting and replenishment
(CPFR, Section 6.3.2).


Activity 2.2
Explain how marketing and logistics functions should work together to create more accurate
forecasts of demand.

2.4 Quality of service
Key issues: How do customer expectations affect logistics service? How does

satisfaction stack up with customer loyalty?

Most supply chains that involve physical products end with service processes
such as retailing (grocery or apparel), healthcare (pharmaceutical and other
medical goods) and distribution (motor cars). Service processes mean that the
customer is present in some way, although distribution through web-based shop­
ping, telephone and mail order mean that customers do not have to be present
physically. Performance of service processes often differs between employees, be­
tween customers and from one hour to the next. If you want good service from
the local supermarket, do not go on Saturdays or near to Christmas when the
service is under severe capacity pressure: on-shelf availability is at its lowest, and
queues at the checkout are at their longest. The key point is that 'service is the
combination of outcomes and experiences delivered to and received by the cus­
tomer' (Johnston and Clark, 2008).
Quality of service takes place during service delivery, which is the interaction
between the customer (business or consumer) and the service process. 'Gaps' can
emerge between what the service is supposed to be, what the customer expects
it to be, and how the customer perceives it when it is delivered (Zeithaml et al.,
1988; Parasuraman et al., 1991). We can illustrate these gaps as a simplified gap
model (Figure 2.4):
• Gap 1 refers to differences between customer expectations and how these have
been developed into a service specification by the supplier.

Figure 2.4

Simplified service quality gap model

(Source: After Parasuraman, et al., 1991)




• Gap 2 refers to differences between how the specification was drawn up and
how it was delivered.
• Gap 3 refers to differences between what the customer expected and what he or
she perceived was delivered.
• Gap 4 refers to differences between how supplier and customer perceived the
service delivery.
Gaps in quality of service can arise, as seen in Case study 2.3 on IKEA.

2.3

Tears at teatime at IKEA
Next week, Jane Fillimore will move into a new flat. You can tell something about the
28-year-old music-industry publicist from Kilburn, north-west London, from the list of
furniture she is buying. There is the Pax Brivic wardrobe, the Norden dining table and
the Bonde media storage combination. Fillimore wants style - but on a budget. She is
part of Generation IKEA.
Not that she wants to be. She hates the Swedish retailer, and only last Sunday had
her worst shopping day ever at the firm's superstore in a drab retail park near the new
Wembley stadium in London.
She wanted to pick up the Pax Brivic wardrobe she had ordered the week before. Easy,
you m ight think, but just getting served was an ordeal. When she entered the store, an
assistant told her to 'walk the mile of hell' past wannabe-stylish urban living rooms to
the giant storage zone.
The store did not have her wardrobe and a salesman sent her back through road
works to IKEA's nearby distribution centre. The distribution centre had the wardrobe,
but could not give it to her w ithout a receipt. To get one, she had to go back to the
main store. But the main store had lost her order, so she had to go to customer service.
This department is not called customer service at IKEA, it's called customer returns, and
it took her half an hour to find.
By 4.30 pm, Fillimore was right back where she started. Exasperated, she put her
head in her hands and burst into tears. 'I don't even like the wardrobe', she sobbed. 'I
bought it because it's cheap. That's the only reason I come here.' By 5.00 pm, the store
is closing, and she can only dream of getting her wardrobe by Friday. She could walk
back through the little sets that represent the nation's living rooms to try one last time
to find her wardrobe, but she can't face it. As she walks out, I ask her if she knows that
Argos and Sainsbury's (two other UK retailers) are selling furniture. For the first time all
day, she breaks into a smile.
'Really?' she grins. 'I'll go there tomorrow. I never want to come back to this place again.'
(Source: Based on an article by John Arlidge, Sunday Times, 26 October 2003)

Question

1 When IKEA was founded 60 years ago by Ingmar Kamprad, he realised that custom­
ers did not mind queuing, collecting their purchases and assembling the furniture
themselves as long as the price was right. Suggest why gaps in quality of service have
opened up.


2.4.1

Customer loyalty
Whilst plugging gaps in service quality helps to improve customer satisfaction,
this is a 'qualifier' for long-term customer loyalty. The two concepts are not the
same. Piercy (2009) distinguishes them as follows:
• Customer satisfaction is what people think of us - quality of service, value
for money. It is an attitude (how does a customer feel about our product/
service?).
• Customer loyalty is how long we keep a customer (or what share of his or her
business we take). It is a behaviour (does he or she buy from us more than once?).
Nevertheless, the attitude of customer satisfaction is key to the behaviour of
customer loyalty. Parasuraman and Grewal (2000) link the two concepts by pro­
posing the 'key drivers of customer loyalty', shown in Figure 2.5. Also, note the
connection to Tesco's core purpose (on page 6). There is a purpose to this beyond
the words: Tesco seeks actively to extend its relationships with customers by of­
fering a broad range of services such as optician, pharmacy, non-food, and bank
and insurance products. All purchases in these diverse categories and its core gro­
cery business are rewarded by the firm's loyalty programme, which provides Tesco
with further detailed insights into the behaviour of its customers. This data can
be used for sophisticated segmentation that allows all customers to be 'scored' in
one or more segments to allow accurate measurement and targeting (Finne and
Sivonen, 2009).
The benefits of customer loyalty are potentially huge. The loyal customer
should be viewed in terms of lifetime spending potential. Thus, a customer of
VW Audi Group could be viewed as worth €300k rather than the €30k of today's
sales transaction. As Johnston and Clark (2005) put it, loyal customers:
• generate long-term revenue streams (high lifetime values);
• tend to buy more than new customers;
• tend to increase spending over time;
• may be willing to pay premium prices;
• provide cost savings compared with attracting new customers.
The logistics challenge is to support the development of customer loyalty by
designing and delivering quality of service. Of the three drivers of customer
loyalty shown in Figure 2.5, quality of service is 'essential for excellent market
performance on an enduring basis' (Berry, 1999: 8-9). The rationale for this is that
'service quality is much more difficult for competitors to copy than are product
quality and price'. Supporting product availability and delivery reliability through
such means as channel selection, market coverage, distribution systems and
dealer support all help to nourish customer loyalty. So does logistics support of
product characteristics (such as customisation or product range) and of marketing
initiatives (such as promotions).
Case study 2.4 shows how customer loyalty can be improved through the
improvement of service quality and its integration with the product.

Batman - adding value through quality of service
Everglo Battery, the premier battery manufacturer and service provider in South Africa,
looked back on the development of its marketing strategy in four stages. Each had been
signalled by advancing the concepts of what is meant by 'quality of service'. Stage 1 had
been the basic product: a sealed lead-acid battery for use in mining applications. Batter­
ies were regarded by customers as a mature product and as a 'grudge buy'. Each year,
the basic product was under heavy downward price pressure. Stage 2 had been the
industry reaction to customer service: the addition of warranty replacement of defec­
tive products, of quality assurance (QA) audits of a supplier's design and manufacturing
processes, and of parts and service provision.
Stage 3 had recognised the need to go much further in terms of customer service. A
whole raft of additional services had been conceived with a view to adding value. Break­
downs were fixed at short notice by means of field service engineers. Everglo products
could now be delivered and installed at customer premises. Price lists were simplified by
including peripheral equipment, such as contactors, that had to be added to a battery
rack in order to make it work. Advice and tips were added to help customers warm to
Everglo products. In a proactive move, Everglo introduced charts and advice about the
application of battery products in general, and the resulting tables became an indus­
try standard. Parts and service in the field were upgraded to a '24-hour, no-nonsense
back-up service'. And customer training built on Everglo's position as an industry leader.
Rather than sales seminars, Everglo's held customer training seminars, where the com­
pany spoke on behalf of the industry rather than as a supplier.
In spite of having reached a pre-eminent position in mining power supply, Everglo
recognised that the centre of Figure 2.6 was, in effect, a 'black hole'. Each year,
competitors added more services to their basic products, too. In effect, the second and,
to some extent, the third circles were being absorbed into the 'com m odity' category,
and customer expectations increased all the time. A new stage 4 strategy was conceived
to take Everglo into a position that competitors would find even more difficult to
follow. The new strategy was coined 'Batman': battery management for life. The aim
was nothing less than a total, customer-orientated product management service that
provides 'power for life'. The supplier takes over the task of managing the customer's

assets, including problem identification, training and managing cash flow. The objective

of 'Batman' is to look at the product the way the customer does, performing best at
what the customer values most rather than at what the supplier values most.
Questions

1 Has Everglo reached the end of the line in terms of its quality of service strategy?
2 As a competitor to Everglo, what would be your options in response to Everglo's latest
moves?

2.4.2 Value disciplines
Figure 2.5 refers to 'perceived value'. A development of the service qualityproduct quality-price model is that of value disciplines. Instead of competing on
all of these fronts equally, Treacy and Wiersema (1997) argue that companies
taking leadership positions do so by narrowing their competitive focus, not by




broadening it. They propose three strategies, or 'generic value disciplines' that
can be followed:
• Operational excellence. Here, the strategy centres on superb operations and
execution, often by providing a reasonable quality at low price. The focus is on
efficiency, streamlining operations, supply chain management and everyday
low price. Most large international corporations use this discipline.
• Product leadership. Here, the leaders are very strong in innovation and brand
marketing and operate in dynamic markets. The focus is on development,
innovation, design, time-to-market and high margins in a short time frame.
'It was the ability of Apple to innovate in m any spaces - getting the music
companies to agree to 99 cent pricing, creating wonderful iTunes software,
making a terrific physical product, the iPod, that just works in your hand - that
gave Steve Jobs his success. It was building an ecosystem of innovation, not just
the iPod, that did it' (www.businessweek.com/innovate/NussbaumOnDesign/).
• Customer intimacy. Here, leaders excel in customer attention and customer
service. They tailor their products and services towards individual or almost
individual customers. The focus is on customer relationship m anagement
(see next section): they deliver products and services on time and above cus­
tomer expectations. They also look to lifetime value concepts, reliability and
being close to the customer.
Whilst most organisations are under pressure to reduce prices, speed up delivery
and improve customer service, the best will have a clear focus as a key part of their
competitive strategy (page 29). This focus needs to be improved and adapted
over time.

egies (Section 1.4.3).

2.4.3 Relationship marketing and customer relationship
management (CRM)
A development of customer intimacy is relationship marketing. Here, the aim
is to develop long-term, loyal customers through 'bonding' with them . This
development can take place at three levels (de Chernatony and McDonald, 2003):
• Financial incentives: such as frequent flyer schemes and reward cards.
• Social and financial bonds: from a dentist making personal notes about clients
that can be used on subsequent visits to accountants taking their clients to
rugby matches.


• Structural bonds: such as IT systems that bind client and customer together,
sometimes called 'electronic handcuffs'.
This development process becomes a strategic task. The principle behind
customer relationship management (CRM) is that marketing strategies are
extended continuously in order to strengthen customer loyalty. Eventually,
customer and supplier are so closely intertwined that it would be difficult
to sever the relationship. In other words, the exit barriers become higher and
higher. CRM 'provides enhanced opportunities to use data and information to
both understand customers and co-create value with them. This requires a cross­
functional integration of processes, people, logistics and marketing capabilities
that is enabled through information, technology and applications' (Payne and
Frow, 2005). Figure 2.7 compares CRM thinking with traditional relationships
that are limited to buying and selling functions of the organisations concerned
(Payne et al., 1995). We explore further the issue of partnerships in the supply
chain in Chapter 8. Case study 2.4, Batman, illustrates the evolution of diamondtype relationships in an industrial setting.

2.5 Segmented supply chain strategy
Key issue: How can we develop multiple supply chain strategies that simultane­
ously improve efficiencies and service levels?

In a highly competitive global market, businesses face the apparently conflicting
challenges of driving growth through innovation by 'product leadership',
whilst simultaneously reducing costs via 'operational excellence' (Treacy and
Wiersema, 1997). This business challenge has a direct impact on the supply
chain. Further to Section 1.4.3 on differentiating strategies, Shewchuk (1998)
suggested 'one size does not fit all', in other words it is unlikely that markets
can be represented by one segment and fulfilled by one supply chain strategy.
Whilst this has been long recognised, businesses have been slow to segment
supply chain strategy, which implies the developm ent of multiple supply chain
strategies aligned with the needs of different market segments. This concept
is now gaining support and has been a feature of the Gartner AMR Research
Supply Chain Executive conferences in 2010 and 2011. It is a hot topic for
consultants too, evidenced by a recent article in McKinsey Quarterly (2011).
McKinsey favours the term 'splintering' to segmentation but the sentim ent is
the same.
The idea of segmented supply chain strategy emerged with Fisher's seminal
Harvard Business Review (HBR) article in 1997, when he proposed that different
supply chain strategies are required for different product types. He proposed that
there is a match between efficient supply chains and functional products and
responsive supply chains and innovative products. Other supply chain-product
combinations are deemed a mismatch, as shown in Figure 2.8.
Whilst Fisher's article represented the emergence of the idea of differentiated
and multiple supply chain strategies, it had a num ber of shortcomings:

Figure 2.8

Matching supply chains with products

(Source: Fisher, 1997)


• It is highly simplistic, suggesting that all products can be categorised into either
functional or innovative and that this could be used to determine which of two
supply chain strategies should be adopted.
• It ignores the reality that the demand profile for a product depends on many
factors, other than the product type, including marketing promotions and
the context in which the product is purchased, e.g. bathing products may be
bought occasionally as presents or routinely.
• Few products now fit the ideal of a functional product, satisfying a basic need
with little change over time and subject to stable demand.
• Finally, the whole approach is orientated around products rather than customers,
whose buying behaviour may be quite different for the same product.
Following Fisher's product-matched supply chain strategies, a series of papers
were published by scholars examining the combination of lean and agile
strategies (see, for example, Naylor et al., 1999, Christopher and Towill, 2001,
and Childerhouse, et al., 2002, as discussed in detail in Chapter 7). The use of
the demand profile - such as volume, variety, variability and uncertainty - as a
determinant of the appropriate supply chain strategy was a common thread in
this research.
In parallel to the development of the lean, agile approaches, the 'strategic
alignment' approach sought to establish a formal link between marketing and
supply chain strategy. As its name suggests, it took a more strategic approach.
Gattorna and Walters (1996) introduced a four-stage framework for strategic
alignment, proposing that strategy is developed in response to the competitive
environment, supported by the right culture and leadership style. Although
this was customer-, rather than product-, orientated it was highly prescriptive,
depending on customers fitting one of four pre-defined types.
We present in Section 2.5.4 a simplified four-step approach to developing
segmented supply chain strategy. However, first it is im portant to understand the
following, as covered in the next three subsections:
• supply chain and marketing alignment;
• the supply chain strategy drivers;
• how to select drivers for segmentation.

2.5.1

Supply chain and marketing alignment
In Section 1.4.2 we addressed the issue of alignment of logistics processes within
the supply chain, whereas here we consider alignment of supply chain strategy with
marketing strategy. The ultimate goal of a publicly listed company is to deliver a
sustainable return to its shareholders. It does so through its business strategy, which
is typically a mix of sales growth and cost reduction targets. The traditional cascade
of strategy typically assigns the sales growth targets to the domain of marketing,
and cost reduction targets to the supply chain (Smith, 1956). Such approaches tend
to lead to the pursuit of marketing and supply chain targets in isolation and the




long-term erosion of shareholder value (Christopher and Ryals, 1999). Further, this
typically leads to tension, as shown in Figure 2.9.

Figure 2.9

Tension between supply chain and marketing objectives

On the one hand, marketing is about creating demand and its objectives tend
to be around maximising revenue through changes to the marketing mix, for
example, introducing new product variants, selling through new distribution
channels and running promotions to boost demand. On the other hand,
supply chain is about fulfilling demand and its objectives are often around
cost minimisation, for example improving efficiencies and quality, reducing
inventories and increasing the num ber of turns, standardising products where
possible, rationalising suppliers. Many of these objectives can be conflicting, for
instance if marketing proliferate the num ber of products or variants, this both
increases the num ber of SKUs, and the demand variability to which they're
subjected, increasing the safety stock, and thus inventory, required. Further,
promotions employed by marketing dramatically increase demand variability
and uncertainty, again requiring increases in safety stock, if product availability
is to be maintained.
Whilst there will always be a natural tension between marketing and supply
chain, it is vital to business competitiveness that conflicting objectives are
resolved, leading to congruence between supply chain strategy (spanning plan,
source, make and deliver processes) and marketing strategy (encapsulating the
marketing mix in terms of product, place, promotion and price). There are a
num ber of approaches to this, which are complementary to each other:
• Promote integrative behaviours between marketing and supply chain, as de­
scribed in Section 8.1.1 on internal integration. Employ enablers of customer
alignment as identified in our systematic review of the disparate and m ulti­
disciplinary literature (Wong et al., 2012): process orientated organisational
structure, internal relational behaviour, customer relational behaviour, top
m anagem ent support, information sharing and business performance mea­
surement system (illustrated in Table 2.6).
• Employ a sales and operations planning (S&OP) process, as described in Section
7.2.1, which has been shown to improve alignment and integration across all
functions involved.
• Develop and implement segmented supply chain strategy.

To develop segmented supply chain strategy it is necessary that supply chain
strategy is developed to meet different market needs. But what are the market
needs that drive supply chain strategy and can be used to segment the market? As
discussed earlier in this chapter, approaches to segmentation used by marketing
are not actionable by the supply chain (see Section 2.2).

2.5.2 The supply chain strategy drivers
From a synthesis of the previous work on lean and agile supply chains and
research at Cranfield University, three profiles have been identified which drive
supply chain strategy and can be used to segment the market, as illustrated in
Figure 2.10.
Whilst there are three types of profiles that can be used to determine segmented
supply chain strategy, it should be stressed that they represent a suite of profiles
and measures which may be used, rather than a fixed set that are mandatory.
Moreover, the use of the demand profile has been found to be the most powerful
approach to segmentation (as illustrated by the four-step segmentation approach
described in Section 2.5.4). This is due largely to the high costs associated with
fulfilling unpredictable and variable demand, either in reduced customer service
(as orders are not fulfilled) or through increased supply chain costs, such as
inventory (as discussed under demand profiling in Section 2.3). The reality is that
for many products consumer demand is actually stable. Research into consumer
packaged goods companies has identified that typically 60-70 per cent demand is
actually stable (Godsell, 2012). The key to success for the supply chain is to find





Figure 2.10

Strategy drivers and their implications for supply chain strategy

the stable, or base, demand. If you can identify and isolate the stable demand,
you can m aintain or increase customer service whilst removing the costly buffers
(inventory, spare capacity, work in progress, etc.) against uncertainty. You create
a stable supply chain process that may account for 70 per cent of demand, but
requires less than 30 per cent of management effort. It creates the management
headroom to focus on the truly variable or unpredictable products: the
promotions, brand extensions and new product introductions critical to driving
growth through innovation.
First, however, let us understand the three profiles and their im plications
for supply chain strategy: dem and profile, competitive profile and product
profile.
• D em and profile. Demand profiling (discussed in Section 2.3) requires an u n ­
derstanding of base, trend, seasonality and uncertainty of dem and, prom ot­
ing an understanding of the causes of variable dem and. Further, what's im ­
portant for segmented supply chain strategy is to separate out base dem and
from the variable and uncertain dem and. Consistent w ith this, the dem and
profile is characterised by dem and volume and variability measured at SKU
level:
• D em and volume is the num ber of units of a SKU ordered as used by a num ber
of authors (Childerhouse et al., 2002; Christopher and Towill, 2001) to drive
segmented supply chain strategy.
• D em and variability is the change in dem and over a sequence of time buck­
ets for a particular SKU (Bhattacharya and Jina, 1995) and is indicated
by the coefficient of variation (CV) - the ratio of standard deviation
to the average over a given time period. It has been used by a num ber
of authors (Naylor et al., 1999; Childerhouse et al., 2002; Christopher


and Towill, 2002) to determine segmented supply chain strategy. Quite
often, if dem and variability is high, so is dem and uncertainty, indicated by
forecast error. However, as we have seen in Section 2.3, some com ponents
of dem and variability, such as that due to trends or seasonality, can be
predicted or forecast (at least in part) and therefore are not classed as
uncertain demand.
Demand profile has implications for supply chain strategy, as shown in
Figure 2.10. For example, high levels of demand variability and uncertainty
imply the need for larger buffers to enable the supply chain to respond whilst
still providing high levels of service. Buffers can be in the form of excess capac­
ity in manufacturing or transport, inventory levels and extended quoted lead
times. Also, the level of demand variability has important implications for the
control of material flow covered in Chapter 6. A just-in-time (JIT) pull system
using kanban operates effectively only when demand is relatively stable. Con­
versely, material requirement planning (MRP) systems can cope with highly
variable demand.
• Competitive profile. This is based on the competitive factors we introduced
in Section 1.3 - hard objectives (time, cost and quality). For example, Ford
chooses to compete on low price and delivery speed (by making to stock),
whilst BMW chooses to compete by making more expensive and highly
specified cars to customer order while the customer waits. Time refers to the
order lead time or some element of response time. Cost refers to the total cost
of supply and underpins the price charged. Quality implies both the quality of
the product, such as the acceptable defect level, and the quality of the service
(see Section 2.4), which may be indicated by delivery reliability.
The competitive profile also has implications for supply chain strategy.
The order lead time limits the extent to which the supply chain can be
order-driven. If a very short order lead tim e is required, it may be neces­
sary to make-to-stock (MTS) and provide local warehousing or vendor m an ­
aged inventory. In some cases, however it is not possible to MTS because
the product is customised or provided in such high variety that finished
stocks are not economically viable. In this case the product is made-to-order (MTO) and the m anufacturing process may require buffers in terms of
excess m anufacturing capacity and raw material stocks to support a short
order lead time.
• Product profile. The level of product standardisation, or conversely the level
of customisation where the product specification is specific to a certain
customer, is the product profile dimension. It is an im portant determ inant
as all customised operations must be order driven and therefore may extend
lead times, or alternatively require excess capacity, to be responsive. The
customisation level requires analysis at SKU level in terms of the proportion
of internal manufacturing activities, and sourced components, that are
customised. This analysis can result in the categorisation of SKUs on the
basis of customisation levels, high, medium and low. For high levels of
customisation, particularly where the customisation occurs early in the
m anufacturing process and therefore necessitates a long lead time, there may
be the potential to reduce customisation levels in two ways. First, the relevance




to customers may be questioned - is this aspect of customisation providing
value to the customer? Second, the possibility of different options being built
in as standard could be explored, resulting in a certain level of redundancy,
but allowing greater standardisation of the manufacturing process and a
shorter lead time.
Now the three profiles of supply chain strategy drivers are understood, how
may they be used for market segmentation and the development of segmented
supply chain strategy?

2.5.3 Selecting drivers for segmentation
In practice it is not possible, nor desirable, to segment the market using the full
suite of profiles and drivers of supply chain strategy. Instead, the selection should
be viewed as being specific to the context - company and market served. Appro­
priate drivers can be selected in various ways and here we propose two selection
criteria:
• the extent to which the drivers vary across the SKUs - select those that vary
the most;
• the value delivered by the focal firm, from the customer's perspective, compared
to that delivered by competitors - customer value gap analysis.

Driver selection using variation o f drivers

One approach to examining the extent to which drivers vary across customers
is to develop supply chain strategy profiles, as shown in Figure 2.11, for two
contrasting customers (A and B) of Autoco (an automotive seat manufacturer).
The profiles show that both customers want 100 per cent on time in full delivery

Figure 2.11

Supply chain strategy driver profiles for two customers of Autoco

performance and the same high level of product quality. However, they differ
in that customer A demands relatively high volume on a shorter lead time with
a higher delivery frequency and customer B exhibits relatively unpredictable
demand and the products are generally more customised (i.e. a greater proportion
of the product is unique to that customer). This indicates possible drivers for
segmenting customers.
Selecting the most appropriate drivers to segment the market, and thus drive
segmented supply chain strategy, is particularly challenging because they vary
with many factors, not just customers. Equally, the demand profile varies across
a given product range with typically a small proportion of the SKUs accounting
for a large proportion of the demand. Moreover, the drivers vary with other
important factors:
• Marketing activity. Promotions introduce artificial fluctuations in demand with
an initial peak in demand followed by a series of peaks and troughs, increasing
demand variability and, typically, uncertainty as well. Related to promotion
can be the introduction of new variants or products, which affect demand for
other variants.
• Context o f purchase. The context of purchase tends to affect competitive profile.
For example, a direct current motor can be bought as a breakdown replace­
ment, where the order winner (OW) is short lead time, or as part of a planned
installation where the OW is price.
• Product life cycle stage. The competitive and demand profiles vary with the
stage in the product life cycle, as neatly illustrated by Childerhouse et al.
(2002) in Figure 2.12, showing the OW and supply chain strategies used by a

Figure 2.12

Demand and competitive profile vary with product life cycle stage

commercial lighting manufacturer at each stage in the life cycle. During the
uncertain introductory phase, design capability was the OW but, as volumes
increased in the growth stage, service level in terms of availability became the
key priority. Through maturity and saturation phases, as volumes peak, price
becomes the OW, whilst during the decline stage, availability is once again
the key competitive priority.
Driver selection using customer value g ap analysis

Customer value is the customer-perceived benefit gained from a product/service
compared with the cost of purchase. In order to measure customer value, we need
to understand what aspects of a product or service a customer values (Johnson
and Scholes, 2005). Here, we are interested primarily in aspects of customer value
that impact on logistics strategy - in other words the three profiles described
earlier:
• demand profile: the characteristics of demand in terms of volume and variability;
• competitive profile: how the focal firm chooses to compete in the marketplace,
w ith regards to cost, time and quality;
• product profile: the extent to which the product is customised to specific
customer requirements.
Customer value is assessed by means of an administered questionnaire to
measure customer views of the three profiles (specifically drivers that are relevant
to the focal firm) in terms of:
• relative importance (by apportioning 100 points across the drivers);
• performance of the focal firm and a key competitor identified by the customer
(measured on a 0-5 Likert scale).
The charts in Figure 2.13 show the value (relative importance multiplied by
performance) plotted across the drivers for both Autoco and its key competitor
for two stages in the product life cycle - product launch and steady state. This
reveals the customer value gaps, as perceived by the customer, between the value
Autoco delivers and that of its key competitor. During product launch, Autoco is
less competitive, providing lower value on order lead time and delivery reliability
than its competitor. Whereas, during steady state, when Autoco is more competi­
tive, it is perceived as providing value superior, or equal, to its competitor on all
dimensions except quality. This suggests that SKUs m ight be segmented in terms
of stage in product life cycle, although to confirm this, other customers' percep­
tions of value would be required. We return to the concept of 'value' in Chapter 3.
Once appropriate supply chain strategy drivers have been selected, a driver
matrix can be developed like that used by Kimberly-Clark (K-C) in Case study
2.5, where specific elements of profiles (in the K-C case, demand variability and
demand volume) are used to segment the SKUs and tailored supply chain strategies
are developed for each quadrant. Another driver matrix is presented in Chapter 7
(Section 7.3) where specific elements of the competitive profile (lead time and
delivery frequency) and demand profile (demand variability) are used to segment
the SKUs and drive segmented supply chain strategy.

launch and steady state

2.5.4 The four-step approach to developing segmented
supply chain strategy
After studying segmented supply chain strategy with many companies over more
than a decade, Godsell (2012) claims:
A major inhibitor to the m ore widespread adoption o f SC segm entation is the
con fusion caused by the vast array o f com plicated m odels presented by consultants
and academ ics to address the issue. A problem exacerbated by con fusion as to w h o
the custom er actually is? Is it the consumer, the store, the regional w arehouse or




end market? The problem becom es so com plicated that organisations don't k now
where to begin. The key is to start sim ple and on ly get m ore com p lex if required. As
obvious as it m ay sound this has been a major enabler in the organisations where
segm entation has been successfully im plem ented.

There are four steps proposed:
• Step 1: Identify the customer demand signal to which the supply chain will
respond.
• Step 2: Conduct a demand profiling analysis using demand volume and
variability.
• Step 3: Identify the key supply chain segments.
• Step 4: Develop tailored practices for each of the supply chain functions
involved.
The four steps are illustrated in the Kimberly-Clark (K-C) Europe Case study 2.5.

CASE STUDY

2.5

Segmented supply chain strategy process at
Kimberly-Clark Europe
For more than a century, Kimberly Clark (K-C) has supplied personal care products and
now can claim that nearly a quarter of the world's population, across 175 countries, use
their products.
The K-C product range spans personal care, healthcare and professional ranges and
includes household brands such as Huggies nappies, Kleenex tissues and Kotex sanitary
towels. This case concerns the consumer K-C products sold through K-C Europe and
illustrates how K-C followed the four-step approach to developing segmented supply
chain strategy.

Step 1: Id en tify th e custom er dem an d signal
First it is necessary to map out the end-to-end supply chain to provide visibility across
the business. Galbraith (1983) conceptualised the extended supply chain from raw
materials through to the retailer (end-to-end) and this is echoed by many organisations
who talk of 'seed to smoke' (tobacco) or 'farm to fork (food) strategies. However, such
a broad scope or wide 'arc of integration' (Frohlich and Westbrook, 2001), as described
in Section 8.1, is difficult to manage.
We propose that it is desirable to understand the end-to-end supply chain but, in
the development of segmented SC strategy, it is im portant to identify a set of primary
customers to which the supply chain responds, and these, it could be argued, are the
customers for the supply chain. Unfortunately, the real world is complex, particularly in
the field of SCM, where an SC has many different customers.
The simplified end-to-end supply chain for K-C Europe is shown in Figure 2.14. The
primary customers for K-C Europe are the retailers and this is the demand signal for
the supply chain. The point at which demand is decoupled from supply is referred to
as the 'decoupling point'. This is where a strategic stock is maintained speculatively in
order to respond quickly (and with potentially lower inventory levels) to changes in retailer



Figure 2.14

The simplified end-to-end supply chain for K-C Europe

demand. Ideally, the retailer shares the point of sale (POS) data representing consumer
demand, but typically this isn't the case and K-C is reliant on the retailers' inventory
management, which can induce the bullwhip effect, sometimes referred to as demand
amplification. The position of the decoupling point, for each SKU, depends on the
location of K-C manufacturing relative to the market served. Where K-C manufacturing
is local to the market (typically for the high volume, commoditised manufacture that
generates economies of scale) it is possible for the decoupling point to be further up
the supply chain, at the inbound pulp for the K-C factory, thus enabling a considerable
reduction in the value of inventory. If K-C manufacturing is remote to the market
(as is often the case for the specialised products, which are manufactured in relatively low
volumes and therefore manufactured centrally), the decoupling point is in the distribution
centres local to the market served.
Tip : Leading practice has shown that organisations with a track record in implement­
ing segmented supply chains have just started with the actual demand signal that they
receive from the customer (it is the one they need to respond to) and accept that it is
likely to be subject to the bullwhip effect, which is the phenomenon where variations in
end-customer demand are amplified as you move upstream.
Step 2: C onduct a dem an d profiling analysis
Once the correct demand signal has been identified, it is then possible to do the demand
profiling analysis. Experience has shown that it is best to start simple, with an analysis of
demand volume and demand variability (indicated by the, coefficient of variation, CV)
for the SKUs in a given region, end-market or category, as illustrated in Figure 2.15 for
K-C Europe. K-C identified the category level w ithin a region as the most appropriate
level at which to begin the analysis.
Step 3: Id en tify th e key supply chain segments
Where to 'draw the lines' to determine the segments is a decision specific to each
organisation. The most im portant thing is that the 'lines are drawn' in a way that is
meaningful to the organisation. In K-C Europe it was based initially on a simple 80:20
Pareto on volume (high:low) and 50:50 split on variability, which gave the four seg­
ments illustrated in Figure 2.16.

Figure 2.16

Four segments defined by K-C Europe

These segments were particularly informative in terms of comm unications between
supply chain function and marketing. For instance, in terms of managing the product
range it was clear that SKUs categorised as 'noise', subject to low volume yet highly vari­
able demand, were not desirable and should be eliminated or rationalised where possible.

Step 4: D evelop tailored practices fo r each of th e supply chain
functions involved
The final step is to develop the tailored practices fo r each o f the identified segments,
w hich involves ide n tifyin g w h a t each fu n ctio n needs to do to align supply w ith the
dem and fo r the respective SKU segments. Tailored practices ca n n o t be copied and
pasted fro m one organisation to another. They need to be developed to m eet the
specific organisational co n te xt and those developed fo r K-C Europe are shown in
Table 2.7.
The sales forecasting approach was m ainly d e p e ndent on dem and variability,
so 'selective statistical' and 'steady state' SKUs (subject to low dem and variability)

Summary
What is customer service in the context of logistics?

• Marketing is defined as 'the activity, set of institutions and processes for
creating, communicating, delivering and exchanging offerings that have
value for customers, partners and society at large'. Loyal customers are seen
as the source of profit, growth and security. Marketing, in practice, starts with
analysing segments, evaluating those segments and targeting them. Segments
need to be measurable, economically viable, accessible and actionable.
Marketing, in practice, continues by market positioning, which requires
differential advantage to be defined, and the marketing mix to be formulated.
• The key logistics contribution to the marketing mix is in the 'fourth P':
place. This includes decisions about factors such as channel selection, market
coverage, distribution systems and dealer support. Logistics also supports
product decisions (for example, product range) and promotion activity.
• An important logistics contribution to putting the end-customer first is to
forecast demand. This can be undertaken using judgemental forecasting (where
no demand history exists) or by causal forecasting (where historical data are
available).
• Business to business (B2B) refers to relationships between businesses. Business to
consumer (B2C) refers to relationships between businesses and consumers, and
these are always the end-customers in a supply chain, although the end-customer
can be a business, as is the case for industrial products, e.g. aero engines.
• Supply networks end with service processes, where the end-customer is present
in some way. 'Gaps' can emerge between what the service is supposed to be,
what the customer expects it to be, and how the customer perceives it when
it is delivered. The size of these gaps has implications for quality of service, a
major driver of customer loyalty.
How do we win and retain customers through supply chain managem ent?

• The principle here is that loyal customers have many advantages over new
ones. The logistics challenge is to reinforce loyalty by exceeding customer
expectations via superior quality of service.
• Customer relationship management is based on the principle that marketing
strategies should be extended continuously to strengthen customer loyalty.
Phases of logistics development are needed, each phase placing increasing
demands on the development of logistics capabilities.
• There naturally exists a tension between the demand creation objectives of
marketing and the demand fulfilment objectives of supply chain management;
what matters is how the conflict can be resolved to meet customer needs
efficiently. Segmented supply chain strategy offers one of a number of
approaches to achieving this.
• The segmented approach is based on the idea that 'one size does not fit all'
when it comes to supply chain strategy and that developing multiple strategies


determined by drivers - demand, competitive and product - can simultane­
ously improve customer service and efficiencies.
• Selecting the appropriate supply chain strategy drivers is not easy and we
present two approaches: one based on the extent to which the driver varies
across the range of SKUs; and the other using the value delivered by the
focal firm, from the customer's perspective, compared to that delivered by
competitors - customer value gap analysis.
• We present a four-step approach to developing segmented supply chain strategy,
which involves: identifying the demand signal to which the supply chain will
respond; demand profiling on the basis of demand volume and variability;
identifying the key supply chain segments; and developing tailored practices
for each supply chain function.

Discussion questions

5 The barbecue sauce focal firm described in Section 2.3 has manufacturing facilities
in the Netherlands w hich are described as 'high on quality and reliability, b u t low on

flavour are made so th a t process cleanouts (each lasting > fo u r hours) are kept to
a m inim um . After m anufacturing, each batch of a given flavour is transported to
an off-site finishing operation, where bottles of the different flavours are packed
into a display box fo r attractive presentation to the end-customer at the firm 's retail
customers. This process takes an average o f tw o weeks because o f the need to ensure
th a t all flavours are available. Finally, the display boxes are distributed through
warehousing operations w hich have been situated in six carefully selected locations
around the product's m ajor European market in Germany.
M anagem ent of the focal firm is under pressure to reduce inventories and stock
w rite-offs (the sauce has a shelf life of three m onths). Propose w ha t actions could
be taken to im prove the supply chain to perm it im proved responsiveness to endcustom er demand.

Introduction
In Section 1.3 we reviewed the way in which different products may have differ­
ent logistics strategies. Whilst the range of classic shirts compete on price and
brand, and demand is relatively stable over the year, fashion blouses compete on
style, responsiveness to market and brand. For a fashion product, the logistics
challenge is to be able to support highly uncertain demand in the marketplace.




The logistics task for the two supply chains is essentially different, and some com­
panies refer to a 'supply chain for every product' to emphasise this difference. In
Chapter 2, we stated the need for compromise here - between 'one size fits all'
on the one hand, and endless customisation of the supply chain on the other,
proposing an approach to segmenting supply chain strategy.
Here, we develop the information flow aspects of our model in Figure 1.4. We
also show how there is another flow in supply chains - funds flow. Funds flow in
the opposite direction to materials. Funds - in the form of cash - originate from
the end-customer, and are used to pay the bills progressively from one supply
chain partner to the next upstream.
W hilst funds flow has not yet been formally included in the logistics do­
m ain, the integration of finance and logistics is an increasingly im portant
aspect of logistics in the 21st century. The acquisition of Vastera (a third party
logistics company) by JP Morgan Chase Bank (a financial institution), to form
JP Morgan Chase Vastera, is aimed at 'driving cost savings and global supply
chain efficiencies whilst providing best-in-class compliance w ith governm ent
regulations'.
This chapter probes the financial implications of different logistics strategies.
Whilst it may be clear that cost must form a central plank of supply chain strat­
egy for classic shirts, the product team for fashion blouses cannot ignore the cost
implications of their actions (see Table 1.2). The common them e is the concept
of value, and the extent to which both management teams are creating value
for the end-customer. In this chapter, we advance the concept of 'value' beyond
the mainly end-customer view that we took in Chapter 2, and extend it to other
stakeholders in the supply chain.
Whilst value is based on cost from the point of view of the company accoun­
tant, the concept of value may have different interpretations outside the com­
pany. In Section 2.5.3, we stated that value from the end-customer's point of view
is the perceived benefit gained from a product/service compared with the cost of
purchase. From the shareholder's point of view, value is determined by the best
alternative use of a given investment. In other words, value is greatest where the
return on investment is highest.

The chapter assumes a basic knowledge of a profit/loss account and balance
sheet. If finance is not your long suit, then a helpful accompanying financial
text is Accounting and Finance for Non-specialists (Atrill and McLaney, 2012). We
acknowledge the assistance from our colleague at Cranfield School of Management,
Dr Simon Templar, for his help with Sections 3.3 and 3.6 on liquidity and capital
investment decisions respectively and also for sharing his wealth of knowledge on
accounting and finance for the supply chain. We also acknowledge Sri Srikanthan,
for his help with Sections 3.2 and 3.4.

3.1 Where does value come from?
Key issues: How can shareholder value be defined and w hat is its relationship with
customer value? How can shareholder value be measured?

Creating shareholder value is used widely today to describe the main objective of
a business. Shareholder value is the financial value created for shareholders by the
companies in which they invest. In its simplest form, shareholder value is created
when the shareholder gets a better return by investing in your business than from
a comparable investment. A comparable investment is one that has a similar level of
risk. You might make the same return on €100,000 from playing roulette as you do
from buying a house, but the risk profiles are very different! In order for a business
to create superior shareholder value, it must have a competitive advantage.
Customer value is determined from the customer's point of view and is the
perceived benefit gained from a product/service compared with the cost of pur­
chase (as described in Section 2.5.3). In effect, the customer evaluates the benefit
derived from the product in the light of the cost (not just price) of purchase, so
a low cost product may not be perceived as high value if the benefits are propor­
tionally lower than that of a more expensive product.
You should be aware that there is a debate in the literature over which of these
values, shareholder or customer, should take priority. Some argue that organi­
sations are in business primarily to maximise shareholder value (Cornelius and
Davies, 1997; Rappaport, 1987) and can do so by also delivering customer value
and therefore m aintaining competitiveness. Others have argued that alignment
with customer needs comes first because a business is more likely to achieve its
goals when it organises itself to meet the current, and potential, needs of custom­
ers more effectively than its competitors (Doyle, 1994; Drucker, 2001; Copulsky,
1991; Laitamaki and Kordupleski, 1997).
An alternative to this trade-off perspective is that organisations need to be able
to balance between the two (Feurer and Chaharbaghi, 1994; Cleland and Bruno,




84

Chapter 3 • Value and logistics costs

1997) as shareholder and customer value can be conflicting and can destroy each
other. For instance Frohlich (2002) argued that the lack of alignment between
business models and practices and customer needs will have an adverse effect on
shareholder value.
In a way, customer value ensures customer loyalty and thus promises continuous
revenue and contributing to shareholder value, and shareholder value promises
continuous investment that supports the implementation of the business unit and
supply chain strategies to meet customer need (Slater and Narver, 1994; Kaplan
and Norton, 2004). From this perspective, shareholder value and customer value
appear to reinforce each other, meaning that shareholder value positively affects
customer value and vice versa.
In this chapter we will be concerned mainly with shareholder value and
how supply chain m anagement affects it, but it is clear that customer value (as
discussed in Chapter 2) is inextricably linked to shareholder value. There are
two ways to measure shareholder value - market-based external measures and
internal measures. We shall focus on the internal measures by first considering
conventional return on capital employed (ROCE), which is used widely to assess
shareholder value.

3.2 How can conventional return on capital employed
(ROCE) be measured?
Key issue: W hat is return on capital employed and how can supply chain manage­
m ent affect it?

One way of looking at the creation of shareholder value is to think about ending
the year with a lot more m oney than at the start. If this extra money results from
profitable trading, then m anagement has been successful in improving the produc­
tivity o f capital. Return on capital employed (ROCE) is measured as profit (in €)
before interest and tax as a percentage of capital employed (also in €):
% ROCE = 100 x € P rofit/€ Capital em ployed

Capital employed is equivalent to the money invested in the business. ROCE
can also be seen as the outcome of profitability and asset utilisation:

3.2.1

ROCE and implications for supply chain management
Let us look at the detail behind each of these ratios, and the way they fit in with
each other. Figure 3.1 provides a family tree of the way ROCE is made up. Let us
look at the potential for improving each from a point of view of managing the
supply chain better.

Sales

Superior customer service improves sales, and makes a focal firm more valued by
the customer in the long term.
• Improving customer responsiveness is a key goal for managing the supply
chain, as discussed in Chapter 2.
Costs

The supply chain is a potential gold mine for making bottom-line improvements
to business performance. But directors of many businesses are im patient for cost
improvement, and consider that cutting stocks and headcount is the primary
task - as in the 'evolution' strategy in Figure 1.10. This may achieve short-term
margin improvement, but strategic supply chain managem ent is, more impor­
tantly, concerned with process improvement over the long term.
• Supply chain modelling shows that manufacturing and distribution costs,
together with inventories, can be optimised whilst customer service is maxi­
mised.
• Studies in efficient consumer response (ECR) have shown that cutting out nonvalue-added products and inefficient promotional activity can reduce overall
costs by 6 per cent. (ECR is discussed in Chapter 6.)




Working capital

Note that the sum of inventory, cash and accounts receivable less accounts pay­
able is called working capital. Each of the elements of working capital is consid­
ered in turn.

Inventory

This is a major asset in many businesses. It is there to buffer uncertainty of supply
and demand, and to permit immediate availability when replenishment times are
too lengthy. However, inventory is regarded often as a hindrance rather than a
help: it ties up cash, it needs resources to be stored and it becomes obsolete.
• A primary goal for supply chain managem ent is to replace inventory with
information. Try to minimise the use of forecasts and to increase the use of
real-time demand data.
• Question any means for automatically replenishing inventory (such as the
reorder level used in stock control, described in Section 6.1.2).

Cash an d accounts receivable

The key task here is to make the time between receipt of customer order and
receipt of the cash as short as possible. Progress against this ideal not only makes
the company more competitive by reducing lead times, but also improves its cash
position. This means that business processes from sales order processing to distri­
bution should be integrated and free from waste.
• Accounts receivable (customers who owe us money) can be minimised by basic
controls such as regular review and problem resolution. Sending out incom ­
plete or inaccurate invoices is an invitation for delays or even non-payment!

Accounts payable

Accounts payable are companies to whom we owe money. In supply chain terms,
this term applies mainly to our suppliers. Many organisations think that lengthy
payment terms to suppliers maximise credit and therefore improve the balance
sheet. The downside of this thinking is that suppliers factor in the credit terms to
their prices, as their own balance sheets become saddled with debt.
• Plan material requirements and distribution requirements to maximise flow of
parts through the supply chain as needed.
• Discipline goods inwards to check delivery date, quality and correct prices.
There is no point in starting the credit cycle early by accepting goods before
they are due.
• If the supplier is a smaller company, it may be that the cost of capital is higher
than it is for your company. It may then be worthwhile to consider negotiating
with the supplier to pay early, and therefore getting a share of the money that
the supplier is paying in interest to the bank.


Fixed assets (n ow known as non-current assets)

The value-generating assets of a business that form the focus of supply chain
managem ent are a heavy drain on capital. They include manufacturing facili­
ties, warehousing and distribution. They contribute to high fixed costs for an
operation: that is, costs that do not change much with throughput. Such costs
are therefore highly volume sensitive, as we shall see.
• Many organisations respond by a 'maximum variable, m inim um fixed' policy.
This refers to keeping fixed costs to a m inim um , and is helped by outsourcing
all but the core capabilities, which are retained inhouse. Outsourced
processes can then be cut more easily in the event of a dow nturn, such
as the recession of 2009/10. Thus transport and warehousing today often
are outsourced to specialist 'third party logistics providers' such as DHL, Exel
and UPS.

egories can be influenced (made better or worse) in an organisation.
2 W hat are the im plications fo r logistics strategy?

3.2.2 Financial ratios and ROCE drivers
ROCE is an important measure for assessing shareholder value and is under­
pinned by two m ain drivers:
• increased profitability;
• increased asset utilisation.
As discussed at the beginning of Section 3.2, these two supporting drivers are
the key determinants for increasing ROCE and hence shareholder value. An u n ­
derstanding of the financial ratios that affect these two drivers is essential when
formulating a focal firm's supply chain strategy. Whilst financial ratios are based
on historical information, and therefore have limitations, they have a num ber of
advantages for an organisation. They can be:
• a benchmark for comparing one organisation with another;
• used as a comparator for a particular industrial sector;
• used to track past performance;
• a motivator for setting performance targets;
• an early warning indicator if the organisation's performance starts to decline.
Table 3.1 provides a guide to linking ROCE and its drivers with the financial
ratios for a manufacturing company (CIMA, 2005).
We now turn to the criticality of cash flow, its impact on shareholder value and
the implications for supply chain management.

3.3 Why is liquidity important and what are the
implications for supply chain management?
Key issue: W hy is liquidity im portant and how can supply chain m anagem ent

balance the objectives of profitability, liquidity and asset utilisation?

There are three key areas where supply chain managem ent can affect an organi­
sation's financial performance: profitability, liquidity and productivity or asset
utilisation (Christopher, 2011). Profitability and asset utilisation are covered by
ROCE (see the last section) but liquidity is not considered by ROCE. Yet the widely
held view of Warren Buffett (1994) is that, ultimately, the value of a business to
its owners (shareholders) is determined by the net present value (NPV, described
in Section 3.6) of the cash flows occurring from the business's operations over its
lifetime.
In response to the importance of liquidity, Johnson and Templar (2011) devel­
oped a proxy for supply chain performance (called the 'supply chain ratio') to
explain the relationship between supply chain and firm performance. The supply
chain proxy (a model for which is shown in Figure 3.2) is closely related to ROCE.
However, rather than considering operating profit, it uses 'net cash inflow from
operations', and introduces the change in working capital (indicated by 'A Work­
ing capital'):

The model (shown in Figure 3.2) shows examples of potential tactical
decisions that could impact the strategic imperatives that drive the proxy and

the potential positive and negative trade-offs that should be quantified before
im plementing an initiative. The challenge for the supply chain manager is to
develop a com bination of initiatives that will lead to an increase in the supply
chain ratio.
Reductions in working capital have a beneficial effect on an organisation's sup­
ply chain ratio (and its ROCE). For example, inventory reductions increase both
profitability (by reducing costs) and asset utilisation (by reducing current assets,
as well as reducing cash to cash cycle times (or liquidity). The supply chain ratio
emphasises the importance of reducing working capital, such as inventory, on
cash-to-cash cycle times to improve liquidity.




Liquidity is the ability of an organisation to meet its obligations as and when
they fall due (Johnson and Templar, 2011). The use of time-related financial ratios
is key to monitoring the cash-to-cash cycle and liquidity. Key ratios, which reflect
the three key levers of liquidity, are:
• average inventory turnover: the num ber of times inventory is turned over in rela­
tion to the cost of goods sold;
• average settlement period for accounts receivable: the time taken for an organisa­
tion to be paid by its customers;
• average settlement period for accounts payable: the time taken for an organisation
to pay its suppliers.
The traditional view to improving liquidity is to take the single company's perspec­
tive (sometimes termed the 'vertical' approach). Here liquidity can be improved by
reducing days of accounts receivable from customers and increasing days of accounts
payable to suppliers. However, it is not difficult to see how this could place adverse
pressure on these relationships and lead to both dissatisfied suppliers and customers.
Therefore, from the perspective of the 'vertical' approach, reducing inventory levels
and increasing inventory turns is the main supply chain lever for improving liquid­
ity, as discussed earlier in this section. In any case, a supply chain manager does not
have control over accounts receivable (as this is typically within the sales function),
however they can have influence of accounts payable, in relation to procurement.
Liquidity, as accounts payable and receivable suggest, is related to supply chain
relationships and both the causes and effects of liquidity are related to the wider
supply chain. It follows that a supply chain perspective (sometimes termed the
'horizontal' approach) is more appropriate, where each company in the chain
considers the impact their accounts payable terms (days to pay suppliers) has
on their suppliers' cash-to-cash cycle times. After all, one company's accounts
payable is the next company's accounts receivable. Further, days of accounts re­
ceivable may well be factored into prices, as there is a cost of borrowing cash to
support days of accounts receivable. Case study 3.1 shows how liquidity can vary
dramatically across the different companies in a supply chain and the impact of
both the traditional vertical approach and the horizontal supply chain approach
on liquidity. The case, which uses data from a real life supply chain, clearly illus­
trates how the horizontal supply chain approach can rebalance liquidity across
the supply chain to the benefit of the supply chain as a whole.

Improving liquidity across an FMCG food supply chain
Food supply chains are driven often by retailers and this holds fo r this case, w hich
features a food sold in supermarkets th a t can be classed as a fast m oving consumer
good (FMCG). Table 3.2 illustrates the cash-to-cash cycle times fo r three companies in
the supply chain: the retailer, the food processor and the main raw material supplier.
The supermarket chain has good cash flo w w ith, on average, eight days of credit. There­
fore, no borrow ing is required to support cash flow. However, both the food processor and
the raw material suppliers require borrowing, where they each have more than double
the days o f inventory held by the retailer and days of accounts receivable is also around

The arrows indicate th a t the days of accounts payable by the supermarket im pact

The retailer increases days o f accounts payable by six days, im proving their liquidity
fu rth e r to 14 days of credit w ith o u t borrow ing. This results in an increase o f fo u r days
o f accounts receivable fo r the food processor, w ho passes this on to its suppliers as an
increase in days of accounts payable, resulting in no change in the liq u id ity o f the food
processor. Finally, this results in an increase of three days in the accounts payable fo r the
raw material supplier, w hich they find d ifficu lt to pass on to their suppliers. So the raw
material supplier's liquidity deteriorates further to 45 days o f borrow ing, leaving this
supplier at increased risk of liquidation. Viewing the supply chain holistically, the 'verti­
cal' approach has led to a further imbalance in liquidity across the supply chain, w ith
the supermarket enjoying yet greater credit and the raw material supplier requiring even
higher levels o f borrow ing.

'H o rizo n tal' supply chain approach to im proving liquidity
If each organisation takes the 'horizontal' approach and aims to rebalance liq u id ity
across the supply chain by reducing the days o f accounts payable to suppliers, the
hypothetical im pact is shown in Table 3.4.

The retailer shares its liq u id ity w ith its suppliers by reducing the days o f accounts
payable by six days, reducing its ow n liq u id ity to - 2 days of credit w ith o u t borrow ing.
This results in a reduction of fo u r days o f accounts receivable fo r the food processor,
w h o passes this on to its suppliers as a reduction in days of accounts payable, resulting
once again in no change in the liq u id ity fo r the food processor. Finally, this results
in a reduction of three days in the accounts payable fo r the raw material supplier,
w hich they decide n o t to pass on to th e ir suppliers because they need to im prove
th e ir liquidity. So the raw material supplier's liq u id ity reduces to 39 days o f borrow ing,
reducing the risk th a t this supplier w ill go into liquidation. View ing the supply chain
holistically the 'h orizo n ta l' approach has led to a rebalancing o f liq u id ity across the
supply chain, reduced credit (w hilst still n o t b o rro w in g ) and the raw material supplier
being able to reduce its levels of borrow ing.

Q uestions

1 Considering the 'horizontal' approach, argue w hy the retailer should reduce further
the days of accounts payable. W hat will be the im pact on the relationship between all
three members of the supply chain?
2 Considering the 'horizontal' approach, how w ill the changes im pact the supply chain
ratio fo r the retailer?
3 Try building in plausible inventory reductions across the supply chain fo r the
'horizontal' approach. W hat is the effect on the cash cycle times?

The supply chain ratio allows the trade-offs across profitability, liquidity and
asset utilisation to be managed. This is important for m aintaining liquidity, as it
can suffer as a result of pursuing either profitability or asset utilisation improve­
ments. For example, chasing profitability by extending payment terms to cus­
tomers may increase sales revenue, but can cause liquidity problems by increasing
cash-to-cash cycle times. Alternatively, seeking higher utilisation levels of m anu­
facturing assets can lead to lower costs per unit but also can result in excessive
finished stock. This results in cash being tied up for longer and higher inventory
management costs (e.g. storage, insurance, obsolescence).
Perhaps most im portant of all is that the supply chain ratio allows supply chain
directors and managers to have a dialogue at board level by acknowledging that
supply chains are an enabler, not an impediment, to superior firm performance.
We now turn to issues concerning the visibility of costing information, which
is im portant for evaluating the financial performance of a supply chain, whether
seeking ways to improve it or making capital investment decisions, as later
described in Section 3.6.

3.4 How can logistics costs be represented?
Key issue: W hat are the various ways of cutting up the total cost 'cake', and what
are the relative merits of each?

We all have a pretty good idea of what the total costs of a business are in practice.
The costs of items such as materials used, power and wages all lead to bills that
have to be paid. W hat is not so clear is how these costs should be allocated to
supply chain processes - or even to products, for that matter. Figure 3.3 shows
a breakdown of the costs of producing a bottle of mineral water against its total
sales price, showing the approximate proportions of each. Starting at the bottom:
• Manufacturing costs: of extracting the water from source, testing, purifying and
bottling. Add on the costs of plastic and labels for the bottles.
• Transport costs: from bottling plant to the supplier's national distribution cen­
tre (NDC) in a given territory





Figure 3.3

Cost breakdown of a bottle of mineral water

• Processing costs: in the supplier's NDC.
• Transport costs: from the supplier's NDC to the retailer's regional distribution
centre (RDC).
• Processing costs: in the retailer's RDC.
• Processing costs: in the retailer's store.
The balance of the sales revenue, less costs, is shared between supplier and re­
tailer as profit (or 'margin'). But how are costs allocated to product lines (for ex­
ample, plastic bottles, glass bottles, facial spray) and individual SKUs (for example,
1.5 litre, 500 ml)?
This section reviews three com m only used ways of representing costs: fixed
and variable, direct and indirect, and engineered and discretionary. Bear
in m ind that the total cost picture is the same: the three different ways of
allocating them to products are simply different ways of 'cutting the cake'. Let
us look at total cost as a cube instead of a cake. Then the three different ways
of representing costs can be shown as different ways of cutting up the cube
(Figure 3.4).

Three ways to cut the 'total cost cube'

The important point here is that the total cost is constant: it is the ways we
analyse that cost that are different. Why analyse it in different ways? To gain

better information about our cost basis so that we can manage the business better.
Let us look in turn at each of these ways to cut the total cost cube.

3.4.1

Fixed/variable
One popular way of analysing costs is to consider the effect of volume o f activity on
them. Costs tend to respond differently as the volume changes:
• fixed costs tend to stay the same as volume of activity changes, or at least within
a given volume range;
• variable costs change as the volume of activity changes.
Fixed costs include items such as warehouse rental, which is charged on a time
basis (€/month). As volume of activity increases, additional warehouses may be
added around Europe, and we get the familiar stepped fixed costs, as shown in
Figure 3.5. The same relationship would apply if volumes were reduced and a
warehouse closed.
Variable costs include things such as direct materials, which are ordered in line
with demand. If demand increases, we buy more. Starting with zero cost at zero
activity, variable costs increase roughly in line with volume, as shown in Figure 3.6.
If we add the variable costs to the fixed costs against a given range of volume
(so that the fixed costs remain completely fixed), and add in the sales revenue
(which also increases in line with volume), we arrive at the break-even chart
shown in Figure 3.7. The sloping line that starts at 0 is the sales revenue. The total
cost line starts at F, and represents the sum of fixed and variable costs. The point
at which the sales revenue line crosses the total cost line is the break-even point.
Below this point, a loss will be incurred; above it a profit will be made.





Figure 3.5

Rent cost against volume of activity

Break-even chart


A helpful concept in evaluating break-even charts is that of contribution:
Contribution = Sales less variable costs
Therefore, contribution is the fixed costs plus the profit. Contribution is useful
in decision making. High contribution per unit indicates a more volatile busi­
ness: that is, one that is more risky. Therefore, we should expect a business with
high contribution/unit to provide a higher return on investment in the longer
term. Look at the two break-even charts in Figures 3.8 and 3.9. W hat are the

Figure 3.8

Figure 3.9

Break-even chart B

(Source: Courtesy of Sri Srikanthan)




differences between the two situations? W hat has happened to the break-even
point and why?
Chart A (Figure 3.8) shows a situation with high variable costs and low fixed
costs. In chart B (Figure 3.9), the situation is reversed. The break-even point has
moved well to the right: that is, chart B requires a higher volume to break-even
than A. This is because a much higher volume of sales is needed to cover the high
level of fixed costs.
Furthermore, additional volume has a small impact on chart A, whereas it has
a much higher impact on chart B. So high fixed costs and low variable costs
lead to greater volume sensitivity. Accordingly, profitability (the area above the
break-even point) is affected much more by volume changes in chart B. In terms
of contribution, chart A represents a situation with low contribution/unit, and
therefore low risk in comparison with chart B.
The supply chain implications of such considerations are th at most often we
are faced with chart B situations. For example, core resources such as warehous­
ing and distribution systems create little opportunity to reduce investments
in line with reducing sales volumes other th an the step changes shown in
Figure 3.5. We are back to the advice for increasing ROCE given in Section 3.2
above: to increase sales and reduce costs. The reassuring point is that every 1
per cent increase in sales or 1 per cent reduction in costs has a leveraged effect
on profits.

Bond SA - a marginal costing example
Bond SA is planning to manufacture a new product w ith an initial sales forecast of
3,600 units in the first year at a selling price o f €800 each. The finance departm ent
has calculated th a t the variable cost fo r each truck w ill be €300. The fixed costs fo r
the manufacturing facility fo r the year are €1,500,000. Using the inform ation provided
by the sales forecast and the finance departm ent, it is now possible to calculate the
planned profit, the co n tribution and the break-even p o in t fo r this venture (as shown in
Table 3.5) by leveraging the nature of fixed and variable costs.

If Bond SA achieves its sales forecast o f 3,600 units, then the com pany w ill make a

3,000 units, at w hich p o in t Bond SA makes no p ro fit b u t also no loss, because sales
revenue (€2,400,000) equals all the variable costs (€900,000) and all the total fixed


costs associated w ith the production process (€1,500,000). Any additional unit sold
after this p o in t w ill provide Bond w ith profitable sales revenue. The difference between
the planned p ro fit and the break-even p o in t is called the margin o f safety. In the case of
Bond SA, this equates to 600 units.

Q uestions

W hat happens to the break-even p o in t if:
1 Fixed costs increase by 10 per cent?
2 The sales price reduces by 5 per cent?

3.4.2 Direct/indirect
Another way to cut up the total cost 'cube' is to analyse costs in terms of whether
or not they can be allocated directly to a given product. Two further categories
emerge:
• Direct costs can be tied to specific products. The most obvious examples are
direct labour and direct materials. Thus we can allocate exactly the cost of
bought-in parts to the products into which they are built.
• Indirect costs are whatever is left over after direct costs have been allocated.
Indirect costs are also called 'overheads', and include everything from the
managing director's salary to the rent rates paid for the distribution centre anything that cannot be allocated directly to a given product.
Directness of costs is concerned with the extent to which costs can be allocated
directly to given products. This is a completely different concept from that of
fixed/variable costs. Whilst there is a tendency to associate fixed costs with indi­
rect and variable with direct, there is no necessary relationship at all. Thus direct
labour costs tend to be fixed, at least in the short term.
As stated above, the reason for analysing costs differently is to gain better
information about our cost basis so th at we can manage the business better. Direct
and indirect costs help us to decide the full cost of a product or service when
more th an one is offered. If there were just a single product, life would be easy,
because all of the costs could be allocated to that one product. Most businesses
are m uch more complex than that, and are faced with the issue of how indirect
costs should be apportioned to products. The most popular way to spread
indirect costs is on the basis of direct labour. This is not the 'correct way', nor
is it the only way.
A closer view of how fixed costs behave by product is achieved by using a
m ethod called direct product profitability (DPP). This m ethod has been used widely
in the retail industry to understand the way in which logistics costs behave for




each product. The understanding is achieved by allocating fixed costs, making
assumptions about how these are incurred by a product as it moves through the
logistics system.
A good DPP system should take account of all the significant differences in the
ways products are developed, sourced, produced, sold and distributed. In order to
make this analysis practical, products normally will need to be grouped together.
Product groups need to recognise shared technologies, processes, fixed assets, raw
material inputs and packaging methods. The key objective of product groupings
is to remove the need for apportioning costs, and thereby not to apportion profit
across the products.
An example DPP is shown for a m anufacturing com pany in Table 3.6. Note
th a t n o t all of the fixed costs have been assigned. DPP assumes th at only those
costs th at can be allocated rationally m ay be deducted. Thus DPP may be
viewed as a developm ent of direct/indirect costing in th at it attem pts to con­
vert into direct costs logistics costs that otherwise would have been regarded
as fixed. In this way, DPP seeks to provide more accurate inform ation about
which products are contributing most to profitability - and which are contrib­
uting least.

The principle at stake here is that good accounting and financial analysis
force us to ask more questions about w hat is going on in our business. DPP can
have a role to play here: it attempts to allocate logistics costs more specifically
to products (and, in this case, orders as well) than is possible by spreading 'fixed'
costs on the basis of an assumption such as direct labour. The assum ption other­
wise would be that direct labour actually 'drives' the overheads, which is highly
doubtful.


CASE STUDY

3.3

Direct product profitability
Filmco makes tw o thin film (gauge = 12 μm) products fo r packaging applications in the
food industry. Product A is coated so th a t subsequently it can be printed on; product B
is uncoated. There is no changeover tim e on the production line, because all th a t needs
to happen is fo r the coating drum to be switched on or off. Once produced on the
film -m aking lines, the film is slit to w id th and length to customer order. Roughly
40 per cent of Filmco's o u tp u t is A, and 60 per cent B, and film -m aking takes place
360 days/year on a continuous basis because of the high capital cost o f the process.
A DPP study was carried o u t at Filmco to determ ine the relative profitability of the
tw o products A and B by m ajor customer. The m ethod was adapted from th a t shown
in Table 3.1 because Filmco is a manufacturing environm ent. Here is how it was done:
a Invoice price: this was the total sales value invoiced to the customer,

b Cost of placing orders: the total cost of the sales office (salaries, etc.) was divided by the
num ber of orders dispatched th a t m onth. This cost per order (€150) was allocated to
each order placed by each customer.
c Manufacturing cost: a variable cost fo r each p ro d u ct was found by collecting raw
material, labour, power, packaging and waste costs. M anufacturing overheads (fixed
costs) were allocated on the basis of direct labour. Because of the small difference in
manufacturing methods, the manufacturing costs fo r the tw o products were similar.
They were €2,107 fo r A and €2,032 fo r B.

d Storage costs: the total cost of the warehousing operation is €800k/year. There are
8,300 pallet locations, and the cost/day fo r a pallet was calculated as €0.30, assuming
360 w orking days. The storage cost fo r a given order was calculated as the num ber of
pallets x the num ber o f days x €0.30.
e Opportunity costs: orders must w ait in the warehouse until the last reel has been pro­
duced. An order w ith a value o f €3,000 th a t stays fo r seven days in the warehouse
w ith an interest rate of 14 per cent is said to have an o p p o rtu n ity cost of €8.20.
f Transport cost: this was based on a price per tonne delivered to a given customer,
g Total cost: this was the sum o f b to f fo r a given order,
h DPP: this was sales price less total cost g.
Table 3.7 gives a sample o f the DPPs fo r four orders fo r customer P. The average DPP
fo r customer P over all orders shipped over a given m onth was 19.6 per cent, w hilst that
fo r custom er Q was 23.1 per cent and customer R was 33 per cent.

3.4.3 Engineered/discretionary
A third way of analysing costs is to consider the ease o f allocating them . Some
things are easy to cost; others may require considerable thought and analysis
because they are difficult to cost under current methods. This line of thinking
creates a third way of cutting the total cost cube:
• Engineered costs have a clear input-output relationship. In other words, the
benefit of a given cost is measurable. For example, if it takes 10 hours to pro­
duce 10 boxes of product A in the factory, then we have a clear output benefit
(1 box) for the cost of each hour of input.
• Discretionary costs do not have a clear input-output relationship. Here, the
input cost is clear but the output benefit is unclear. For example, the cost of the
contract cleaners who clean the factory is clear, but the benefit they produce is
not easily quantifiable.
The challenge is to convert discretionary costs into engineered costs, so that
we can better quantify the competitive impact of a given course of action. A clas­
sic example of converting discretionary costs into engineered costs has been the
conversion of 'quality' as a discretionary concept into engineered 'quality costs'
(Dale and Plunkett, 1995). This was achieved by breaking down the concept of
quality into three cost drivers:
• Prevention. This comprises the costs of measures to prevent defects from taking
place, such as training and process capability studies.
• Appraisal. This comprises the costs incurred in detecting defects, which would
include testing and inspection.
• Internal and external failure. Internal costs are scrap, rework and the associated costs
of not getting it right the first time. External failure costs are rectification after prod­
ucts have reached the final customer, such as warranty claims, returns and repairs.
In this case, it was argued, greater investment in prevention would result in the
overall cost of quality being reduced over time.
The principle is to convert discretionary costs into engineered costs where pos­
sible. As indicated in the above examples, it is usually possible to make an esti­
mate of what the engineered costs are, perhaps accompanied by a sensitivity or
risk analysis. W ithout such guidelines, decisions would have to be taken on 'gut
feel' - or, as usually happens, not taken at all! In other words, the logistics team
may have an excellent project for increased flexibility in the distribution centre
but, because they have not quantified the outputs (for example, the cost savings),
the application for funding is rejected.

3.4

Glup SA
Glup SA supplies a range o f household soaps to supermarkets in northern Europe. There
are 12 stock-keeping units (SKUs) in the range. The logistics manager has determ ined
th a t an investment of €0.5 m illion on im proved material handling equipm ent w ould
convert the main distribution centre into a more flexible facility. A num ber of benefits in


im proved product availability have been identified - b u t current inform ation is largely in
the form of discretionary costs. Glup's assessment of the benefits and its plans to convert
the justification into engineered costs are outlined below.

Im proved in-store availability
This is the percentage of time for which a product is available on the shelf. If the product is
not available on the shelf, then it will lose sales to competitive products that are available,
such as supermarket own brands. (Availability is a classic 'order losing sensitive' qualifying
criterion, as described in Section 1.3.) Current available data at Clup are scant, but suggest
that average in-store availability is as low as 85 per cent for a given SKU. In order to convert
this discretionary benefit into an engineered cost, Glup intends to measure the time for
which each of the 12 product lines is unavailable each week. One way to do this is to use a
market research agency to conduct sample studies of product availability in selected stores
at random times across the working week. This will yield an availability guide, such as the
85 per cent figure referred to. The new system will, it is believed, reduce this unavailable time.
Glup then plans to model the new material-handling equipm ent methods using simulation,
and to calculate the new in-store availability. The reduced non-availability time could then
be converted into additional contribution for each SKU to give an engineered cost saving.

Reduced transp ortation costs
The new equipm ent w ould also allow lower transportation costs, because trays of d if­
ferent SKUs could be mixed together on the same pallet. Glup again intends to use
simulation m odelling to identify the opportunities fo r savings using this m ethod. It is
considered th a t this w ill offer the o p p o rtu n ity to reduce overall transport costs by more
flexible loading o f the trailers used to distribute the products to Glup's customers.

Prom otions and n ew product launches
It is considered that the new equipm ent will enable promotions and new product launches
to be delivered to selected stores more accurately and more quickly. Demand uncertainty
in such situations is very high: fo r example, a recent 'three for the price of tw o ' prom otion
created a fivefold increase in sales. In order to launch a new product it is first necessary to
drain the pipeline of the old product, or to 'w rite it off' as obsolete stock. If the more flex­
ible warehouse system can reduce the length of the pipeline from factory to supermarket,
it is argued, then a real saving in tim e or obsolete stock is possible. Glup again intends to
measure this by simulation. It w ill then be necessary to determine by how much sales will
increase as a result of the new product advantages. This w ill be estimated by Glup market­
ing people, w ho w ill use experience of previous promotions and new product launches.
The engineered cost w ill be the additional tim e fo r which the new product is available
m ultiplied by the additional estimated sales volume m ultiplied by the contribution per
unit. Alternatively, it w ill be the reduction in obsolete stocks m ultiplied by the total cost
per product plus any costs of double handling and scrapping.

3.5 Activity-based costing (ABC)
Key issues: W hat are the shortcomings of traditional cost accounting from a
logistics point of view? How can costs be allocated to processes so that better
decisions can be made?

The driving force behind activity-based costing (ABC) is that the traditional way
of allocating indirect costs by spreading them to products on the basis of direct
labour is becoming difficult to manage. Whilst direct labour used to constitute a
substantial portion of product costs, today that rarely applies. Therefore, overhead
rates of 500 per cent or more on direct labour are not uncomm on. Just a small
change in direct labour content would lead to a massive change in product cost.
Cooper and Kaplan (1988) explain the problem by referring to two factories,
which we here refer to as Simple and Complex. Both factories produce 1 million
ballpoint pens each year; they are the same size and have the same capital equip­
ment. But whilst Simple produces only blue pens, Complex produces hundreds of
colour and style variations in volumes that range from 500 (lavender) to 100,000
(blue) units per year. A visitor would notice many differences between the fac­
tories. Complex has far more production support staff to handle the numerous
production loading and scheduling challenges, changeovers between colours
and styles, and so on. Complex would also have more design change issues, sup­
plier scheduling problems, and outbound warehousing, picking and distribution
challenges. There would be much higher levels of idle time, overtime, inventory,
rework and scrap because of the difficulty of balancing production and demand
across a much wider product range. Because overheads are allocated on the basis
of direct labour, blue pens are clobbered with 10 per cent of the m uch higher
Complex overheads. The market price of blue pens is determined by focused fac­
tories such as Simple, so the blue pens from Complex appear to be unprofitable.
As a result, the m anagement of Complex considers that specialist products such
as lavender - which sell at a premium - are the future of the business, and that
blue pens are low priority. This strategy further increases overheads and costs, and
perpetuates the m yth that the unit cost of each pen is the same. Traditional cost
systems often understate profits on high-volume products and overstate profits
on low-volume, high-variety products. ABC principles would help the manage­
m ent of Complex to make more informed product decisions on the basis of realis­
tic costs, as illustrated by Case study 3.5. The management of Simple has no need
for another costing system; the current one works well for them.
ABC recognises that overhead costs do not just happen, but are caused by
activities, such as holding products in store. ABC therefore seeks to break the
business down into major processes - such as manufacture, storage and distribu­
tion - and then break each process into activities. For example, the distribution
process would include such activities as picking, loading, transport and delivery.
For each of these activities, there must be one cost driver: what is it that drives
cost for that activity? For example, the cost driver for the storage activity may
be the volume of a case, whereas the transport activity may be driven by weight.
Once we know the cost driver, we need to know how m any units of that cost
driver are incurred for that activity, and the cost per unit for the cost driver. For


example, the cost driver for the transportation activity may be the number of
kilometres driven, and therefore cost per kilometre would be the cost per unit of
the cost driver. This yields the cost of the activity and, when summed across all of
the activities in a process, the total cost of that process.
ABC is difficult to implement because we need first to understand what the
discrete processes are in a business where the existing links between functions are
not well understood. There is then the issue of identifying the cost driver, which
requires a fresh way of looking at each activity. For example, the cost driver for
a warehouse fork-lift operator would be the num ber of pallets moved. The cost
driver for stocking shelves would be the num ber of pieces that must be stacked
in a given time period. A further problem occurs if there is more than one cost
driver for a given activity. You are then faced with the same problem as with over­
head allocation: on what basis should the cost drivers be weighted? Usually, this
problem shows that activities have not been broken down into sufficient detail,
and that more analysis is needed. ABC can therefore become resource-intensive
to implement.
In spite of the implementation challenges, logistics and ABC go hand in hand
(van Damme and van der Zon, 1999). It is a very rational way to analyse costs,
and logistics practitioners recognise that providing a service is about managing
a sequence of processes. Logistics or supply chain managers are particularly well
placed to understand, analyse and apply ABC. They understand business processes
and the activities that go with them. Theirs is a cross-functional task. The value
chain stares them in the face.
The procedure of determining cost drivers is often considered to be more valuable
than the ABC system itself. Activity-based management enables the cost structure of
a business to be examined in a new light (as illustrated by Case study 3.5), allowing
anomalies to be resolved and sources of waste highlighted. It may also help in
better targeting investment decisions.

CASE STUDY

3.5

ABC costing at Komplex GmbH
Komplex GmbH has fo u r production lines, each of w hich operates fo r 8,000 hours
a year. Each line makes a num ber of products, w hich are based on size and colour.
Therefore, many changeovers are required, each incurring set-up and maintenance
costs. Traditionally, the maintenance costs have been allocated on the basis of machine
hours, so each production line is charged equally. This year, the maintenance budget of
€1 m illion has been divided into four, so each line is charged w ith €250,000.
Sales and m arketing are concerned th a t certain products are losing market share, and
this is due to prices relative to the com petition. All departments have been instructed to
investigate costs and suggest improvements. How can activity-based costing improve
this situation? By identifying the cost driver fo r maintenance, in this case the num ber of
changeovers, costs can be allocated to each production line on this basis. Costs are then
matched to the activity th a t generates them , so avoiding cross-subsidies.
The results are illustrated in Table 3.8. Maintenance costs have now been transferred
to the production lines th a t incur the activity. For example, costs on line A have doubled
to €500,000, w hilst costs on line D have reduced to €50,000. ABC in this example




has n o t taken cost o u t of the process, b u t has reallocated the costs to give a better
understanding of the cost base. Komplex is now in a better position to make decisions
th a t affect the cost competitiveness of the product range.

Q uestions

1 For w hich other activities could the num ber of changeovers be a cost driver? Explain
your answer.
2 W hat is the likely effect on the costs fo r each production line compared to the equal
allocation?

We will now consider two costing approaches that are based on ABC costing:
cost - time profile (CTP) and cost to serve (CTS). Later in the book (in Chapter 9),
'total cost of ownership' (TCO), another ABC costing approach used by the pro­
curement function, is described.

3.5.1 Cost-time profile (CTP)
A key benefit of being able to cost logistics processes is that cost information can
be used in conjunction with time information. The synergies of the two can then
provide opportunities for identifying activities that create either value or waste.
The cost-time profile (CTP) (Bicheno, 2005) is a graph that plots cumulative
time against cumulative cost for a set of discrete activities, which together form a
process or a supply chain. The CTP utilises outputs from two sources:
• activity times: from the time-based process mapping (TBPM) process time re­
cording system (see Chapter 5);
• activity costs: from a process costing system that is underpinned by activitybased costing.
As discussed earlier, ABC strives to achieve an equitable distribution of over­
head costs to activities. Table 3.9 illustrates cumulative time and cost for a process
comprising six activities.

Such data can be used to construct a cost-tim e profile. Bernon, et al. (2003) re­
cord the process in terms of time and cost for a poultry product from receipt of
live bird to delivery of finished product to the retailer, as shown in Figure 3.10.
Overall, the process takes an average of 175 hours to complete. The profile shows
areas that consume time and cost within the supply chain, highlighting those for
future investigation that could yield savings. For example, distribution accounts
for 35 per cent of process time, but only 3 per cent of total cost. Slicing and pack­
aging are more in line, since they account for 25 per cent of total cost and are
responsible for 28 per cent of the total process time.

Figure 3.10

Cost-time profile for poultry product

(Source: After Bemon, et al., 2003, reprinted by permission of EIASM)

The profile shows that time and cost are not related linearly. Bicheno and Holweg
(2008) stress the importance of interpreting both the horizontal and vertical
lines of the CTP:
• Long, horizontal lines tend to occur when there is a relatively small increase in
total cost as a result of an activity that runs over a relatively long period of
time. An example is distribution of finished product after slicing and packing.
• Steep, vertical lines tend to occur when costs are consumed over a relatively
short period of processing time. An example is deboning, where the cumula­
tive cost rises sharply.




A focus on the long, horizontal sections of the CTP graph may help reduce
cumulative time (see Chapter 5). A focus on steep, vertical lines may help reduce
cumulative cost. The CTP can be used to prioritise improvement processes, as
shown by the cost-time grid in Figure 3.11 for a herb and spice manufacturer,
which was developed as part of a Cranfield study (SUCCESS project at Cranfield
School of Management, 2003).

Figure 3.11

Cost-time grid

(Source: Adapted from SUCCESS Handbook, 2003)

Processes in the top right-hand box are prime candidates for savings in both
time and cost. Processes in the bottom left-hand box are low on the list of
priorities.
A further Cranfield study, this time of a food sector FMCG in the confectionery
business, concluded that decisions to optimise cost in one area could have a
detrimental effect downstream (Whicker et al., 2009). Large batch sizes reduced
the need for machine changeovers in manufacturing. But this m eant that the
national distribution centre was often supplied with excess stock, and the resulting
inventory overspill had to be extracted and sent to third-party warehouses.
Savings in manufacturing efficiency were causing extra costs and lead times in
distribution.

3.5.2 Cost-to-serve (CTS)
So far, we have focused on manufacturing costs, but what about the cost of dis­
tributing products to customers? 'Putting the end-customer first' (Chapter 2) in­
cludes both the need to understand what aspects of service a particular customer
values and the need to serve customers in different ways. Cost-to-serve (CTS) is
defined (Guerreiro et al., 2008) as:
the cost o f the adm inistrative, com m ercial and logistics activities related to cus­
tom er service delivery, as measured through ABC m ethodology.


Identical manufactured products may be distributed in many different ways,
each of which affects CTS. Examples of factors that may influence CTS are:
• Distribution channel used (for example, wholesalers, supermarkets, hypermar­
kets - see Case study 2.2).
• Delivery frequency (for routinely planned replenishment deliveries - daily,
weekly, etc.).
• Customised deliveries (requiring special planning).
• Promotional activity (for example promotions, especially those associated with
seasonal events, such as Valentine's Day, require additional display aids to be
distributed to retail customers and the associated seasonal products are sub­
jected to high, yet unpredictable, demand).
• Contractual terms used (for example, pricing by full truck loads, full pallet
loads, pallet layers).
Recognising and allocating these costs to specific products and customers
means rebalancing total costs better to reflect the actual CTS (Braithwaite and
Samakh, 1998). Thus a CTS analysis enables a focal firm to assess the profitably
of serving individual customer accounts, and distribution channels, with current
supply chain design and customer service systems.
Results of rebalancing total costs on customer profitability - made on the
basis of profit margin after CTS - can be astonishing, as shown by Figure 3.12.
In place of the traditional Pareto curve, a 'whale curve' may result, where profits
are generated by 50 per cent of the customer base, and the other 50 per cent of
customers are currently unprofitable. Further, a shocking 80 per cent of the final

Figure 3.12

Customer profitability curve

(Source: After Guerreiro et al., 2008)




cumulative margin (shown as 100 per cent on the chart) comes from only 6 per
cent of customers (Cooper and Kaplan, 1988; Guerreiro et al., 2008).
This reveals a large proportion of loss-making customers for this Brazilian food
business. Axing the loss-making customers needs to be undertaken with great
care, because 'a significant proportion of service activity costs are fixed costs'
(Guerreiro et al., 2008). Such action would remove the contribution that these
customers provide, thus reducing the profit margins of the remaining customers.
Rather, knowledge of the causes of higher and lower margins and of relatively
high CTS costs for certain customers has implications including:
• service terms and conditions for unprofitable accounts need to be changed,
and converted into profitable alternatives;
• if this is not possible, prices should be increased for unprofitable customers,
or they should be removed gradually from the focal firm's sales portfolio
altogether;
• the most valuable customers may need more attention, by focusing more
customer service efforts on these customers. After all, it would be profitable to
grow sales with these customers.
Most importantly, CTS enables focal firms to link supply chain efforts to cus­
tomer value and market opportunity in a way that improves customer relations
and revenues in a profitable manner. CTS shows that outbound logistics contrib­
ute significantly to profitability and it enables a firm to identify the most prof­
itable growth opportunities and, equally, where rationalisation of product mix
might be required, as shown in Case study 3.6.

Clorox supports growth by cutting SKUs
Companies w an t to grow, and one of their com m onest strategies is to create new prod­
ucts. These may increase revenues, b u t o f course they do n o t guarantee profits. In fact,
p roduct proliferation often reduces margins. One com pany we studied found th a t the
bo tto m 40 per cent of its products generated less than 3 per cent o f revenue, and the
b o tto m 25 per cent of its products were highly unprofitable.
Several years ago, Clorox, a $4 billion consumer products company, realised it needed
to address the problem of underperform ing products. A t the tim e, 30 per cent of the
company's stock keeping units (SKUs) were falling short o f sales volum e and p ro fit tar­
gets. Clorox responded by developing a form al process fo r evaluating SKU performance
and making decisions about w hich products to cut.
As part o f the annual business planning process, annual reduction goals are estab­
lished fo r underperform ing SKUs, as w ell as a 'g lid e p a th ' (specific goals by m o n th )
and specific actions fo r reaching the reduction goal. Specific actions may include
discontinuance, substitution or increasing distrib u tio n . A cross-functional SKU m an­
agem ent process team , sponsored by the chief finance officer (CFO) and led by the
dire cto r o f supply chain planning, meets m o n th ly to track progress, s p o tlig h t busi­
nesses th a t are off-target, discuss process im provem ents and resolve policy issues. The
team includes director- or VP-level representatives fro m sales, m arketing, finance and
p ro d u c t supply.


This team uses a 'dashboard' (selected key measures o f performance) to evaluate the
performance of SKUs against annual sales volum e and p ro fit goals (or hurdles). The
dashboard also rates the performance of each business according to the p roportion of
SKUs th a t meet hurdles. Businesses are graded green if they are exceeding goals, yellow
if they are w ith in 5 per cent of target and red if they are more than 5 per cent below tar­
get. 'Red' businesses are required to specify tactics to bring their proportion of products
m eeting hurdle rates in line w ith goals. The executive teams of 'red' businesses typically
must identify underperform ing SKUs th a t w ill be eliminated, and specify the strategy
fo r elim inating them .
Like any business tactic, product rationalisation must be used cautiously. Many com ­
panies have tried to tackle this issue by ruthlessly cu ttin g the product portfolio. The
risk, though, is th a t a com pany cuts too deeply into its revenue streams and finds it
has discontinued products th a t key customers care for, dam aging im p o rta n t customer
relationships. Clorox frequently reviews product lines w ith customers to optimise the
p roduct m ix on the shelf.
Today, more than 90 per cent of Clorox's SKUs meet volum e and p ro fit hurdles, up
from 70 per cent fo u r years ago. Retail sales per SKU have grow n by more than 25 per
cent, the return on products has increased and retail customer service levels have im ­
proved. Clorox now leads its peers in retail sales per SKU in the m ajority o f its categories.

Q uestions

1 W hat reasons fo r and against product proliferations m ig h t different functions use?
2 W hat issues need to be considered when determ ining w hich SKUs to discontinue?

An understanding of activity-based costing approaches and return on capital
employed (Section 3.2) is necessary before addressing the im portant subject of
capital investment decisions. This is critical to a company's long-term financial
performance and is addressed in the next section.

3.6 How can capital investment decisions be made?
Key issue: How can capital investment decisions be made by taking into account

the subsequent cash flows, which dictate future liquidity of the company?

Supply chains typically require high capital investment in fixed assets, now
known as non-current assets, such as manufacturing facilities and equipment,
distribution centres and vehicle fleets. These non-current assets are distinct from
current assets in that they are 'tangible or intangible assets, acquired for retention
by an entity [such as a company] for the purpose of providing a service to the en­
tity and not held for resale in the normal course of trading' (Chartered Institute of
Management Accountants, 2005). In other words, unlike current assets, they are
retained by the company and are not sold. Typically, companies aim to minimise
investment in non-current assets (possibly by outsourcing non-core activities) as
a way to improve ROCE (as discussed in Section 3.2). Yet the key point is making




the right investment decisions that ensure that non-current assets generate good
rates of returns to the company and improve its profitability. In the words of
Hussey (1989, p. 196):
W hen m anagem ent is considering the in vestm en t o f a large sum o f m on ey over a
num ber o f years, the fundam ental objective is to ensure that the total m onies re­
ceived over tim e are higher than the am oun t o f the original investm ent.

Moreover, as a supply chain manager it is important to be able to influence
the board of directors' investment decisions using investment appraisal m eth­
ods, which show the likely impact on profitability and liquidity of the company.
Typically, there are three factors that need to be considered when conducting an
investment appraisal (Lucey 1990, 302):
• the investor's beliefs about the future;
• the alternatives available in which to invest;
• the investor's attitude to risk.

3.6.1

Four investment appraisal approaches
There are a number of investment appraisal approaches and four key approaches
are listed in Table 3.10. They are all focused on profitability, except for payback
period, which is concerned with liquidity (or cash flow). Also, it is important to
understand that, whilst the first two approaches (cost benefit analysis and pay­
back period) do not take into account the 'time value' of money, the latter two

approaches do, using the idea of 'discounted cash flows', which we will address in
the next subsection. This is an im portant concept because we all know that cash
can earn interest in the bank, which is not possible if it is invested in fixed assets.
A definition of each approach quoted from the Chartered Institute of Manage­
m ent Accountancy (CIMA, 2005) is provided in Table 3.10 and an illustration of
their application to a supply chain investment appraisal is in Case study 3.7. The
cost benefit analysis is often the initial assessment of an investment and simply
involves collecting all the costs of a proposed investment and comparing them to
all the benefits (in terms of cash inflows or savings) and, if the benefits are greater
than the costs, it is considered to be a good investment.
The payback period measures the time it takes for a proposed investment to gen­
erate cash that equates to the original cost, and the proposal with the shortest pay­
back period is normally the one that is accepted. This approach is concerned with
liquidity (cash flows) and minimising risk, rather than profitability because, after the
payback period, the cash flows (and their timing) are not taken into consideration.

3.6.2 W hat are discounted cash flows?
As mentioned earlier, both net present value (NPV) and internal rate of return
(IRR) take into account the time value of money by using discounted cash flows.
According to Hussey (1989, p. 199) 'this is done by converting future cash flows
from the project into equivalent values as at the present time, usually by using dis­
count tables'. This is taking into account the so-called 'opportunity cost', which is
the lost cash inflow, that could have been gained from simply investing the capi­
tal in a bank and generating interest of say 5 per cent, as illustrated in Figure 3.13.
According to Drury (2004, p. 496), 'a firm should invest in capital projects only if
they yield a return in excess of the opportunity cost of the investment', in other
words, if they generate a greater return than simply putting the cash in a bank.

Figure 3.13

Net present value (NPV) is 'a m ethod of evaluating capital projects by selecting
a discount rate to express future cash flows in present-day monetary terms'
(Hussey, 1989, p. 209). The discount rate is the rate of interest you could be ex­
pected to earn if you did not invest in the project and is called the 'test discount
rate' because it tests if this is a good investment. There are three main factors that
affect the discount rate (Atrill and McLaney, 2012):
• interest forgone: the interest the capital won't earn from, say being deposited in
a bank;
• risk premium: some investments are higher risk than others. For instance, in­
vesting in manufacturing equipm ent to produce a new range of products,
where the demand is highly uncertain, is a greater risk than the case where the
products produced are mature with far more accurate sales forecasts. Where
the risk is higher, a higher rate of return would be expected to compensate for
the increased risk of not getting the expected returns;
• inflation: due to inflation in a given country, m oney devalues each year. How­
ever, if both the capital investment (cash outflow) and the returns (cash in­
flow) are subject to the same rate of inflation, this can be ignored.
Present value curves are available that apply discount rates, in a compound
fashion (year on year), examples of which are shown in Figure 3.14. The present
value curves for 10 per cent, 30 per cent and 50 per cent discount rates show that,
the longer the period of the investment, and/or the higher the discount rate, the
lower the present value.
Using the present value curves in Figure 3.14 we can determine how much
£1,000 is worth in five years' time by drawing a vertical line up from five years
and reading off the present value, which gives a discount factor. We have done
this for 10 per cent and 30 per cent in Table 3.11.

discount rates

To calculate net present value, both the initial cash outflow for the investment,
and the subsequent cash inflows of the returns, must be at present value to enable
the calculation of the net present value of cash flows over the life of the asset, as
shown in Case study 3.7.
There are three outcomes for net present value (Francis, 1986, p. 302):
• If the NPV is positive it should be accepted.
• If it is zero the investment breaks even.
• If the NPV is negative then the investment should be rejected.
However, where the risk level is difficult to judge, as in Case study 3.7, then
it is useful to determine at what discount rate the NPV is zero and therefore the
investment is break-even. This is exactly what the internal rate of return (IRR) is,
according to Atrill and McLaney (2012, p. 368):
The IRR o f a particular investm en t is the discount rate that, w h en applied to its
future cash flow s, w ill produce a NPV of zero. In essence, it represents the yield from
an in vestm en t opportunity.

Calculating the IRR can take trial and error, trying different discount rates until
you get close to zero NPV. Alternatively, the following formula can be used:

Where i1 and i2 are the two discount rates associated with the corresponding
NPVs npv1 and npv2.
We will now consider a fictitious case where all four investment appraisal
approaches are used, so the strengths and weakness of each approach can be
appreciated.

The cost benefit analysis shows th a t the total cash benefit is £14,500, so it w ould appear
to be a good investment.

Payback period
The cum ulative cash flows shown in Table 3.12 demonstrate th a t after three years the
initial capital investm ent has been paid back by the cash savings each year.

N e t present value
First OTIF pic needs to determ ine the discount rate appropriate fo r the £25,000 invest­
m ent in the routing and scheduling system. Inflation was ignored because the same rate
applied to both the investm ent and the returns, so the inflation effect is cancelled out.
The company's cost o f capital (equivalent to the bank rate) was 10 per cent, therefore
it was decided to try discount rates of both 10 per cent and 20 per cent. These are ap­
plied to the cash flows fo r the system investm ent to give the net present values shown
in Table 3.1 3.

The discount rate of 10 per cent gives a positive NPV of £5,252, w hilst the 20 per cent
discount rate produces a negative NPV of £920. The question arises at w ha t discount


rate the NPV zero is and therefore when the investm ent is break-even. The internal rate
o f return is the answer.

Internal rate of return (IRR)
The IRR can be approxim ated by p lo ttin g the graph shown in Figure 3.15.

Figure 3.15

Graphical approach to calculating IRR for the OTIF investment

However, this graph assumes a linear relationship between discount rate and NPV,
w hich isn't the case, hence this gives only an approxim ate IRR. To calculate the IRR, the
form ula previously stated can be used:

IRR = 10 + [10* (5,252 / (5,252 - -920))
= 18.51%
Note: Two minuses make a plus

This produces a similar result to the graphical approach.

Sum m ary of results
The results from the fo u r investment appraisal approaches, see Table 3.14, suggest th a t
the proposed investment in a routeing and scheduling system is a good investment.

3.7 A balanced measurement portfolio
Key issues: How can a balanced set of measures of performance be developed in
order to address stakeholder satisfaction and stakeholder contribution? How can
process thinking be applied to measures across the supply chain using the supply

chain operations reference model?

Many organisations have suffered from undue emphasis on particular measures
of performance within the firm. For example, a preoccupation with labour pro­
ductivity may lead to excessive stocks of inbound parts ('do not run out of raw
materials otherwise bonuses will suffer'). Such a preoccupation may also lead to
excessive stocks of outbound products, because the most important priority is to
keep workers busy, whether the product can be sold or not. Whilst this priority
may be good for productivity, it may well disrupt flow in the supply network:
inbound parts are ordered too early, and outbound products are made too early.
W hat is good for one measure (productivity in this case) is bad for others (inven­
tories and material flow).
In reality, management today is faced with the challenge of performing across a
whole range of objectives. Different groups of stakeholders in a firm include share­
holders, employees, customers, suppliers, the local comm unity and government.
This is not a comprehensive list, and industries such as pharmaceuticals have
other im portant stakeholders, including regulators, such as the Drug Enforcement
Agency. The challenge for the directors of a firm is to balance the diverse interests
of these groups of stakeholders. We review the interests of each group in turn:
• Shareholders typically have a passing interest in a firm in which they invest.
They will keep their shareholding as long as it provides a return that is com­
petitive with other investments. Shareholders are impressed by high dividends
and share appreciation resulting from profitability and growth of the business.
Failure to deliver adequate returns often turns shareholders against the m an­
agement of the day.
• Employees often have a long-term com m itm ent to a firm, and are concerned
with employment stability, competitive wages and job satisfaction. Failure to
deliver on such goals may create negative reactions, such as loss of motivation
and loyalty, difficulty in recruitment, and various forms of industrial action.


• Customers are, in theory, the most im portant stakeholders in a free market
economy. It is their demand that draws material through the supply network.
Customers can choose from whom they buy, and failure to keep them satisfied
creates the risk of loss of business.
• Suppliers are interested in such benefits as long-term business, involvement in
new product development and, of course, payment on time. Failure to meet
such benefits leads to sanctions such as disruption of supply and higher prices.
• Local community. Here, the interests are in the firm as a local employer, with a
reputation for civic responsibility and long-term commitment to the region as
an employer and as a ratepayer. Failure to deliver against such interests may lead
to environmental disputes and difficulty in obtaining planning permission.
• Government is interested in the firm as a contributor to employment and value
creation in the economy, and as a source of revenues. Failure to meet govern­
m ent laws, on the other hand, may lead to prosecution or even closure of the
business.
Thus the directors of a business are faced with the need to manage the poten­
tially conflicting interests of the stakeholders, keeping each within what Doyle
(1994) refers to as a tolerance zone. Each stakeholder has a limit beyond which the
risk of disruption to the business increases rapidly. An upper limit exists as well.
For example, a preoccupation with profits may please shareholders for the time
being, but may result in negatives from labour exploitation and low levels of in­
vestment. Whilst bumper profits appear in year one, these are rapidly eroded as
the negatives cut in during later years. In the end, the whole business suffers. And
customers can disrupt the business too: a preoccupation with customers at the
expense of everything else can lead to shrinking margins and loss of focus. The
challenge for the directors is to keep all stakeholders just satisfied, keeping each
within the tolerance zone.

3.7.1

Balanced measures
Whilst balance between stakeholders is one issue, another is the balance between
financial and operational measures of performance, and between history and the
future. Kaplan and Norton (1996) point to the shortcomings of traditional cost
accounting systems. Traditional systems are geared to the needs of the stock mar­
ket, and essentially are historical and financial in emphasis. Modern systems,
they argue, need to be balanced between financial and operations, and between
history and the future. A way of showing the relative emphasis between tradi­
tional measures and balanced measures is to show relative priorities by means of
circles, where larger circles imply a greater priority and num ber of measures in
use, as shown in Figure 3.16.
In developing a modern performance measurement system it is necessary to
take all of these factors into account, and to create a balanced performance mea­
surement system. That is the objective of the ‘balanced scorecard'.
In practice, Kaplan and Norton propose that the balanced scorecard should bal­
ance the financial perspective (goals for future performance and measures of past





Figure 3.16

Traditional and balanced priorities

performance) with similar goals and measures for the underlying drivers of long­
term profitability. These drivers are identified as the business process perspective,
the innovation and learning perspective, and the customer perspective.

3.7.2 Supply chain management and the balanced scorecard
Extending the balanced scorecard into the context of the supply chain, Brewer
and Speh (2000) consider that performance measurement systems must be aligned
to supply chain practices:
If firms talk about the im portance o f supply chain concepts, but con tin u e to evalu­
ate em ployees using perform ance measures that are... unaffected by supply chain
im provem ents, then they w ill fail in their supply chain endeavours.

Traditional performance measurements within a focal firm have a num ber of
significant deficiencies. They track individual activities often within functions:
this can promote the optimisation of the function rather than of the supply net­
work as a whole.
As a general rule, effective cross-supply chain measures should have the follow­
ing characteristics (Derocher and Kilpatrick, 2000):
• be simple to understand;
• total no more than 10;
• be representative of a significant causal relationship;
• have an associated target;
• be capable of being shared across the supply chain.
The following are eight such measures, which can be adapted to focus on spe­
cific sectors:
• on time in full, outbound: a measure of customer orders fulfilled, complete and
on time, conforming to specification;


• on time in full, inbound: a measure of supplier deliveries received, complete and
on time, conforming to specification;
• internal defect rates: a measure of process conformance and control (rather than
inspection);
• new product introduction rate: a measure of supply chain responsiveness to new
product introduction;
• cost reduction: a measure of sustainable product and process improvement;
• stock turns: a measure of supply chain goods flow. This measure is useful when
applied to supply chains focused on segments: as a 'blanket' measure, it can be
misleading;
• order to delivery lead time: a measure of supply chain process responsiveness;
• financial flexibility: a measure of how easy it is to structure the supply chain for
financial advantage (with international supply chains, channelling operations
through low-tax locations for purposes of gaining supply chain cost benefits
should be considered).
The main benefits of these measures are that they can be applied to all partners
in a supply chain, and thereby can help to improve visibility and control between
partners. Consistent with our view that different supply strategies are needed to
support different product needs in the marketplace, the aim should be to identify
consistent groups of measures that support specific supply strategies.
Just as im portant is the need to coordinate measures to improve visibility and
control within a focal firm. The challenge is especially tough when there are many
operating units in a large, decentralised organisation. Tesco provides an example
of the communication needed by means of its 'corporate store steering wheel'
(shown in Figure 3.17). Case study 1.1 describes the sheer scale of the Tesco opera­
tion - m anned by some 400,000 employees in many countries. How do you keep
so many people in such a large organisation 'facing the same direction' - that is,
pursuing corporate strategy consistently? Tesco's answer has been to focus on 20
measures within 5 key areas - customer, finance, people, operations and comm u­
nity (Tesco, 2010).
Throughout all our businesses across the w orld w e m easure our perform ance
through the Steering W heel, w hether w e work in distribution, head office or in
stores. This helps m aintain focus and balance in w hat counts to run each o f our
businesses successfully, be it w age costs or w heth er customers can get everything
they want.

For example, each store receives a m onthly update of its performance against
each of the measures. 'Shopping lists' are selected extracts from Steering Wheel
measures, which direct individual groups of employees in their everyday jobs.

3.7.3 Supply chain operations reference model (SCOR)
The previous two sections looked at process-based performance measures within
an organisation. This section reviews a model that places a focal firm in the con­
text of the supply chain. In order to help companies to understand their supply

chain performance and opportunities for improvement, a cross-industry frame­
work has been developed by the Supply Chain Council. You can visit the Council
website at http://www.supply-chain.org.
This section gives an introduction to SCOR based on publicly available m ate­
rial; in order to obtain detailed benchmarking data from the model, your organi­
sation would need to become a member. In common with ABC, the SCOR model
uses a process-based approach to the supply chain.
The supply chain operations reference model (SCOR) is founded on five dis­
tinct m anagement processes. The supply chain is viewed in terms of overlapping
managem ent processes - source, make, deliver and return - within an integrated
planning framework that encompasses all of the organisations in the chain, as
shown in Figure 3.18. It is a process-based version of Figure 1.1 in Chapter 1. The
managem ent processes of the 'focal firm' are seen as linked with corresponding



Figure 3.18

Five distinct management processes

(Source: After Supply Chain Council, www.supply-chain.org)

processes within supplier and customer organisations. The five distinct manage­
m ent processes can be described as follows:
• Plan: the tasks of planning demand and supply set within an overall planning
system that covers activities such as long-term capacity and resource planning.
• Source: the task of material acquisition, set within an overall sourcing system
that includes activities such as vendor certification and vendor contracting.
• Make: the task of production execution, set within an overall production sys­
tem that includes activities such as shop scheduling. Any added value activity
(e.g. material repackaging at a distribution centre; quality control at a produc­
tion line) falls under this process type as well.
• Deliver: the day-to-day tasks of managing demand, orders, warehouse and
transportation, and installation and commissioning. These tasks are set within
an overall delivery m anagement system that includes order rules and manage­
m ent of delivery quantities.
• Return: the return of non-conforming goods for replacement or rectification,
and the recycling of materials no longer needed by the customer.
There are three levels to the SCOR model:
• Level 1: a broad definition of the plan, source, make, deliver and return m an­
agement processes, which is used to set competitive objectives.
• Level 2: defines core process categories that are possible scenarios of a supply
chain (e.g. make to stock, make to order, engineer to order).
• Level 3: provides the process breakdown needed to describe each element that
comprises the level 2 categories. Detailed performance metrics are set at this
level.
Table 3.15 shows 10 metrics at level 1 in the SCOR model, and is taken from
the SCOR website (www.supply-chain.org). As with processes, the model's
hierarchical structure is repeated also for the metrics. This means that the SCOR
model provides a breakdown of level 2 and level 3 subcomponents of the level
1 performance metrics. The intention is that an individual company should not

attem pt to be 'best in class' in all areas. Rather, a given company should target
its strength in four to six selected areas to create differentiation in the market­
place. The company will also need to ensure that it stays competitive in the
other areas. Note that the customer-facing measures are what we referred to in
Section 3.4 as 'discretionary costs', whilst the internal-facing measures are 'engi­
neered costs'. By drilling down into levels 2 and 3 of the SCOR model, the aim
is to identify the cost drivers and so convert discretionary costs into engineered
costs: that is, to convert supply chain performance directly into revenue, cost
and margin. Also note that the internal-facing metrics encourage improvement
of ROCE (Section 3.2) by reducing costs and maximising asset turns. Participat­
ing companies in the Supply Chain Council may obtain benchmarking infor­
m ation on how their organisation's performance compares with others: see the
website given above.
In order to illustrate how such concepts could be applied in practice,
Table 3.16 shows actual performance against the SCOR level 1 metrics for a giv­
en company. It also shows how those metrics compared w ith the SCOR database
in terms of what was needed to achieve parity with the 'competitive popula­
tion', what was needed to gain advantage and what was needed to show superior
performance. Where is this supply chain positioned in terms of its competitive
performance?
Not very well, it seems! A ll of the level 1 metrics are below parity, with the
exception of order fulfilment lead times. External metrics, such as delivery per­
formance and perfect order fulfilment, are seriously adrift. Production flexibility
is way behind the competitive population, suggesting that the master schedule
is 'fixed' for too long a period - and no doubt there will be underlying causes
of that. Internal measures are not in good shape either, with a poor cost perfor­
mance and a seriously uncompetitive asset utilisation record. The model associ­
ates level 2 and 3 process elements to the various metrics, so that, once the worst
performing metrics have been identified, the user has an indication of what are
the processes to look after in order to reduce the gap.

Summary
W h a t is 'v a lu e ' in th e c o n te x t o f th e su p p ly ch a in ?

• The delivery of customer and shareholder value needs to be balanced. They
may each reinforce the other, but supply chain m anagement must understand
how it impacts these values.
• Return on capital employed (ROCE) is a widely used method for measuring
shareholder value. ROCE encourages logistics m anagement to control costs,
working capital and fixed (non-current) assets.




• Logistics increasingly is concerned w ith funds flow as well as m aterial flow
and inform ation flow (Chapter 1). Cash flow in term s of liquidity is im ­
portant to the survival of any com pany and supply chain m anagem ent
should seek to balance the objectives of profitability, liquidity and asset
utilisation.
• Traditional cost accounting is unhelpful in making logistics-related decisions
because it is insensitive to processes and cost drivers. Traditional cost account­
ing tends to understate profits on high-volume products and overstate profits
on low-volume/high-variety products.
H o w ca n logistics costs b e b e tte r represen ted a n d c a p ita l in v e s tm e n t decisions
be m ade?

• Logistics costs can be better described by using a variety of m ethods of allo­
cating costs to products. The purpose of such a variety of allocations is to gain
better inform ation about the cost base of logistics operations, and hence to
take better decisions. For example, direct product profitability (DPP) attempts
to allocate logistics costs more specifically to products by considering how
they use fixed resources. Activity-based costing (ABC) seeks to understand
what factors drive costs, and how costs are incurred by logistics processes
th at span the organisation - and the supply chain in general. It is, essentially,
a process-based view of costing, and again seeks to enhance the quality of
logistics decision making. Cost-to-serve (CTS) is an extension of ABC th in k ­
ing that seeks to identify how distribution and service costs vary between
customers.
• Supply chains typically require high capital investment in non-current (fixed)
assets, such as manufacturing facilities and equipment, distribution centres
and vehicle fleets. Typically, companies aim to minimise investment in noncurrent assets (possibly by outsourcing non-core activities) as a way to improve
ROCE, yet the key point is making the right investment decisions that ensure
that non-current assets generate good rates of returns to the company and
improve its profitability Approaches like net present value (NPV) allow the
calculation of profitability over time, taking into account returns on alterna­
tive investment opportunities.
• Alone, financial measures that are rooted in the past are insufficient for taking
logistics decisions in today's fast-moving environment. A balanced measure­
m ent portfolio is called for, one that takes into account the needs of different
stakeholders in a business. A balanced measurement portfolio is extended into
the supply chain by means of the supply chain operations reference model
(SCOR).

Discussion questions
1 Explain w ha t is m eant by the term value in a supply chain. How can value best be
measured in a supply chain context?
2 Discuss the ways in w hich a com pany m ig h t im prove its ROCE.


3 W hat are the challenges and trade-offs fo r supply chain m anagem ent in balancing
the objectives of profitability, liquidity and asset utilisation?
4 W hy are processes im p o rta n t in terms of m anaging logistics? Suggest how the pro­
cesses of plan, source, make, deliver and return m ig h t differ in the case of the tw o
factories Simple and Complex, described in Section 3.5.
5 W hat are the advantages o f cutting the 'total cost cube' in different ways? Summarise
the different perspectives on logistics costs provided by fixed/variable, direct/indirect
and engineered/discretionary costs, and by activity-based costing.
6 Suggest balanced measurement portfolios fo r the tw o factories Simple and Complex,
described in Section 3.5. In particular, suggest key performance measures in the areas
of strategy, process and capability.

LEVERAGING LOGISTICS
OPERATIONS
Part Two uses the foundation of logistics m anagem ent and strategy developed in Part
One to concentrate on key tasks fo r logistics operations. This covers the centre panel
of our logistics model: the flo w of materials, lead times and the network of operations
in a global context.
Despite its role in corporate success, the logistics task ultim ately boils dow n to
orchestrating the flo w of materials and inform ation in the supply chain. The aim is to
support products and services in the marketplace better than com petitors. You could
say th a t the logistics task is about making strategic objectives a reality by executing
against demand and making value propositions to customers a reality. Logistics
delivers value. Increasingly, this means im proving sustainability, reducing operational
risks in the international pipeline and considering a focal firm 's social responsibilities
in an international context.
Chapters 4 and 5 look at the basic dimensions of logistics operations: their inter­
national reach and their contribution to a tim ely response to dem and. Chapters 6
and 7 then take th a t thinking a level higher by introducing key managerial concepts
th a t support logistics operations. Chapter 6 addresses the immense am ount of detail
th a t is needed to plan and control material flo w - both in the focal firm and more
broadly in the supply chain. Chapter 7 reviews the role of lean thinking in reducing
waste in the supply chain, and in im proving coordination of material movements.
We also review the role of agility in elevating the speed of response to uncertain endcustomer demand.






CHAPTER 4

Managing logistics internationally

Objectives

The intended objectives o f this chapter are to:

•

identify challenges that internationalisation presents to logistics
management;

•

analyse the structure and managem ent of a global logistics network.

By the end o f this chapter you should be able to:

•

understand the forces that are shaping international logistics;

•

understand challenges of international logistics networks;

•

understand how to begin to balance these in organising for international
logistics - bearing in mind risks, governance and sustainability
considerations.

Introduction
The early roots of logistics are in international transport, which was a central
element of many fundamental models in economic theory. In traditional location
theory, for example, transport costs were optimised in relation to distance to market
and production locations. The origins of internationalisation can be traced back to
the expanding trade routes of early civilisations. Discoveries made in excavations
from Europe, Asia, Africa and the Americas reveal artefacts made hundreds or
even thousands of miles away from the site, at the edges of their respective known
worlds. Developments in transport, navigation and communication progressively
have expanded our horizons. Measured in transport time and costs, the world
has shrunk to the dimensions of a 'global village'. Many take for granted the
availability of products from around the world and safe, fast inter-continental
travel on container carriers and aircraft. It is in this context that a clear link exists
between logistics and economic development. The connectivity of all regions of
the world is essential for international trade. As a result, many projects aimed at
supporting regional economic development focus on the infrastructure needed to
support integration into the global economy.
The logistics dimension of internationalisation conjures up a vision of parts flow­
ing seamlessly from suppliers to customers located anywhere in the world, and a
supply network that truly spans the entire globe. Often, basic products such as deep­
freeze pizzas combine a multitude of locations from which ingredients are sourced,




and an international transport network that links production locations to ware­
houses and multiple stores. The enormous geographical span of this logistics system
cannot be recognised in the price of the product. This can be explained by transport
having become just a commodity in the global village. At the micro level of the
individual company, however, the reality is that there are few examples of truly
global supply chains. There are many barriers to such a vision. For example, local
autonomy, local standards and local operating procedures make the integration of
information flow and material flow a challenging task. Local languages and brand
names increase product complexity. Global supply chains are made more compli­
cated by uncertainty and difficulty of control. Uncertainty arises from longer lead
times and lack of knowledge over risks and local market conditions. Coordination
becomes more complex because of additional language and currency transactions,
more stages in the distribution process, and local government intervention through
customs and trade barriers. But there are many instances where a truly globalised
logistics system is not necessary, and where 'internationalisation' is a more accurate
description. Internationalisation is an increasing feature of the majority of supply
chains. International sourcing of component parts and international markets for
finished goods are extending as world trade increases. The move of supply and
production to 'off-shore' locations has been steady and stable. However, this does
not mean that internationalisation is without risks. Challenges in migrating supply
to remote locations, breakdowns in product flow, environmental considerations
resulting from greater shipping distances and corporate social responsibility consid­
erations may need to be taken into account.
The factoring in of risks, environmental and social considerations into the design
of international logistics operations has made longstanding logistics formulas
more problematic to apply. And it has helped the mindset of logistics managers
to move beyond 'available everywhere at low cost' towards a more qualified
approach of 'available at a certain price and within a defined risk/reliability'.
W ithin the context of this changing global landscape for logistics, the overall
aim of this chapter is to analyse the internationalisation of logistics, and to
explore how to begin to organise international supply chains. Figure 4.1 shows
the framework for this chapter: drivers and enablers need to be countered by risk

factors in organising logistics internationally. Essentially, this means developing
and designing an international logistics network, managing risks and developing
international governance structures, whilst keeping social responsibility and
environmental concerns in mind.
This chapter addresses eight key issues:
1 Drivers and logistics implications of internationalisation: the trade-off facing
internationally operating businesses.
2 The tendency towards internationalisation: three strategies fo r im proving the
transition to global supply chains.
3 The challenges of international logistics and location: barriers to international
logistics.
4 Organising for international logistics: proposes principles by w hich international
logistics networks can be organised, including offshoring considerations.
5 M anaging for risk readiness: tw o levels of risk readiness and several specific steps
to take.
6 Reverse logistics: developing the 'returns' process.
7 Corporate social responsibility in the supply chain: the need to include social
responsibility in supply chain design.
8 Establishing global governance of the supply chain organisation: the need to
organise and manage teams across the geographical span of the supply chain: cen­
trally, decentrally, and anything in between.

4.1 Drivers and logistics implications of
internationalisation
Key issue: W hat are the trade-offs between responsiveness to local markets and
economies of scale?

The business approach towards internationalisation is not taking place according
to any common pattern. In assessing the nature of cross-border logistics, three
questions can be asked:
• Does internationalisation imply a universal global approach to supply chain
management?
• Does internationalisation require a 'global' presence in every market?
• Does internationalisation distinguish between the companies that globally
transfer knowledge and those that do not?
The arguments presented in this section suggest that the answer to each of these
questions is 'no'.
The 'single business' concept of structuring the supply chain in the form of uniform
approaches in each country is losing ground. 'McColonisation' was effectively
abolished when McDonald's announced localisation of its business in such areas
as marketing and local relations. In response to local crises in quality, and suffering




from local competition, the corporate headquarters were downsized to help empower
the local organisation. (This also means localising the focal firm's hum an resource
practices, a point we return to in Chapter 8.) The same applied to the Coca-Cola
Company, which abandoned 'CocaColonisation' - based on a universal product,
marketing, and production and distribution model - for the same reasons. In favour
of local brands and product varieties, Procter & Gamble is doing the same. In supply
chains we find regional variations in the application of international principles.
This does not mean to say that localisation is the new mainstay. Unilever, a
traditionally localised competitor of Procter & Gamble, has announced a de­
crease in the number of brands, and has rationalised operations away from strict
localisation over the past decade, and probably will continue to do so for a while.
Somewhere between local and global extremes, Procter & Gamble and Unilever
will meet each other in a new competitive area.
Looking at the different drivers of internationalisation, four basic global shifts
in international investm ent and trade can be identified across the past several
decades, with a possible fifth coming to the forefront in m odern markets, as
listed in Table 4.1. Such shifts, of course, have an impact on international trade
and the flow of goods. In particular, destinations change as well as logistics

requirem ents. The 'fourth generation' recognised the logistics trade-off between
responsiveness to local markets, environm ental and risk concerns w ith the
benefits of internationalisation. The fifth shift, only just beginning to emerge,
refocuses attention towards keeping the global supply chain coordinated
and effectively governed, despite the dispersed nature of teams and markets.
And the focus is on coordinating for integrated effectiveness, whilst enabling
diverse and dynamic resource allocation, to shift w ith risks, new markets and
to shift towards pockets of talent and capabilities, wherever they may be.
At a company level, generic drivers of internationalisation include:
• a search for low factor and supply costs (land, labour, materials);
• the need to follow customers internationally in order to be able to supply locally
and fast;
• a search for new geographical market areas;
• a search for new learning opportunities and exposure to knowledge (such
as locating in Silicon Valley - a 'hot spot' in development of international
electronics, software and internet industries).
The importance of these drivers varies by com pany and with time.
Considering the sequence of global shifts, proximity to production factors such
as labour and low material costs can be considered more basic th an market- or
even knowledge-related drivers. Furthermore, the importance of the respective
drivers is dependent upon the internationalisation strategy of the company
involved. Table 4.2 provides examples of strategic contexts and - in the bottom

row - the logistics implications of those strategies. The multi-domestic and
global strategies represent two extremes, whilst the integrated network strategy
represents a balance between them. The consequences of this 'balancing act' for
logistics are analysed below. Case study 4.1, about Airbus, offers illustrations of
how complex and comprehensive supply chain m anagem ent in an international
context can be and how hard it can be to manage against risks for service and
value.

CASE STUDY

4.1

Launching a new aeroplane at Airbus and Boeing
When Airbus introduced its Airbus A380 double decker superplane in January 2005 to
the press and the world it was an impressive show that brought out government leaders
and made headlines all over the world. A little while later, however, delays to the actual
delivery of the first planes were announced. The causes for this were found largely in the
international supply chain and its design.
In October 2006, the then Airbus president and CEO Christian Streiff said: 'This is
a very long and complex value chain. Whilst everyone on board was on top of their
job, the production process... not the aeroplane... has one, big flaw - one weak link
in the chain: that of the design of the electrical harnesses installation in the forward
and aft fuselage. To be clear: this is the weak link in the manufacturing chain, this is
the reason why ramping up the production is hampered. But the electrical harnesses
are not the root causes why we at Airbus are in a crisis. The issue of the electrical
harnesses is extremely complex, w ith 530 km of cables, 100,000 wires, and 40,300
connectors.'
This quote clearly points to the supply chain and design as the cause for delays. In
addition to the wiring issues there were some further supplier-related challenges as well.
A lot of different locations are an inherent aspect of the supply chain, not least because
customers and sponsoring countries require a share of the production process to be
located in their countries. So many locations, and design and make tasks, are involved.
This created a lot of challenges that needed detailed coordination. For example, one
small component was supposed to be built in a plant in Italy for which a location was
selected, but no permit had been granted by local authorities. It turned out that there
were some very old olive trees on this site that had protected status. This is just one
example of how local considerations can be specific and detailed, hard to predict yet
potentially having a big impact on the supply chain. Additionally, a Japanese supplier
of seats was said to have caused further delivery delays. A complex project such as
developing and building a new plane across multiple countries and locations can be
very challenging in terms of scale and scope.
When Airbus launched the A380, the early signs of supply chain shortfalls already
existed, but they were well hidden. Under the paint, screws were missing. Behind the
panels, lots of parts were missing. The launch was a great spectacle, but you cannot
hide a supply chain that is not working behind some paint for long...
(Source: Quote from: http://blog.seattlepi.com/aerospace/archives/107302.asp)


Around the same time that Airbus launched the A380, its largest competitor, Boeing, was
bringing the Dreamliner to the market: a product directly competing in the same market
segment and suffering very similar supply chain challenges. In addition to the launch
being impacted by shortages of parts, after its introduction in the market, there were
submodules and parts failures, causing a large-scale grounding of planes in late 2012,
early 2013. In addition to that, sourcing and coordination were seen as overly complex,
grinding the whole product to a hard landing.

be more difficult than locating it on a single site and location.

4.1.1

Logistical implications of internationalisation
Internationalising logistics networks holds consequences for inventory, handling
and transport policies.

Inventory

Centralising inventories across multiple countries can hold advantages in terms
of inventory-holding costs and inventory levels that are especially relevant for
high-value products. On the other hand, internationalisation may lead to prod­
uct proliferation, due to the need for localisation of products and the need to
respond to specific local product/market opportunities.

Handling

Logistics service practices may differ across countries as well as regulation on stor­
age and transport. Adjusting handling practices accordingly is a prerequisite for
internationalisation. Furthermore, the opportunity to implement best practice
across various facilities may also be possible. Both of these practices assist the
process of internationalisation.

Transport

Owing to internationalisation, logistics pipelines are extended and have to cope
with differences in infrastructure across countries, whilst needing to realise delivery
within the time-to-market. This may drive localisation. On the other hand, the
opportunity for global consolidation may drive international centralisation.




Within this final, central, consideration in the globalise-localise dimension of
logistics, global businesses face a challenge that can be summarised in terms of a
simple trade-off between the benefits of being able to consolidate operations glob­
ally on the one hand, and the need to compete in a timely m anner on the other.

4.1.2 Time-to-market
Time-to-market has particular significance for the m anagement of the global
logistics pipeline. The subject of time is considered in depth in Chapter 5, although
we shall touch on the following issues here:
• product obsolescence;
• inventory-holding costs.

Product obsolescence

The extended lead time inherent in international logistics pipelines means that
products run the risk of becoming obsolete during their time in transit. This is
especially true for products in industries with rapid technological development,
such as personal computing and consumer electronics, and for fashion goods
such as clothing and footwear.
Inventory-holding costs

Lead time spent in the logistics pipeline increases the holding cost of inventory.
In addition to the time spent in physical transit, goods travelling internationally
will incur other delays. These occur at consolidation points in the process, such
as in warehouses where goods are stored until they can be consolidated into a
full load, such as a container. Delay frequently occurs at the point of entry into
a country whilst customs and excise procedures are followed. We review these is­
sues in more depth in Chapter 7.

4.1.3 Global consolidation
Global consolidation occurs as managers seek to make best use of their assets and
to secure lowest-cost resources. This approach leads to assets such as facilities
and capital equipment being used to full capacity, so that economies of scale
are maximised. Resources are sourced on a global scale to minimise cost by
maximising purchasing leverage and to pursue economies of scale. The types of
resource acquired in this way include all inputs to the end-product, such as raw
materials and components, and also labour and knowledge. Familiar features of
global consolidation include:
• sourcing of commodity items from low-wage economies;
• concentration at specific sites;
• bulk transportation.


Sourcing commodity items from low -w age economies

Two sourcing issues are used by internationally operating organisations:
• consolidation of purchasing of all company divisions and companies;
• sourcing in low-wage economies.
Internationally operating organisations seek to consolidate the purchas­
ing made by all their separate divisions and operating companies. This allows
them to place large orders for the whole group, which enables them to m ini­
mise costs by using their bargaining power and by seeking economies of scale.
At its extreme, a com pany may source all of its requirem ents for its range of
a given commodity, such as a raw material or a com ponent, from a single
source.
Internationally operating companies are on a constant quest to find new, cheaper
sources of labour and materials. This trend led to the move of manufacturing
from developed industrial regions to lower-cost economies. Examples of this are:
• Western Europe to Eastern Europe;
• USA to Mexico;
• Japan to China, India and Vietnam.
These developing economies have seen impressive growth over recent years.
This has led to increased prosperity for their people and rising standards of living.
However, these advances in social standards raise the cost of labour and other
resources. Therefore, the relentless search for the lowest production cost has led
to some companies re-sourcing commodity items to lower-wage countries in Asia,
North Africa and South America.
In some cases this movement of facilities around the globe has come full circle,
with Asian companies setting up plants in the UK, not only to gain access to the
EU market but also to take advantage of lower overall costs.

CASE STUDY

4.2

Airmiles for food and flowers
The subject of air miles appears regularly in media headlines today. Here are two contrasting
views o f w hat is happening.

Supermarkets and food producers are taking their products on huge journeys, despite
pledging to cut their carbon emissions. Home-grown products are being transported
thousands of miles for processing before being put on sale back in Britain. Jason
Torrance, campaigns director of Transport 2000, the environmental transport group,
said, 'We are producing food in one corner of the world, packing it in another and then
shipping it somewhere else. It's mad.'
Dawnfresh, a Scottish seafood company that supplies supermarkets and other large
retailers, cut 70 jobs after deciding to ship its scampi more than 8,000km to China
to be shelled by hand, then shipped back to Scotland and breaded for sale in
Britain. The company said it was forced to make the move by commercial pressures.




This seems a bizarre thing to do but the reality is that the numbers don't stack up any
other way,' says Andrew Stapley, a director. 'We are not the first in the industry that has
had to do this. Sadly, it's cheaper to process overseas than in the UK, and companies like
us are having to do this to remain competitive.'
(Source: Jon Ungoed-Thomas, Sunday Times, 20 May 2007)

Commissioned by World Flowers, a study was carried out by Adrian Williams of Cranfield University's Natural Resources Department to establish the actions needed to
reduce Sainsbury's [a retailer] carbon footprint regarding Kenyan roses. Results have
provided a fresh challenge to much current thinking on local sourcing and the impact
of air freight. The high environmental cost of heating and lighting for growing roses
in the Netherlands outweighed emissions caused by flying them in from Kenya, with
its naturally warm all-year temperatures. It also indicated that carbon dioxide (C 0 2)
emissions from Kenyan roses were just 17 per cent of Dutch roses, including the larger
impact of C 0 2 emissions to high altitude by air freighting. The study found that 6kg of
CO2 was produced per dozen Kenyan roses, as opposed to 35kg for production in the
Netherlands. Whereas 99 per cent of the Dutch emissions were caused by producing
the roses, only 7 per cent of the emissions from the Kenyan flowers were accounted for
by growing them there. In contrast, nearly 99 per cent of the CO2 emissions from the
Kenyan roses were accounted for by the 6,000 km clocked up by air freighting them
to the UK.

Questions

1 What are the pros and cons of sourcing commodity items in low-wage economies?
2 Consider the 2013 horsemeat scandal and what risk factors are introduced with far
and remote sourcing.

Concentration a t specific sites

Consolidation of purchasing applies not only to commodity goods but also to
high-value or scarce resources. Research and development skills are both high
value and scarce. Therefore there is an incentive to locate at certain sites to tap
into specific pools of such skills. Examples of this are 'Silicon Valley' in Califor­
nia and 'Silicon Fen' near Cambridge as centres of excellence in IT. Companies
originally located in these areas to benefit from research undertaken in the nearby
universities.
Companies become more influential in directing such research and benefiting
from it if they have a significant presence in these locations. This is helped if
global research is consolidated onto a single site. Whilst this may m ean missing
out on other sources of talent, consolidated R&D gives a company a presence
that helps to attract the bright young minds that will make their mark in these
industries in the future, and it allows synergies to develop between research
teams.


Activity 4.1
An international logistics pipeline is represented in Figure 4.2 as a set of logistics processes that
are connected together like sections of a pipe. However, the sections may be in different coun­
tries - requiring planning and coordination of the processes on a global scale. The interna­
tional pipeline therefore has a number of special characteristics, some of which are suggested
in Case study 4.2 on the previous page. Use Table 4.3 to make a list of the characteristics that
you believe make a global logistics pipeline different from one that operates only nationally.

Bulk transportation

One of the more obvious advantages of operating a company in a global manner
is the cost advantage of consolidated transportation. Taking Procter & Gamble
as an example, 350 ship containers, 9,000 rail car and 97,000 truck loads are
transported every day. The opportunity for cost saving by coordinating these
movements and maximising utilisation is significant.




4.2 The tendency towards internationalisation
Key issue. How can we picture the trade-offs between costs, inventories and lead
times in international logistics?

In order to remain competitive in the international business environment,
companies seek to lower their costs whilst enhancing the service they provide
to customers. Two commonly used approaches to improve the efficiency and
effectiveness of supply chains are focused factories and centralised inventories.

4.2.1

Focused factories: from geographical
to product segmentation
Many international companies, particularly in Europe, originally would have
organised their production nationally. In this situation, factories in each country
would have produced the full product range for supply to that country. Over
time, factories in each country might have been consolidated at a single site,
which was able to make all the products for the whole country. This situation, in
which there is a focus on a limited segment of the geographical market, is shown
in Figure 4.3 (a).
The focused factory strategy involves a company's consolidating production
of products in specific factories. Each 'focused factory' supplies its products
internationally to a wide market and focuses on a limited segment of the product
assortment. This situation is shown in Figure 4.3 (b).

Figure 4.3

(a) Focused markets: full-range manufacture for local markets
(b) Focused factories: limited range manufacturing for all markets


Traditional thinking is that this organisational strategy will deliver cost
advantages to a global company. Whilst this is true for production costs, the same
is not necessarily true for inventory-holding costs and transport costs.

A ctivity 4.2

Focused factories have an impact on the important trade-off between cost and delivery lead
time. Make a list of the advantages and disadvantages of focused factories. One example of each
has been entered in the table below to start you off.

Disadvantages

4.2.2 Centralised inventories
In the same way th at the consolidation of production can deliver cost benefits,
so can the consolidation of inventory. Rather than having a large num ber
of local distribution centres, bringing these together at a small num ber of
locations can save costs. Savings can be achieved in this way by coordinating
inventory m anagem ent across the supply pipeline. This allows duplication to
be eliminated and safety stocks to be minimised, thereby lowering logistics
costs and overall distribution cycle times. Both may sound contrary to the fact
that the transport pipeline will extend, owing to the longer distribution legs to
customers from the central warehouse in comparison with a local warehouse.
Nevertheless, through centralising inventory, major savings can be achieved by
lowering overall speculative inventories, very often coupled with the ability to
balance peaks in dem and across regional markets from one central inventory.
Figure 4.4 characterises the different operating environm ents where centralised
inventory may be a more or a less relevant consideration, based upon logistics
characteristics.
In product environments where inventory costs are more im portant than the
distribution costs, centralised inventories are a relevant concern. This is typically
the case for products of high value (measured in costs per volume unit). Micro­
chips are an extreme example: these products are of such high cost per volume
unit that distributing from the m oon could still be profitable! Distribution costs
have a marginal impact on logistics costs per product, assuming of course that
transport costs are mainly a function of volume and weight. Products that require
special transport, such as antiques, art, confidential documents or dangerous
chemicals, may represent a different operating environment.





Figure 4.4

Inventory centralisation against logistics costs and service dimensions

A second dimension that needs to be taken into consideration is that of
distribution lead times. Here, we focus on physical distribution from warehouse
to customer, and not on the inbound pipeline. Centralising inventory may
lead to lower factory-to-warehouse distribution costs because shipments can be
consolidated into full container loads. Where service windows to customers are
very compressed there may not be sufficient time to ship products from a central
warehouse and allow for the required transit time within the service window.
This is why, for example, hospitals and pharmacies retain inhouse stocks of
products, almost irrespective of their inventory costs. Critical medicines and
surgical appliances need to be available instantly and locally, regardless of
inventory costs.
In general, transport costs have continued to decline over time as a relative
cost item because of innovations in transport technology, the commoditisation
of transport (such as container ships), and the oversupply of transport capacity
for basic transport. These factors in themselves contribute to the increasing
internationalisation of logistics: physical distance becomes less important,
even for bulky products. However, the lead-time dimension loses some of
its relevance, from a transport point of view. Customer dem and can be very
volatile and unpredictable. Accuracy of delivery (the right quantity) therefore
can be a more demanding challenge than speed (the right time). Speed is
available through different transport modes (container ship, air cargo, express,
courier, for example) at reasonable prices. In very volatile markets, control over
international inventories by means of centralised inventories can be crucial.


Overall delivery reliability ('on time in full') tends to increase significantly, to
the benefit of an organisation's performance in terms of service requirements.
The ability to balance peaks across market regions from a central inventory is
amongst the additional advantages. Different levels of inventory centralisation
can be applied according to different dimensions. Taking the European market as
an example, the range is from local inventories (by country or even by location)
through international (a selection of countries) to the complete continent. Many
companies now include the Middle East and Africa as a trading bloc (Europe,
Middle East and Africa - EMEA).
Centralised inventory management and focused factories enable different de­
livery strategies to be combined. Figure 4.5 depicts a simple distribution network
that enables three different delivery strategies (listed in Table 4.4) to be applied as
appropriate. For example, an opportunity to think globally arises where the key
product relies more on the designer label and its promotion and marketing and
less on its manufacturing origins. The key to success in clothing is often about
fashionable design and labelling. Low labour costs (rather than material costs) of
production can then be achieved by outsourcing to low-wage economies, often
in the Far East.

Centralised distribution at Nike
'centralised and specialised, but not standardised'
Nike has a central customer service centre (distribution centre) located at Laakdal in
Belgium. The centre is 200,000 square metres in size and serves 45,000 customers
in EMEA w ith footwear, apparel and equipment. The centre receives products from
supplier factories around the world for distribution to retail clients both before the start
of all four seasons each year, and during a given season. Prior to the start of a season,
when work is at a peak, the workforce stands at some 2,300 operational staff. Off peak,
that drops to 1,350 staff. Deliveries are very time-critical, given the seasonal nature
of the business. Retailers demand in-store availability on day one of a new season.
The centre is a clear example of a company deciding to centralise receiving, storage
and shipment to customers at one location in Europe. The benefits include consoli­
dation of inbound shipments, lower inventory levels and better delivery service (in
comparison to fragmented warehouses scattered around Europe). This does not mean,
however, that the logistics operations are standardised for all flows of goods and all
customers.
Not every shipment is handled in a standard way through a single distribution pipeline:
•

•

•
•

About a quarter of the volume of shipments is shipped to customers directly. These
are larger shipments, such as full pallets for larger customers - for which there is no
need to consolidate with other shipments. As a result, it is cheaper and quicker to
make these shipments directly.
New growth areas that are served from the centre are Russia, Turkey and South
Africa. For Russia, the first satellite centre w ith small inventories was recently opened
to enable faster local replenishment of selected products.
Selected shipments to selected retailers are dealt with by a materials handling opera­
tion at the centre. This mainly involves labelling and re-packing operations.
Some retailers share weekly point of sale data with Nike, enabling it to replenish
inventories based upon actual sales.

Questions

1 What are the reasons for a company, such as Nike, w ith a centralised distribution
centre to ship some products directly to customers, not through the distribution
centre?
2 What are the reasons to start satellite centres when a company such as Nike has a
centralised distribution centre?
3 What are the pros and cons of locating materials handling operations, such as labelling
and packing, in a distribution centre, as opposed to in a factory?

4 What are the pros and cons for a company such as Nike to take on these materials
handling services as opposed to leaving them to retail customers?


4.3 The challenges of international logistics and location
Key issue: W hat are the risks in international logistics in terms of time and
inventories, and how can they be addressed?

International logistics is complex, and different from localised logistics pipelines.
The m ain differences that need to be taken into consideration are:
• extended lead time of supply;
• extended and unreliable transit times;
• multiple consolidation and break points;
• multiple freight modes and cost options;
• price and currency fluctuations.
Information technologies can help to circumvent these challenges in general,
and the proper location of international operations in particular can help to
resolve some of these challenges. Another key point is that the benefits of sourcing
from low-cost locations could be lost by the operating costs and challenges of
international logistics. Hence it is key to consider these prior to making decisions
about global sourcing and offshoring.

4.3.1

Extended lead time of supply
In an internationally organised business, most products produced in a particular
factory will be sold in a number of different countries. In order to manage the
interface between the production and sales teams in each territory, long lead
times may be quoted. This buffers the factory, allowing it to respond to the local
variations required in the different markets.

4.3.2 Extended and unreliable transit times
Owing to the length and increased uncertainty of international logistics pipe­
lines, both planned and unplanned inventories may be higher than optimal. A
comparison of the length of domestic and international product pipelines and
their associated inventories is shown in Figure 4.7, which uses a similar 'pipeline'
illustration to Activity 4.1. Variation in the time taken for international transport
inevitably will lead to increased holding of inventory with the aim of providing
safety cover.




Activity 4.3
A footwear company has a number of manufacturing facilities around Asia, as shown in Figure 4.6.
There are five manufacturing sites in China, three in India, and one each in Thailand, Singapore
and Taiwan. Singapore and Hong Kong also have the facility to act as regional consolidation sites.
Draw arrows on the map showing where the flow of exports to the North American market
could be consolidated. Write a brief description that explains your reasons for choosing these
consolidation points and the flows between them.

Figure 4.6

Location of Asian facilities

4.3.3 Multiple consolidation and break points
Consolidation is one of the key ways in which costs in pipelines can be lowered.
Economies of scale are achieved when goods produced in a num ber of different
facilities are batched together for transport to a common market.
The location of consolidation points depends on many factors that are not
really appropriate to consider in a simple assignment such as this. That said, the
following is one solution. Products manufactured in India should be consolidated
at the site on the east coast (near Madras) for shipping to Singapore. Here they
are combined with the output from the Thai and Singapore factories and shipped
to Hong Kong. Products are consolidated at a Chinese port, possibly Shanghai,
and transported by rail or sea to Hong Kong. All the other manufacturing sites
deliver direct to Hong Kong, where products from all the various facilities are
consolidated and shipped to Los Angeles.
It is worth noting that, after arrival in LA, this process runs in reverse. The
consignment will be broken down at various 'break points' throughout North
America and the goods distributed to market via hubs.

4.3.4 Multiple freight modes and cost options
Each leg of a journey between manufacture and the market will have a number of
freight mode options. These can be broken down in simplistic terms into air, sea,
rail and road. W ithin each of these categories lies a further range of alternative
options. Each of them can be assessed for their advantages and disadvantages
in terms of cost, availability and speed. W hen the journey along the supply
chain involves multiple modes, the interface between them provides further
complication. (See Activity 4.4.)

4.3.5 Price and currency fluctuations
W hen operating around the globe, fluctuations in currencies along the sup­
ply chain can have an impact on how the supply chain is configured. W hilst
it can take years to develop a global supply chain structure and operational




footprint, currencies fluctuate daily - and sometimes wildly. Such fluctuations
do not favour operations in countries with an unstable currency, and explain
why some countries and industries do most of their business in a single cur­
rency, even if not their own. For example, price fluctuations of fuel have im ­
pacted the feasibility of international shipping against the benefits of lower,
centralised inventories. Figure 4.8 shows that inventory holdings become less
cost justifiable as the costs of shipping increase. Essentially, global transport
is not free.

4.3.6 Location analysis
A structural com ponent of international logistics pipeline design is the location
design or, in other words, deciding where operations are going to be performed.
As Figure 4.9 shows, there is a sequence to the decision-making process involved
that incorporates the business (left-hand side) and geographical decision making
(right-hand side). Business decision making evolves from a strategic comm itm ent
through a decision support analysis project to implementation of the resulting
plan at a selected location. In parallel, the location analysis starts at the level of
relevant continent, through consideration of relevant countries and regions, to
the selection of a location.

4.4 Organising for international logistics
Key issue: How can supply chains be better organised to m eet the challenges of
international logistics?

There are at least three elements in organising for international logistics. These are:
• layering and tiering;
• the evolving role of individual plants;
• reconfiguration processes.
These will be outlined in the following subsections.

4.4.1

Layering and tiering
Internationalisation is looked at often from the point of view of asset centralisation
and localisation. However, the wider organisational setting needs to be taken into
account as well.


A commonly used maxim is g lo b a l coordination a n d local operation, which relates
to laying out the flow of information and coordination differently from the map
of the physical operations. For example, Hewlett-Packard (HP) operates a globally
consistent and coordinated structure of product finalisation and distribution in
contrast to its continental operations. The company runs a final manufacturing and
central distribution operation in Europe, the USA and Asia for each continent. The
operations are structured and run exactly the same, with the only difference being
the way that products are configured to suit end-customers in the specific regions.
This final configuration process (which in the case of HP may include fitting power
leads and local instructions) is referred to as p o stp o n em en t, which we review in more
detail in Chapter 6. Regional facilities are often owned and operated on a dedicated
basis by a contract manufacturer and th ird p a r ty logistics providers (3PL, reviewed
in Chapter 8). HP brings only limited management expertise to these regional
operations to assure global coordination. Thus, although HP operates in a globalised
way, its products are tuned to local markets by means of local logistics operations.
Therefore developments in ICT do not eliminate the need for such local operations.
Another example can be found in the automotive industry. In this industry,
major original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) structure their plant networks
globally, whilst making suppliers build their plants in the immediate vicinity of
the OEM plant. The distance or broadcasting horizon between the two plants is
defined by the time between the electronic ordering of a specifically finalised
single module on the online system and the expected time of delivery in sequence
along the assembly line. Time horizons for order preparation, finalisation,
shipment and delivery tend to be in the area of an hour and a half or less. This
causes localisation of the supplier or co-location, whilst the OEM plant services a
continental or even global market.

4.4.2 The evolving role of individual plants
Ferdows (1989) projects the theories by Bartlett and Ghoshal (1989) onto the role
of individual plants/factories in achieving the targeted international capabilities
of global efficiency, local responsiveness and worldwide learning, or a combina­
tion of the three. Using the same type of approach, with location considerations
on the horizontal axis and performed activities on the vertical axis, van Hoek
(1998) adjusted the model for distribution centres. The model indicates the way
in which the growth of performed activities changes the demands placed on the
capabilities of the plant and changes the location requirements. Location is con­
cerned with the response of governments to globalisation: adjusting local taxes,
incentives and infrastructure to favour selection of their territory.
In Figure 4.10 a traditional warehouse is projected to possibly develop into a
semi-manufacturing operation with product finalisation amongst its responsibili­
ties and added value. This also contributes to the creation of a flexible facility for
responding to local markets. The model also indicates a possible downgrading of the
plant, with its arrows showing development paths. These developments could be
driven by poor location conditions, an inability to reach supply chain objectives,
or the ability to reach the supply chain objectives more easily at other plants in the
company's network. This suggests that the role of individual plants could be seen as





Figure 4.10

Changing role o f distribu tion centres

an internal competitive issue for plant management. Most relevant, the evolution­
ary roles and functions of individual plants within the evolving supply chain are
specific issues of concern for the realisation of global objectives.

4.4.3 Reconfiguration processes
Related to this last point, the achievement of the required changes in interna­
tional logistics pipelines is a central issue. In the research presented in Figure 4.6
(van Hoek, 1998), it was found that, across companies, large differences can be
found in reconfiguration paths. This was found even in cases where the same sup­
ply chain structure (a traditional factory warehouse, as displayed in Figure 4.10)
was targeted. Differences included:
• Supply chain scope/activities involved. Was only final manufacturing relocated, or
did sourcing undergo the same treatment?
• Focus. Were activities moved into the market, e.g. localised or centralised w ith­
in the market? Did the move have a single or multiple focus?


• Tendency. Were activities moved out of the (European) market or vice versa,
with single or multiple tendencies?
• Timetable. Was it a single-step process or did it involve various steps spanning
out the process over a longer period of time?
• Pace. Was it an overnight change or the result of a gradually changing process?
• Authority. Was it directed from a global base (top down) or built up region by
region (bottom up)?
The differences can be explained through differences in the supply chain
characteristics of companies, amongst which are:
• Starting point. Is the base structure localised or globalised?
• Tradition. Does the company have a long preceding history with the baseline in
the market, or can it be built up from scratch, in supply chain terms (brownfield
or greenfield)?
Table 4.6 summarises the differences found in companies implementing post­
poned manufacturing as an example of a reconfiguration process. The same argu­
m ent could be applied to the difference between a central European warehouse
and a country-based, localised distribution network.

Figures 4.11 and 4.12 represent the reconfiguration process from local distribu­
tion through logistics centralisation to postponed manufacturing (final manufac­
turing in the warehouse). The differences in the implementation path are based
upon the different starting points. The path with a localised starting point goes
through centralisation within Europe starting from autonomous, duplicated local
structures. The path with a global starting point builds a small European presence
and then migrates through the increase of European presence centrally (repre­
senting a further location into Europe, rather than a further centralisation from
within Europe).

Case study 4.4 offers an example of an approach to outsourcing that provides
an insight into the hidden difficulties that may be faced when moving from
'local' to Tow cost' supply.
CASE STUDY

4.4

Moving offshore - not so easy or straightforward: the
experience of Smiths Aerospace
Smiths Aerospace is a largely UK-based supplier to both m ilitary and civilian aircraft
and engine manufacturers, and is owned by General Electric of the USA. Several years
ago, Smiths launched an initiative to outsource production of parts from UK suppliers
to Chinese suppliers in a drive to benefit from lower costs. Amongst the beneficia­
ries of the new initiative was the Mechanical Systems Division, which intended to
source high-volume, low-cost products from lean, low-cost suppliers in China. The
remaining volume was to be sourced from domestic suppliers that could operate
more flexibly (Section 1.3.2). The scope of the restructuring included machined civil­
ian aircraft parts from four UK sites under the Mechanical Systems Division, based in
four locations in the UK: Wolverhampton, Cheltenham, Hamble and Dowty Propellers
(Gloucester).
Global supply chain teams based in the UK and the USA, in conjunction w ith each
of the Smiths Aerospace divisions, were given responsibility for the deployment of the
outsourcing programme. The reconfigured supply chain was to result in the transition
of approximately 5,000 to 15,000 parts from traditional suppliers to low-cost economy
suppliers over a five-year period. Plans stated that, on average, 40 per cent of the spend
would remain within the UK because of high switching costs. As the long-term contracts
expired, the parts would either be manufactured internally or outsourced, depending
on intellectual property rights and technology protection. However, several years into
the initiative, only parts of the original plans have been accomplished. Much of the
delay was attributable to the change process, which was not so simple as originally
envisioned. There were also challenges w ith how that change was being managed. For
example, in the words of one company executive:
Failure to manage exit from the existing supplier, and failure to coordinate
the transition, led to catastrophic failure o f supply.
In this restructuring initiative, several keys to a successful supply chain initiative have
been met:
•
•
•
•
•

The initiative directly relates to corporate strategic priorities and there is top execu­
tive recognition of its importance.
There are clear considerations for switching production to China.
There is a clear business (four units, tw o of which serve as pilots) and operating
scope defined (those that require less flexibility).
There is a launch point for 'quick wins' (high volume, labour intensive parts).
Teams around the world have been allocated to the initiative.

However, as is also clear from the above quote from the executive, there are real risks
involved. As much as there have been many companies moving supply chain operations
to China, there are also clear negative impacts on supply chain performance that need
to be considered and incorporated into the change plan.


Q uestions

1 What are the risks in relocating parts of the supply chain and how can they be
incorporated into the plan for change?
2 Despite the recognised need to coordinate the transition process, the sites lacked
a documented method to specify how this would take place. There were also chal­
lenges w ith the change process itself. Propose what steps m ight have been included
to address these shortcomings.

4.5 Managing for risk readiness
Key issue: D eveloping a p p ro p ria te responses to risk in b o th th e s h o rt and long

te rm .

Supply chain disruptions such as transportation breakdowns and geopolitical
risks can have many impacts: empty distribution channels, stores and goods
stuck upstream leading to lost sales, revenue and customers. And they can be the
result of plant shutdowns due to supplier discontinuity or collapse, bottlenecks in
the transportation system or many other events in the supply chain.
During the 2013 horsemeat scandal, horsemeat was discovered in grocery store
food products labelled beef (ready-made lasagne, burgers and pasta sauce). The
scandal provoked a lot of debate, along with a renewed appreciation in the pub­
lic eye for the complexity of international supply chains and the risks that exist
across them - supply chain became big news but for the wrong reasons! The
scandal was discovered through standard food testing at the grocery store level the mislabelled product had made it all the way through the supply chain and it
wasn't until the very last mile of the supply chain that it was discovered.
Tesco was one of the first to recall meat products and the CEO outlined new
measures to shorten the supply chain and build closer working relationships with
farmers. As part of a plan to bring 'bring food closer to hom e' he promised that all
fresh chicken would be sourced from within the UK - 'no exceptions’. Tesco fresh
beef is already sourced in the UK (Mercer, 2013).
This shows what's at stake for supply chains. Despite this being a food label­
ling issue, rather than concerning food safety, the reaction of the consumers and,
subsequently, retailers, was dramatic with the demand for related meat products
falling off a cliff.
The challenge with risk in a supply chain context is that it can originate far
upstream and is difficult to diagnose early. Press coverage of the scandal spoke
of complex supply chains involving meat sourced and shipped through multiple
countries and supplier operations. Nothing new when you consider the average
supply chain these days...
The tru th is th at companies cannot prevent risks from occurring - the key
is to know about risks earlier th an the com petition and to be ready to respond
better th a n the com petition. There are at least two levels at which companies




are responding to risk in international logistics: preparing for im m ediate
response to risks and structurally preparing for risk in international supply
chains.

3 Develop possible response actions against the occurrence of risk factors.
Risk factor

Macro level risks in the

In addition to time-to-market and inventory risks, events of recent years have
forced companies to adapt to the new supply chain reality of expecting the unex­
pected. Companies are not only responding to current volatility and geopolitical
risks, they are also developing new risk management approaches based upon the
realisation that decades of globalising supply chains has come at a price: a height­
ened and different risk profile.
Geopolitical threats

The narrow water between the Middle East and Africa leading up to the Suez Ca­
nal has seen a lot of pirate activity in recent years, with pirates trying to board and
kidnap cargo ships and starting hostage negotiations. Terror threats and height­
ened government security efforts impact flows of goods on a day-to-day basis. Lo­
gistics in making the global economy a reality can never be a given that deserves
no second thought.
Transportation breakdowns

Transportation may be a commodity, but that does not mean that nothing can
go wrong. A thread of strikes in US west coast ports in 2013 drove companies to


reroute ships to avoid the situation during the 2002 strikes when hundreds of
cargo ships were floating outside the ports and shipments were not arriving at US
destinations. This meant that factories were shut down and stores were emptying.
It also had a ripple effect on global trade overall. For example, return shipments
were delayed because no ships were leaving the ports either. In addition, with so
m any ships and containers tied up, other routes could not be served. In fact, a
resulting global shortage of containers caused a slowdown of shipments in many
other port regions. So shipments on other routes, in different harbours, and even
shipments using different modalities, were affected.

4.5.1

Immediate risk readiness
Recent events have shown that immediate responses to risks can include four
things:
• raising inventory levels to assure a cushion for supply disruptions of key parts
and supplies;
• redrawing transportation scenarios in the light of the possible logistics melt­
down of global trade routes;
• putting into place supplier hedges are put into place; and
• actively reconsidering global sourcing and supplier rationalisation efforts are
being reconsidered actively.

Inventory policies to reflect volatility levels

Shortly after the Japanese tsunami, Toyota asked its suppliers to support raised
risk readiness. Executive vice-president Shinichi Sasaki, who oversees purchasing,
told Reuters that Toyota has mapped over 500 direct suppliers in Japan, which has
identified 1,500 sites producing components. Of this, 300 were 'at risk' and they
are single sources for close to 1,000 parts. In order to reduce the risk that another
disaster would bring, Toyota is asking its suppliers to spread production to m ul­
tiple sites or to hold extra stock.
Re-do transportation network redesign

Based upon possible risks or a real situation, scenarios for transportation routes at
risk can be developed, together with contingency plans on a route-by-route and
plant-to-plant basis.
Reconsider sole an d g lo bal sourcing arrangements

Despite the benefits of supplier rationalisation and focused factories, risk
management does imply there is real rationale for lining up alternative suppliers
in different locations, and for manufacturers to develop a thorough understanding
of their suppliers' capabilities and vulnerabilities. Companies are responding in
two ways: considering alternative and back-up sources; and proactively auditing




the supply base for financial and operational sustainability in these tough times.
Hewlett-Packard, for example, has secondary suppliers for all critical components
as part of its continuity plan.

4.5.2 Structural risk readiness
Because risk needs to be an ongoing focus, companies are increasingly devoting
dedicated teams to risk management in the supply chain. These teams can do
several things:
• develop contingency plans and risk protocols;
• audit preparedness;
• train plant m anagement and staff;
• report to senior management on risk profiles and preparedness.

CASE STUDY 4.5 Dana risks screening
Gary Baugh, senior director of purchasing for Dana's Power Technologies Group, says:
Our success as a company is dependent upon having a strong and viable sup­
ply base. The more we can plan, the better cost control we can have, and the
better we can mitigate impact to our plants, and most importantly, mitigate
impact to our customers. Part of this has been Dana conducting a financial risk
analysis of new suppliers, as well as ensuring its buyers have worked out risk
mitigation plans for those suppliers who are seen as a medium to high risk.
Source: www.procurementleaders.com/news/news/auto-supplier-dana-focuses-on-supply-chainrisk?highlight=Dana

Key in this example and others is that risk screening is not limited to the
organisation but done across the supply chain, involving suppliers - multiple
tiers if possible. It includes the development of a heat map of regions, supplies
and suppliers to keep a closer eye on mapping possible triggers and flags at various
levels of aggregation (such as supplier solvency, shipm ent issues) and considering
responses to risks before they happen.

4.6 Reverse logistics
Key issue: Factoring in the return flow of goods when designing international

networks.

Reverse logistics deals with the flow of goods that go back up the supply chain
for a num ber of reasons, including: product returns, repairs, m aintenance and
end-of-life returns for recycling or dismantling. Reverse logistics has both a


service (repair, recalls, etc.) and an environmental component. Corporate social
responsibility considerations will be covered in more detail in Section 4.7. Mean­
while, Table 4.7 - from the Reverse Logistics Executive Council - compares re­
verse logistics with forward logistics.
Table 4.7

Comparing forward and reverse logistics

Forward logistics

Reverse logistics

Forecasting relatively straightforward
One to many distribution points
Product quality uniform
Product packaging uniform
Destination/routing clear
Pricing relatively uniform
Importance of speed recognised
Forward distribution costs easily visible
Inventory management consistent
Product lifecycle manageable
Negotiation between parties straightforward
Marketing methods well known
Visibility of process more transparent

Forecasting more difficult
Many to one distribution point
Product quality not uniform
Product packaging often damaged
Destination/routing unclear
Pricing dependent on many factors
Speed often not considered a priority
Reverse costs less directly visible
Inventory management not consistent
Product lifecycle issues more complex
Negotiations complicated by several factors
Marketing complicated by several factors
Visibility of process less transparent

(Source: Reverse Logistics Executive Council, www.rlec.org)

Reasons why reverse logistics is often only partially incorporated into interna­
tional network design include:
• no infrastructure: companies often try to use the same outbound distribution
system to handle returns without considering whether it is fit for purpose;
• reverse logistics is often a 'corner-of-the-desk concern', and does not receive
sufficient resources;
• much attention on the subject is driven by legislation, not yet by recognised
business value;
• focal firms see reverse logistics as a cost of doing business;
• the subject is intuitively not popular: it means something has gone wrong, so
people are tem pted to ignore it or hide it;
• it is hard to forecast the reverse flow and composition - what is going to come
back.
Opinions indicate that there are operational shortcomings, such as using the
same infrastructure for the return flow, and finding it difficult to forecast reverse
flow. These might be explained by a lack of m anagement attention, and by lack
of appreciation of the full costs of reverse logistics. On the other hand, potential
downsides of a reactive approach include image risks, service shortfalls and being
a nuisance to customers. Suggested ways forward include considering the full
impact of reverse logistics and approaching it as a business:
• consider reverse logistics for its full cost and negative potential market impact;
• seek green as a business ('green is green');
• design for disassembly and recycling;




• outsource reversed operations to a specialist 3 PL;
• create dedicated (parts of) operations.
Cisco Systems offers a good case example of the migration from reversed
logistics as a burden to it as a business opportunity.

CASE STUDY

4.6

Cisco Systems value recovery programme
In 2005, Cisco Systems dealt with US$500 million of returned products and parts
through a cost centre whose annual operating cost was just US$8 million. All returns
were treated as defective product and service returns w ith the rationale being that all
returns were w ithout value. Furthermore, 95 per cent of all returns were scrapped. The
5 per cent of returns that were re-used were therefore more accidental than by design.
The US$500 million in scrap products and parts was equal to a volume of 12 football
fields covered knee high with defective products and parts.
Cisco Systems made the transition towards a profit-making value recovery operation
by setting criteria for value recovery and screening all returns for embedded value. The
criteria include:
•
•

Can a cosmetic 'touch up' or software upgrade be performed?
Can they be broken down into spares or parts or go into the secondary market or
even be donated to philanthropy?
The lessons learned from this programme for Cisco Systems included:

1 Do not treat all returns the same. There are products and parts that are beyond sav­
ing but, more often than not, things can be used in different ways to generate value.
2 Uncovering this value requires getting into the details of the product to identify pos­
sible ways to recover value and assess the opportunity to do this with a specific
product.
3 Most returns are not defective but are returned for other reasons.

4 Take a broad view of the opportunity. Think of reverse logistics as a business and
approach it like a general manager, not looking only for pennies or operational
issues, but instead looking for what value can be brought to other parts of the
organisation such as the corporate social responsibility (CSR) department and so­
cial efforts.
5 Learn from other functions. It may require you to take pages from the service
manual, learn from finance on quantifying value (returns can provide a tax w rite­
off when they are donated to philanthropic causes) and learn from the sales
departm ent in running a value recovery programme effectively (focus on solution
selling, segment the business for opportunities, establish return quotas and value
recovery targets).
As a result of the programme, 44 per cent of returns are now re-used and returns have
moved from a cost centre to a net contribution of US$85 million. This is on top of the
non-financial environmental and social benefits.

Question

1 Do you consider that Cisco's value recovery criteria can be applied to any supply
chain? Consider the Nike supply chain presented in Case study 4.3 for example.

4.7 Corporate social responsibility in the supply chain
Key issue: Companies operating international or global supply chains need to
incorporate social responsibility into their supply chain design.

In Chapter 1, we covered sustainability and the 'triple bottom line'. Corporate
social responsibility (CSR) has developed a m om entum of its own, and now
largely overlaps sustainability. Here, we explore the concept of CSR as it is
being developed by various focal firms, especially in the context of interna­
tional logistics. Broadly defined, CSR in the supply chain deals with the social
and environm ental consequences of supply chain operations. Making a global
supply chain environm entally sustainable and socially considerate is harder
th an just doing so for a focal firm. This is due to global reach and the fact that
m ultiple companies are involved. As a result, it is harder to assess and improve
operating policies across the entire supply chain. Yet this is a key opportunity
to bring CSR to life.
Two examples illustrate the issues:
• In 2006, the ship Probo Koala was redirected from the port of Amsterdam in
the Netherlands to C ôte d'Ivoire, where it dum ped its waste. But a Dutch in­
quiry found the 'waste' was more than 500 tonnes of a mixture of fuel, caus­
tic soda and hydrogen sulphide. The waste was dum ped in 12 sites around
the capital of C ôte d'Ivoire, Abidjan. The gas released by these chemicals was
blamed by the United Nations and the governm ent of Côte d'Ivoire for the
deaths of 17 and the injury (ranging from mild headaches to severe burns of
skin and lungs) of over 30,000 Ivorians. A November 2006 Ivorian Govern­
m ent report into the incident said that Trafigura, the shipping line which
owned Probo Koala, was to blame for the dum ping of waste, and was aided
by Ivorians. A governm ent committee concluded that Trafigura knew that
the nation had no facilities to store such waste and knowingly transported
it from Europe to Abidjan. In late 2008, a criminal prosecution was begun in
the Netherlands by the Dutch Public Prosecutors office: Trafigura, the cap­
tain of Probo Koala and the port of Amsterdam authorities were charged with
'illegally transporting toxic waste into and out of Amsterdam harbour' and
falsification of the chemical composition of the ship's cargo (Leigh and
Hirsch, 2009).




Activity 4.6
Review the evidence for this disaster which is detailed at:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ 2006_C%C3%B4te_d'lvoire_toxic_waste_dump
Who was to blame for the Probo Koala disaster in Côte d'Ivoire in 2006? What are the CSR
implications of what happened?

• Nike came under heavy scrutiny from customers in the 1990s for its use of lowcost labour, predominantly in Asia. There were suspicions of use of child labour
(Case study 4.7), and other unethical labour practices amongst Nike suppliers.
Nike launched a comprehensive CSR effort - including the appointm ent of a
vice-president for CSR - and now is considered to be a leader for improving
supplier practices and for responsible behaviour along the supply chain.
CSR has caught both public and political attention, and companies are devel­
oping approaches that span the spectrum displayed in Figure 4.13. Worst practice
in CSR is for companies to publish a CSR report and to engage in PR efforts to
make the company look responsible, yet hide behind the approach:
I can't see everything in m y supply chain that happens on the other side o f the
globe in another com pany, so I ca n ’t m anage that.

So not much changes in day-to-day operations - other than telling suppliers
that they 'need to be responsible for their actions'.
Telling suppliers to 'shape up' cannot be expected to have much of an impact.
One example of a weak response to CSR is that of a focal firm which said, 'we
ask our suppliers to adhere to the rules, and if we have a continued suspicion of
improper conduct we send them a letter'. Not only does that not help suppliers
to develop, it also does not take active ownership of the challenge. Even worse whilst this was happening - the firm continued to award business based on

Figure 4.13

supplier price levels, with no consideration for the impact of these price levels
on labour practices. But progress can be made in comparatively difficult circum­
stances, as Case study 4.7 illustrates.

Eliminating child labour from the Sialkot football industry
Nearly 75 per cent of footballs were produced in Pakistan, mostly in the Sialkot district,
Pakistan's 'export capital' close to the border with India. However, an International
Labour Organisation (ILO) study in 2002 showed that more than 7,000 children aged
between 7 and 14 were stitching footballs on a full-time basis, working between
10 and 11 hours/day and earning between PKR 20 and 22 per ball (€1 = PKR 81).
Production ranged from three to five balls/day per person. An article in Life magazine
appeared in j une 1996, featuring Tariq, a 12-year-old, stitching balls in Sialkot. This
resulted in pressure on international brands such as Adidas, Reebok and Nike to ensure
that their products were not produced with child labour. The ILO brokered the Atlanta
Agreement (2001) to eliminate child labour from the football industry through improved
monitoring.
However, m onitoring was d ifficult to implement. Local 'manufacturers' outsourced
work to middlemen, who in turn dealt w ith home-based stitchers. These could be
whole families, including children. Payment was on a 'fixed price' basis, so there was
no cost advantage whether the worker was adult or child. The anonymous nature of
the network meant that manufacturers had no idea w hat age of worker was involved.
An independent monitoring committee was set up, and manufacturers were invited
to register. Once registered, manufacturers had to declare details of their entire network including the number of stitchers, daily production, location of stitching centres and
names of the middlemen. This was to be done gradually over a period of 18 months.
And, once declared, stitching centres were to be subject to random visits. If child labour
was discovered, the manufacturer was instructed to fix the situation. Repeated viola­
tions resulted in the manufacturer being withdrawn from the register and reported to
international buyers and retailers. Within a few years, practically all of the manufacturers
had registered.
Saga Sports, the largest manufacturer, decided to go a step further. It would stop the
use of child labour completely by eliminating outsourcing and concentrating produc­
tion in custom-built stitching facilities which Saga would manage. Whilst Pakistani law
allowed children to start work at the age of 14, Saga decreed that it would only employ
workers aged 18 or over. Age would be verified against national identity cards and birth
certificates. Once confirmed, employees benefited from a pay structure 'equivalent
to university teachers in Pakistan'. Employee benefits, such as free health checks and
medical help, meals and transport, were introduced. Saga saw these benefits as com­
pensation to families who had lost income as a result of the elimination of child labour.
Whilst Saga's actions have helped to purge child labour from the football stitching
industry in an exemplary way, there are other sectors in which children can earn money.
Sialkot is also famous for leather goods and surgical goods, where international pressures
are more difficult to focus. Easy availability of work, lack of meaningful education
opportunities and a 'poverty of thought' prevalent in the community could mean that
the problem may only be transferred elsewhere.

Questions

1 What further changes are needed for there to be a sustainable change in the inci­
dence of child labour in developing countries such as Pakistan?
2 Consider the 2013 collapse of a Bangladeshi clothing factory and discuss links with
the above case problem.

More progressive firms are now beginning to use CSR as a market lever - not
only to make them look good in the eyes of the consumer, but to expand the firm
with new products at premium prices. An example is 'fair trade' products. Such
firms are taking active ownership over the challenge - for example, NEC goes into
considerable detail to specify CSR actions for suppliers in a lengthy handbook it
has published. Nike has appointed a CSR vice-president, as noted above. Finally,
companies such as NEC, Nike and HP invest time and resources in helping sup­
pliers develop into more CSR-adept firms. They visit suppliers, conduct audits to
identify improvement opportunities and proactively carve out opportunities to
collaborate on achieving improvements.
Examples of CSR efforts include:
• incorporating CSR standards and suggested efforts in purchasing policies (see
the NEC example above and Table 4.8);
• conducting supplier audits to identify improvement opportunities, and follow­
ing up on issues that are found (do not say you can't see it when you can go
and look);
• taking ownership of CSR initiatives by running supplier development sessions,
and by collaborating on improvement projects.

CASE STUDY 4.5 Embedding CSR at Akzo
Akzo, the Dutch-based chemicals and coatings company, owner of ICI and many other
brands, has appointed a CSR officer to drive and coordinate CSR efforts across the com­
pany. To drive ownership, consideration and focus broadly across the company and in
all the decisions it makes, tw o simple things are done:
1 Every proposal that the Board is asked to decide upon must be accompanied by
a CSR and sustainability evaluation, otherwise it w ill not be considered by the
Board.
2 Personal targets for senior management across the company include as a key perfor­
mance indicator (KPI) the company's position in the Dow Jones sustainability index.




As (a) the largest company in the world by revenue taking sustainability seri­
ously, (b) doing so in a cost effective m anner and (c) on an international scale,
Wal-Mart is setting some challenging targets with its supply chain partners, as
described in Case study 4.9.

CASESTUDY4.9

Wal-Mart's sustainability programme
Wal-Mart has set three ambitious goals for sustainability:
1 To be supplied by 100 per cent renewable energy.
2 To create zero waste.
3 To sell products that sustain the environment.
In moving towards these goals, several key projects have been rolled out, including
changing store design to use more natural light as opposed to electrical light, and catch­
ing rain from store roofs and AC units for watering the landscape.
On its fleet, the company has introduced auxiliary power units so that, when waiting
idle for more than three minutes, the main engine turns off. It is estimated that this alone
will lead to US$23 million in fuel savings per year.
Furthermore, the company worked with its supplier of private label toys to remove
excess packaging from 277 children's construction toy SKUs and to reduce the size of
the package. This alone will lead to 727 fewer shipping containers and a US$3.5 million
saving in transportation costs. Additionally, the company recognises a marketing advan­
tage, as customers frequently ask for sustainability improvements.

4.8 Establishing global governance of the supply chain
Key issue: The need to organise and manage teams across the geographical span
of a global supply chain, centrally, decentrally and anything in between.

Whilst the preceding sections did include managerial considerations in discuss­
ing the organisation of international logistics, it is worth reviewing more specifi­
cally how modern supply chains can be governed effectively. Effective governance
needs to be ensured not just through the location of operations, the structure of
flows of goods and the centralisation of hubs and distribution centres, but across
all of these tiers and layers, organisational units and the parties involved in the
supply chain. Considerations include: (1) how to centralise governance of decentrally located operations; (2) how to effectively incorporate new regions in the
global governance; and (3) how to consider organising ownership of goods across
the supply chain.


4.8.1

Decentralised centralisation
The trade-off between centralised versus decentralised has been discussed in the
context of operations, warehouses and flows in the preceding sections. W hen it
comes to governance, the relevant questions include whether or not to centralise
the m anagement of the supply chain or to allow for partial, or fully, decentralised
m anagement with coordination between units. Because of the complexity and
reach of the supply chain, it is uncom m on to target complete centralisation of
governance, even within the boundaries of one company in the supply chain.
Angela Zhang, senior director of global sourcing at Sony Mobile, offers a good
example:
We have em bedded the com pany's Asia procurem ent team in to the global leader­
ship structure of procurem ent and have adjusted its procurem ent practices globally
to reflect in novation s from the region. Distributed virtual team s have becom e the
n ew norm.

This virtual centralisation centres on the creation of teams of decision mak­
ers and operators that work together, despite being located in different tiers,
locations and even companies. This structure allows for local responsiveness
and expertise and, at the same time, coordination and shared learning across
units. Eva Wimmers is senior vice-president at Deutsche Telecom and is in
charge of logistics and procurement. She has centralised teams and governance
across her organisation, but not by relocating people. Her rule is: 'The worst
thing you can do w hen centralising is to centralise'. W hat she means is that
teams can be centrally reporting and have responsibilities larger than the opera­
tion in which they are based, but they do not have to be located in a big cor­
porate head office. The huge benefit of this form of decentralised centralisation
is that key managers remain close to the operation, to business stakeholders
and to markets. Avoiding the risk of creating ivory towers can be particularly
valuable in the supply chain where, as we know, little can be achieved w ithout
collaboration between stakeholders.

A ctivity 4.8
Reconsider the case for and against centralisation and decentralisation from earlier in this chapter
and now add to that the governance dimension; what are the benefits of centrally managing
versus local autonomy with coordination between management units?

4.8.2 Incorporating new regions into global governance
With regions in the world taking more comm on and prom inent places in in­
ternational supply chains, governance structures need to be adjusted to accom­
modate this geographical spread and complexity. Whilst Africa is a growth area
for raw material sourcing and Latin America has fast growing markets, Asian




involvement in supply chains has gone far beyond the trading post outposts of
the past. Whilst China is no longer the best location for low factor costs in all
cases, companies are moving more investments into China and the region for
market reasons.

f

SC Johnson in Asia
SC Johnson, the consumer products company, has gone through a major development
in its Asian procurement operations, in an effort to incorporate the region into the
global governance. Whilst, in the past, Asia was a more removed decentralised outpost
with support managers who operated locally, Sanna Norman (regional procurement
director, Asia) has transformed the organisation in recent years to have strategic roles,
as can be seen from Table 4.9.
This change did involve losing 50 per cent of the team in tw o years as more opera­
tional and traditional managers no longer 'felt at home' with the training and teaming
of the rest of the organisation. Amongst the keys to success, according to Sanna, was
retaining strong links to local business leaders (in line w ith the advice of the previous
section), investing in creating social issues on the team and engaging key stakeholders
in the business case and the change process.

CASE STUDY

4.11

Rio Tinto's buy-sell model
Rio Tinto is a globally operating mining company that has created central buying
centres, including one in Singapore where dedicated teams buy in the supply market
against forecasted demand from businesses inside Rio Tinto. This is different from tra­
ditional models in which procurement buys on behalf of other units and does not take
ownership and, as a result, has less leverage in the market. Obviously this model does
require that the governance approach ensures that the buying centre is very closely
aligned with business needs. In the words of Daniel Koempel, global sourcing leader,
carbon products:
We have changed our model. We operate a buy-sell model for some of our
categories in which we are buying and taking position in the market our­
selves and then resell these products to our businesses globally. The busi­
nesses also pay us for our services, that means - in a nutshell - if we do not
do a good job, we do not get paid and we can go home.

Figure 4.14

Regional vs global procurement model comparison

4.8.3 Ownership of goods in the international flow of goods
Whilst products in the international flow of goods m ight pass through coun­
tries and companies, ownership m ight not follow the same path. Third party
logistics companies ship, store and handle goods but do not take ownership




of them. However, wholesalers do take ownership of goods and, similarly, sup­
pliers transfer ownership to their customers. This obviously further challenges
transparency and visibility from a risk point of view and needs to be managed.
W hilst m any companies m ight have goods pass through legal entities en route
to the customer, there are alternative, newer approaches that companies can use.
The concept of a logistics control tower is an operation that can be outsourced
or run internally, literally to perform the role of overseeing and coordinating flows
of goods internationally. This enables consolidation of shipments, better oversees
risks and creates improved coordination of movements. In addition to that, com­
panies are setting up buying centres that purchase on behalf of other legal entities,
against their forecasted needs, and sell to these units when these supplies are actu­
ally needed. This enables consolidation of spend, focused operations and econo­
mies of scale, whilst local units can still call off 'when needed', instead of 'when
available'.

Summary
W hy in tern a tio n a l logistics?

• A m ajor driver of the internationalisation of business has been labour
shortages and costs in established markets, and the availability of low cost
production in newly industrialised regions. A further driver has been the
need to follow customers into new local markets, and to create new learning
opportunities.
• This has created phases in internationalisation of operations, and hence of the
logistics pipelines that are associated with them. Logistics pipelines differ from
market to market and from company to company over time.
• Global sourcing can create economies of scale for transportation through
multiple consolidation as organisations orchestrate their global networks, and
focus key areas such as manufacturing and R&D.
W h a t are the logistics im plications o f in ternationalisation?

• Despite the obvious benefits of global sourcing, firms should not ignore the

logistical complexities and operational costs associated with sourcing globally
(including longer shipment times and higher shipping costs) when deciding
their internationalisation strategies. Increased complexities and costs often
are ignored or only partially recognised in the rush to obtain lower piece-part
prices.
H o w do we organise for in te rn a tio n a l logistics?

• New solutions for layering and tiering the supply network are being tried out,

such as co-location of suppliers with OEM plants in the auto industry. M ean­
while, the role of individual plants may be modified to allow more flexible
response to local markets, for example by carrying out final assembly in local
distribution centres.


• The key to success of internationalisation strategies is the rationalisation of
sourcing, production and distribution. At the same time, the organisation needs
to be sensitive to local markets and preferences. Crucial, also, is to ensure risk
preparedness in international supply chains and to factor in corporate social
responsibility policies proactively, whilst also ensuring that governance of the
supply chain allows for the complexity of the supply chain around the globe,
with distributed teams and operations.

1 What are the benefits and limitations of international logistics? Illustrate your response
by referring to sourcing of standard shirts and fashion blouses (shown in Table 1.2

Managing the lead-time frontier

Objectives

The intended objectives o f this chapter are to:

•

introduce time-based competition definitions and concepts;

•

show how the lead time needs to be managed to serve customer
expectations;

•

explain how organisations compete through responsiveness.

By the end o f this chapter you should be able to understand:

•

how organisations compete through managing lead time;

•

how tim e can be used as a performance measure;

•

P-times and D-times and the consequences when they do not match;

•

different solutions to reduce P-times.

Introduction
This chapter takes a strategic and a managerial view of time, and of the impact
of time on logistics performance. It provides an introduction to the nature of
time-based competition and how time can provide competitive advantage in
logistics. As we saw in Section 1.3, logistics supports the competitiveness of the
supply chain as a whole by meeting end-customer demand through supplying
what is needed, when it is needed and at low cost. Because logistics supports time
and place commitments in the supply chain, it can be argued that the lead-time
frontier accounts for at least half of logistics success.
Competing on time is the principle of taking timely completion of supply
chain tasks to a higher level: that of compressing cycle times for supply chain
operations for internal and external benefits. External benefits include:
• lowering overall cycle time and providing faster services;
• outrunning competition.
These benefits are especially im portant in the context of improving responsive­
ness to customers and volatile markets. Chapter 7 will return to these points by
addressing agile supply chains.




Internal benefits include:
• shorter cash-to-cash cycles, thereby releasing working capital, improving
liquidity and reducing asset intensity of the supply chain (as discussed in detail
in Chapter 3);
• lowering inventories in the supply chain by speeding up turnover times for
work in progress and inventory.
These benefits are especially im portant within lean or waste elimination ap­
proaches, as will be developed in Chapter 7. This chapter focuses on how timebased solutions link with competitive strategy. Chapter 6 provides an approach
to implementing a time-based approach (just-in-time) by eliminating waste and
improving material flow.

s This chapter addresses five key issues:
1 The role of tim e in competitive advantage: using tim e in logistics managem ent
and strategy.
2 P:D ratios and differences: the gap between the tim e it takes to produce the prod­
uct (P-time) and the tim e the customer is prepared to w ait (D-tim e).
3 Time-based process mapping: how to create visibility of tim e across the network.
4 M anaging timeliness in the logistics pipeline: strategies and practices fo r coping
when P-time is greater than D-time.
5 W hen, where and how? Tactical considerations in planning a time-based strategy.

5.1 The role of time in competitive advantage
Key issues: W hat is time-based competition, how does it link to other initiatives,
and w hat is the purpose of it?

5.1.1 Time-based competition: definition and concepts
Many attempts at business improvement focus on cost reduction and quality im­
provement. Whilst a great deal of benefit has been achieved by m any organisa­
tions through these efforts, most of the obvious opportunities for improvement
have now been taken. This has led to time emerging as a fresh battleground in the
search for competitive advantage. A working definition of competing on time is:
The tim ely response to custom er needs.

The emphasis in this definition is on 'timely'. This means responding to cus­
tomers' needs on time - neither early nor late. The implication of this definition
is that the organisation must focus its capabilities on being responsive to the
customer.
Traditionally, people often have the opinion that you cannot have low cost and
high quality, low cost and fast delivery, or fast delivery and high quality. The belief


is that some kind of trade-off is necessary, m eaning that more of one advantage
means less of another. For example, better quality means putting in more inspec­
tors, which increases costs. Such thinking was shown to be flawed when the qual­
ity movem ent of the 1980s demonstrated that good quality actually reduces costs
(Crosby, 1979). The trade-off between cost and quality can be altered by preventing
defects from happening in the first place through such measures as:
• designing the process so that defects cannot occur (error proofing);
• designing products so that they are easy to make and distribute;
• training personnel so that they understand the process and its limitations.
This leads to savings in detecting defects, by removing the need for inspection,
and in avoiding the failures that lead to scrap and the cost of resolving customer
complaints. The result is that overall quality costs (prevention + detection + failure)
can be reduced by spending more on prevention.
Understanding trade-off relationships lies at the heart of a focal firm's ability
to achieve competitive advantage. Relationships that need to be understood and
harnessed include recognising that:
• costs do not have to increase in order to improve quality - they can reduce;
• costs do not have to increase when lead times are reduced. It may be pos­
sible to reduce both in some processes by reducing waste in terms of unneces­
sary transportation or inventory, for example (refer to Chapter 7 for a detailed
account of wastes);
• costs do not have to go up as product variety increases and times reduce - they
can also reduce.
Each of these trade-offs has im portant links with strategy. A focus on respon­
siveness to the customer means that a focal firm needs to change the way it goes
about its business. This involves redesigning systems and processes to give prior­
ity to time. In these circumstances, cost plays a supporting role - since time and
cost have distinctive strategy implications (Section 1.4.4) and are not linearly
related (see Section 3.5.1 on cost - time profile).

5.1.2 Variety and complexity
One of the first challenges we have in describing logistics systems is to under­
stand the terms variety and complexity. Complexity is often used casually to refer
to things that we do not understand: as we understand more about a system, the
boundary of complexity recedes. Thus Galbraith (1977) defines complexity as the
difference between the information needed to perform a task and the informa­
tion actually possessed. A more helpful definition for logistics purposes, taken
from the science of evolution (Edmunds, 1999), is:
A system is com p lex w h en it is difficult to form ulate its overall behaviour, even w hen
given alm ost com plete inform ation about its com ponents and their relationships.

In logistics terms, we start to lose control as a system becomes more complex.
And the less complete the information, the more rapidly that control is lost.




Eventually, the system may descend into chaos, the potential supply chain im­
pacts of which we explore in Section 6.1.4. Mercedes offers 3.3 x 1024 possible
variations on its E-Class model, which is 'far more than the company could ever
sell in its entire existence' (Pil and Holweg, 2004). Only 17,000 of these variations
are said to matter to the end-customer, a situation that appears to be making the
logistics challenge unnecessarily complex. Here, the complexity of the E-Class is
being driven by variety, and it is useful to distinguish two types of variety:
• External variety: the choice offered to the end-customer, or potential finished
product SKUs. Choice soon builds up - an automotive example would be:
• 2 body styles x 15 power train combinations x 19 painted body colours x
15 trim colours x 70 factory fitted options = 600,000 variations
• Internal variety: converts external variety into the internal requirements placed
onto the supply chain. Holweg and Pil (2004) measured internal variety at
three levels in the product structure (for an example of a product structure, see
Case study 6.1): the basic product (models and body styles), intermediate (such
as power trains, wiring harnesses and body colours), and peripheral (number
and variety of components used).
These authors have used variety as a measure of complexity. Complexity makes it
progressively more challenging to plan and control the supply chain. Cooper and
Griffiths (1994) state that 'issues of variety and complexity are strongly linked',
and list three rules for managing complexity:
• Increased variety tends to add to the complexity of logistics operations, and so
increases both direct and indirect costs (Section 3.4.2).
• Variety should be increased only when it contributes to added value. Heineken,
the Dutch beer manufacturer, reduced SKUs from 2,500 across Europe to SKUs
in their 10s. The 'right' level of product variety starts with consumer research
(Mahler and Bahulkar, 2009) rather than 'tail cutting' (Activity 2.1).
• System redesign can enhance added value through reducing the cost impact of
an increase in variety. The antidote to complexity is simplicity, so auto manufac­
turers have implemented several ways to offer external variety without making
internal operations too complex (see Case studies 7.3 and 8.5).
Let us now return to the main theme of this chapter - time. Speed and depend­
ability can both be improved by simplifying logistics processes.

5.1.3 Time-based initiatives
W hen a company attacks time directly, the first benefits to show up are usually
shorter cycle times and faster inventory turns. Lower overhead costs usually fol­
low, as the costs of dealing with breakdowns and delays begin to disappear from
the system. So, by seeking time reduction, both time reduction and cost reduction
are often the rewards.
Attacking the sources and causes of delays helps reduce quality defects in prod­
uct and service. Thus, by focusing on time, customers' needs are met more quickly
and a quality benefit will often accompany the time benefit.


5.1.4 Time-based opportunities to add value
There are several ways in which a company can use time to help meet custom­
er needs better and therefore add more value. The most common examples of
this are:
• increased responsiveness to customer needs;
• managing increased variety;
• increased product innovation;
• improved return on new products;
• reducing risk by relying less on forecasts.
We deal with each of these opportunities in turn.
Increased responsiveness to customer needs

Increased responsiveness to customer needs is the m ost com m on reason for
organisations to invest in time-based approaches to performance enhance­
m ent. Many elem ents of customer service are dependent upon time. These
include how long it takes to deliver a product or service, achieving on-tim e
delivery and how long it takes to deal w ith customer queries, estimates and
complaints.
High levels of responsiveness to customers tend to correlate to greater loy­
alty from them and therefore more business over time. Such responsiveness is
also addictive to the customer, creating customer lock-in. Once they get used
to short lead times, industrial customers often reorganise their own products
and services to customers to make use of responsiveness from their suppliers,
such as by holding less inventory and promising their own customers shorter
lead times. Once they start to do this they find it hard to accept longer times
again.
Industrial customers of time-based organisations do not have to carry as much
raw material or com ponent stock and therefore benefit from a cost saving. In
order to profit from the service they provide, a time-based organisation needs to
demonstrate to customers that the total cost of doing business is lower, and then
recover some of this value. This can be achieved by winning more business and/
or by charging more.
M a n a g in g increased variety

We discussed the impact of variety on complexity of logistics operations in
Section 5.1.2. Shortened lead times in product development, the supply chain
and manufacturing help factories deliver a variety of products without the tradi­
tional cost penalty (as discussed in detail under agility in Chapter 7). The same is
also true of service organisations that can design and supply a range of new offer­
ings in line with changes in market needs. By reducing overall lead time, product
complexity and process set-up times, the production of a particular product can
be scheduled more frequently with smaller production batches. This improves
the variety of products available to a customer over a given time.




Increased product innovation

Time-based organisations are more likely to meet customer needs accurately by
using short product development times to produce new products that meet cus­
tomer needs. The shortening of product development lead time means that inno­
vations can be capitalised on to maximum effect. If a company innovates through
product design faster than its competitors it will become increasingly competi­
tive. Conversely, if your competitors are innovative, then reducing the time to
develop imitations will underpin a 'fast follower' strategy to keep up.
Improved return on new products

Reducing product development lead time means that a product can get to market
earlier. This has a num ber of important advantages:
• the sales life of the product is extended;
• a higher price can be charged;
• new customers can be won;
• a high market share can be won through building upon the initial lead.
Each of these benefits can add to the other. Therefore, being first to the m ar­
ket allows a higher initial price to be charged, helping to recoup developm ent
costs more quickly. This revenue will support investm ent into further develop­
m ents necessary to retain these initial customers. Meanwhile, the initial prod­
uct can continue to be sold, generating cash through its high market share.
Being first in the market maximises the product life until the time w hen it
becomes obsolete.
An impressive approach to the issue of obsolescence is attributed to Akio Morita,
the co-founder of Sony and inventor of the Walkman. He believed that it was his
job to make his own products obsolete before competitors did so. In effect, not
only was his aim to make innovative products, he also sought to build on this
success in the knowledge that, if he did not, then someone else soon would.
The related argument here is that of break-even time rather than the break­
even volumes discussed in Chapter 3. Traditional break-even analysis focuses
on the volume of product needed to be moved before the investment pays off.
Given shortening times-to-market and compressed product life cycles (e.g. from
6 m onths to 45 days of shelf life for Nike footwear) the analysis shifts towards the
question 'how long before break-even is reached?' Figure 5.1 illustrates the point.
As product lifecycles shrink, so the time window of opportunity for making
profits also shrinks. This consideration means that a new product must achieve
its break-even time more quickly.

Reducing risk by relying less on forecasts

There is a saying in industry that there are only two types of forecast: wrong ones
and lucky ones, and there are precious few of the latter! It is certainly true that
the further ahead a company tries to forecast, the less likely the forecast is to be
correct.



Figure 5.1

Break-even time

One of the aims of a time-based initiative is often to minimise how much fore­
casting is needed. By reducing the production lead time, the period when de­
m and is uncertain becomes shorter. Forecasting over a shorter time period results
in a more reliable forecast and therefore less risk of stock-outs or obsolete stock. It
also reduces the am ount of finished goods stock needed, which frees up working
capital.
In product development, risk is also reduced by shortening lead times. This is
achieved when the specification for the new product can be fixed with more cer­
tainty, thus improving the chances of market success.
The ultimate goal is to reduce production time so it lies within the lead time
it has been given by the customer to deliver. In this situation, no forecasting is
needed and all production is done in line with actual customer orders. The impli­
cations of reducing production time in relation to the demand time of customers
are very significant and we have devoted the whole of Section 5.2 to addressing
them.

5.1.5 Time-based opportunities to reduce cost
The second key element of time-based competition is to reduce cost and therefore
improve productivity through the elimination of non-value-added time in pro­
cesses. This means that wasted lead time and unnecessary tasks that are not actu­
ally adding any value in the customers' eyes should be identified and eliminated.
Stopping unnecessary tasks and removing wasted time from those that remain
lowers cost by:
• reducing the need for working capital;
• reducing the need for plant and equipm ent capital;




• reducing development costs;
• reducing quality costs.
We address each of these in turn.
Reducing working capital

Increasing the speed of flow through processes by eliminating unnecessary steps
and wasted time, reduces the am ount of money tied up in the system. In the short
term the focus will be upon inventory. Here, manufacturing lead time is inversely
proportional to work-in-progress levels. By focusing on time we decrease raw ma­
terial, work-in-progress and finished good stocks. Lowered inventory levels result
in reduced working capital. As already mentioned, returns on working capital will
be improved by reducing obsolescence caused by making to stock and not to order.
Reducing p la n t an d equipment capital

Over the longer term, processes become more visible, inventory levels reduce
and opportunities to minimise capital expenses become more visible. These op­
portunities include the removal of equipm ent not employed in activities that
add value. Initial items to remove will include the racking and pallets formerly
used to store inventory. Next will be a purge of unnecessary equipment in of­
fices, stores and production, including the jigging for unnecessary operations of
obsolete parts.
In terms of what to do with superfluous items, some may be sold and capital
recovered. The remaining items should just be skipped. Whilst it may seem stupid
simply to throw away equipment, given how much some items have cost, these
are sunk costs. If the equipm ent can no longer be used to generate revenue, all it
does is incur further costs, such as maintenance, and the floor space it occupies
will have many better uses.
As a company embraces time-based competition, success in the marketplace
will increase demand for products and services that the customer really values. To
make way for these means that space will be at a premium in the company. This
is just the driver needed to replace the old with the new.
Reducing development costs

Shortened lead times in product development are achieved in part by more effec­
tive use of development resources through elimination of rework and reduction
of distracting superfluous projects. This leads to cost reductions as the time spent
on a given project is less.
Reducing quality costs

One of the main elements in improving quality is to reduce the time between
an error being made and the problem being detected. The sooner the error is de­
tected the smaller the am ount of the product affected by it. Reducing lead times
has a positive effect on the speed of feedback and hence quality costs are reduced.


In keeping w ith the total quality m ovem ent, time-sensitive organisations
will become consistently responsive only if they strive to m aintain quality pro­
cesses. This means that, as defects and errors arise, they are detected quick­
ly, root causes are identified and effective solutions installed to ensure they
cannot recur.

Activity 5 . 1
List six applications of responsiveness in an organisation; for example, 'external phone calls an­
swered within five rings'. How many organisations can you think of that compete overtly on
time, such as the Vision Express example, given in Chapter 1?

5.1.6 Limitations to time-based approaches
Despite the clear benefits of time-based approaches to logistics management
described above, there are often barriers to its application, as well as limitations
to its relevance.
Two basic limitations to the need for time-based logistics m anagem ent are
the need for speed and the degree of speed required. Not all operating environ­
m ents require speed. Product dem and that is very predictable, such as highvolume, low-value com m odity products, can be planned well in advance and
processed w ithout a particular speed. Not all customers value speed as they may
be able to order well in advance of delivery. Delivery before the parts are needed
creates unnecessary inventories. In particular, when there are costs involved
in creating speedy delivery, customers may trade that off against ordering in
advance. Only selected parcels need to be shipped w ith express carriers, for
example.
A particular issue with the costs involved in speeding up logistics processes
in the supply chain is the distribution of those costs between companies in the
supply chain. It is well known that just-in-time (JIT) deliveries, for example, may
generate significant costs for suppliers, whereas the customer may experience
most of its benefits (such as low process inventories and rapid delivery). Toyota is
capable of manufacturing a car in five days, but has decided not to do so because
of the pressure it would place on its suppliers and its distribution processes, cre­
ating costs that are not expected to be outweighed by revenue opportunities in
current market circumstances.
An additional issue is that time-based approaches might lead to superior per­
formance only being achieved on a limited num ber of occasions. An illustration
of this situation is shown in Figure 5.2. In this example, a supplier demonstrates
that it is able to deliver in only one day. However, it is clear that this was achieved
for only a m inor portion of shipments, which does not mean that customers can
depend on shipments being consistently completed within a day. Rather custom­
ers will order seven days in advance, where the required 99 per cent service level
for deliveries is achieved. Time-based approaches are not about managing excep­
tions but managing for speed reliably.

5.2 P:D ratios and differences
Key issues: W hat are P- and D-times, and why are they im portant to logistics

strategy?

P-time and D-time are measures of performance of the supply pipeline. They are
explained in Section 5.2.2, but let us first look at the importance of time as a
performance measure.

5.2.1

Using time as a performance measure
One of the major advantages of a time-based approach to managing processes over
one based on cost or quality is the ease with which time is understood as a mea­
sure. Whilst cost and quality are open to differences in interpretation, time is an
absolute measure. Stalk and Hout (1990) refer to the 'time elasticity of price', where
the price that customers are prepared to pay is often related to the delivery speed.
For example, Talleres Auto, in Case study 1.6, was able to charge premium prices
for spare parts in breakdown situations because these were 'distress purchases'.
Cost is a more subjective measure that is open to interpretation, three examples
of which we saw in Section 3.4. Many people have a poor grasp of how costs work
in practice, and do not understand how the actions they take affect others. An all
too frequent example is saving costs in one part of the supply network only to
cause extra costs elsewhere. Whilst quality is an important area for organisations to
improve, there are a number of different ways to interpret 'quality'. Garvin (1988)
lists eight dimensions o f quality, which depend on the perspective taken, such as
product quality (design), conformance quality (manufacturing) and fitness for use
(customer). In order for quality measures to be useful, they often require a statisti­
cal approach that can easily be misunderstood by those who have not been explic­
itly trained. Deming's famous Monte Carlo experiments with a funnel and glass
marble (Deming, 1986: 327) illustrate the perils of interfering with a stable process:


If an yone adjusts a stable process to try to com pensate for a result that is undesir­
able, or for a result that is extra good, the output that follow s w ill be worse than if
he had left the process alone.

Frequent interference in a stable process increases the variability of its output!
Time, on the other hand, is a measure that everyone understands. Every person
has access to the exact duration of a second, m inute or hour, thanks to clocks
using the same units of time. Time allows people across an organisation, with
very little training, to measure the performance of a process or activity. Using this
measure anyone can answer the key question:
D o w e m eet the target the custom er has set for us?

By comparing this measure with one taken for the performance of competitors,
we can easily answer the next key question:
H ow good are w e com pared w ith the com petition?

If we take a reason for measuring performance as being to understand the effect of
making changes to a process, we can more easily answer the question:
Is our perform ance getting better or worse?

By using measures that are simple to understand, people can see the big issues
more easily. They can measure and quantify the flow of activities directly, and
ask themselves whether each of the steps in a process is adding real value or just
adding cost. By following the flow through a process we can see where time is lost.
This allows us to translate the data into time-reduction and cost-reduction oppor­
tunities. Looking at cost analyses alone does not tell anyone where to save time.

5.2.2 Using time to measure supply pipeline performance
In the same way that time can be used to measure the performance of a process
within a company, so it can be used to measure the supply pipeline. Two measures
are presented below (and illustrated in Figure 5.3) that are key to understanding
supply pipeline performance: P-time and D-time.
P-time

The first measure of performance for the total supply process is to determine how
long it takes for a product or service to pass through it. This measure is used to
identify the total logistics lead time, also known as the P-time or production time.
Just to be clear, the P-time is a measure of the total time it takes for a product
to go through a pipeline. Thus it includes source, make and deliver lead times: it
is not just the time it takes to supply from stock.
The measure starts the m om ent a new order is raised. It includes all the time
needed to take a product through all the processes necessary to make and deliver
that product including time in storage (work-in-progress or finished inventory). It
is important to be clear about when these activities start and end in order for the
measure to be consistent, should you want to measure performance for a number
of processes, including those of competitors. For a first attempt at this measure,




take the starting time as the point when the first order for materials is raised.
Consider the total time needed to make and deliver a new product or batch of
products. This includes the time needed to procure the longest lead parts and the
total manufacturing time. The end of the process is the time when you fulfil an
order and the product is received by the customer, rather than the time when you
dispatch it.
This measure incorporates the steps the customer takes to receive your delivery
and get it to where it is needed. Exploring this process will reveal useful opportu­
nities where you can help the customer to help themselves, thus strengthening
your competitive position.
D-tim e

The time for which customers are willing to wait to have their demand fulfilled is
the D -tim e or demand time. It is measured from when the person in the customer
company realises they have a need and the end point is when the product is
received by that person.
D-time varies considerably. For example, the time a customer is willing to wait
for 'fast food' is comparatively short. Assuming you are in a city with plenty of op­
tions, once you realise you are hungry, you probably will want to be eating within
10 minutes. This D-time will include the time it takes to walk to the cafeteria/
restaurant, wait in a queue, sit at a table and be served. By contrast, as a customer
of an up-market restaurant, you may have travelled for an hour, spent 20 minutes
in a reception area over an aperitif and studied the menu for 15 minutes, before
happily waiting for a further half an hour for the meal to be cooked and served.
In addition to the obvious differences in grade and choice of food, the implica­
tion from a supply chain point of view is that the two restaurants must be organ­
ised in totally different ways to deliver the food within their customers' D-time.
Interestingly, the same customer may visit both restaurants on the same day and
accept the two different delivery systems. You do not expect to wait at a fast-food
counter, but you do expect to linger over a meal in a high-quality restaurant.
Similar examples can be found in other industries. Buyers of new premium cars
expect to wait a m onth or two for delivery when they place an order. Some people
are not prepared to wait so long, but are prepared to accept a second choice of
colour instead of their first, especially if the dealer gives a discount! Manufactur­
ers of vehicles for customers with short D-times face increased supply chain chal­
lenges compared with those who have long ones. If it is not possible to make a car
to order within the expected D-time, then the manufacturer is forced to carry out
some or all of the logistics processes speculatively. The most risky scenario is to
make the whole car for stock, hoping that the forecast mix of diesel and petrol, of
left- and right-hand drive and so on is correct. But taking such a risk is necessary
to cope with the customer who wants to drive away a vehicle the same day he or
she enters the dealer's showroom.
It is worth pointing out the parallels in new product development. Some
new product development is a race to get new ideas and innovations to
market. However, others involve hitting specific customer-defined windows of
opportunity for getting products to market. This is particularly true for lowertier suppliers in supply chains. These two concepts have different objectives, as
shown in Table 5.1.

Suppose your customer announces their intention for the launch of their new
product. They usually give a number of deadlines to would-be suppliers, including:
• date for tenders;
• date for first-off samples;
• date for volume launch.
These are the D-times for each stage of product development. As a potential
supplier, you must be able to meet all of these windows. Indeed, each supplier
must be capable of meeting all of these deadlines for the product to meet its
launch date successfully.

5.2.3 Consequences when P-time is greater than D-time
P-time should be measured for each separate product group, because each will
have different internal processes. D-time should be measured for each different
market segment that is served, because customers may have different needs (e.g.
prepared to wait/not prepared to wait).
Armed with this data, P-times and D-times should be contrasted for each
product/customer group to see if P-time is more than D-time. A simple way to
do this is by drawing them on a graph as time lines, as shown in Figure 5.3.
The length of the arrows shown in Figure 5.3 represents time. The arrow for the
P-time represents the time taken for source, make and deliver processes. The
D-time arrow represents the time the customer is prepared to wait for an order
to be fulfilled.
Comparing the length of the two arrows, it can be seen that the time it takes
to respond to an order is longer than the customer is prepared to wait. Thus the
P-time is greater than D-time. The consequence is that this focal firm is not able
fully to make to order. On the other hand, it may be possible to complete the final
'make' processes such as assembly and test within the customer-required D-time.
Such a strategy is called assemble to order (ATO). This is basically how Dell m an­
ages to supply the computer you want so quickly.

The vertical broken line that separates D-time from P-D time in Figure 5.3 is
the customer order decoupling point (CODP): downstream from the point the focal

firm carries out processes to known customer orders, whereas upstream from this
point the processes are carried out speculatively. We return to the importance of
the CODP in terms of planning and controlling materials in Chapter 6.
We now consider a case study where time-based approaches are used to reduce
the time the customer waits for delivery of an industrial product, such that order
fulfilment lead time is closer to D-time.

Wiltshire Distribution Transformers
The managing director of Wiltshire Distribution Transformers (WDT), had concentrated
on a new generation of simplified, modular designs that used proven US technology. He
had energetically exploited the market advantages this had given. WDT now has two
major product ranges:
•
•

TR 100: 3-phase, oil-cooled transformers with a power rating from 200 to 2000 kVA;
PS 300: packaged substations that utilise TR 100 transformers with appropriate
switchgear and LV control panels.


Judging by the number of enquiries, the market for both product ranges was now
increasing.

The n ew JIT system
Each product must be individually engineered to order (ETO). Previously, this process
had taken tw o weeks, because an engineer had to develop an entirely new design from
scratch based on the customer order. Designs have now been modularised (refer to
Section 7.2.2) as a result of the new system: that is, a new design is produced from
a few hundred standard 'modules' that are held on file. This can be done by a sales
engineer in a matter of hours. If a tender was accepted by a customer, it had for­
merly taken another two weeks to convert the tender information into specifications
and drawings for manufacture. Today, it is possible simply to send the accepted tender
information to the shop floor, and to use the set of standard engineering information
already held on file to act as manufacturing instructions. The following is a list of the
main features of the new JIT system.

Enquiry processing
The engineer enters major design details (kVA rating, voltage ratio, product classifica­
tion and quantity) into a computerised estimating program. From a list of 700 possible
options, the selected ones to suit the tender requirements are added. From a library of
material, labour and overhead costs, a tender price is calculated.
Should the customer accept this price, then a customer delivery date is agreed and
the tender becomes the works (factory) order.

Engineering instructions
WDT's efforts had resulted in the completion of a comprehensive library of standard
drawings and instructions that covered all major options. The works order simply calls
these up by reference number and description. The one exception is the fabricated
cubicle that houses the packaged substations. This has to be individually designed.
A simple CAD/CAM system enables the design and associated manufacturing instruc­
tions to be completed quickly. Presentations of the panels can be separately worked on
and designed. The output is a set of computer numerical control (CNC) tapes for the
relevant machines in the fabrication shop, and a set-up schedule indicating sheet size,
clamp positions, list of tools, etc.

M aster production scheduling (M P S)
Activity durations for each manufacturing process vary according to specific designs,
and are picked up from the works order. Only bottleneck operations are scheduled, and
can be loaded only up to 100 per cent of their capacity. Given the customer requirement
date, the scheduling programme works backwards and loads activities to key resources
so that the final assembly date will be met. The MPS is executed by allowing demand to
be pulled through the manufacturing system (a process called pull scheduling).




Material requirements for each work centre for each order are calculated by means of
a modular bill of material, which has been simplified as a result of the modular designs.

Shop scheduling
The MPS generates operation release tickets (ORTs) for each scheduled process. The type
and quantity of units required by the next process are withdrawn from the previous one
as they are needed. When a work square becomes empty, an ORT is passed back to the
preceding work centre to trigger a manufacturing operation. This serves as a signal ( kan­
ban ) to the previous process to produce just enough units to replace those withdrawn.
Work is performed in sequence of ORTs, and is carried out only when an output
square is available. Completed operations are marked up on the hard copy of the MPS,
which is pinned to the wall of the works manager's office by the supervisors at the end
of each shift. The MPS is updated for completed operations and new orders each week.
A combination of four weeks' reduction in the time taken to tender and the time
taken to produce a manufacturing design, and a further tw o weeks' reduction in manu­
facturing times, has placed WDT in a pre-eminent position in the marketplace. Custom­
ers want to place orders for this type of equipment later and later in their own projects,
so short lead times are a major benefit to WDT in the marketplace.
Questions

1 Sketch out the main processes between a customer placing an enquiry and receiving
delivery of a WDT transformer. Where has WDT really scored in terms of reducing
this time?
2 What are the potential negatives of WDT's new JIT system in terms of lim iting cus­
tomer choice and short-circuiting the design process?

5.3 Time-based process mapping
Key issue: How do you go about measuring tim e in a supply network?

The purpose of supply chain mapping is to generate visibility of the processes
within the supply chain. Once this visibility has been achieved it is possible to
benchmark similar processes. The processes we need to map are the actual process­
es that are taking place, not what is supposed to happen. Quality standards based
on ISO 9000 require processes to be documented, but within the organisation
the actual process undertaken may often differ considerably. W hen undertaking
a supply chain mapping exercise it is the actual process that we need to focus on.
The key is to track one order, one product or one person through the process with
respect to time. A map is a snapshot taken during a given time period. Workloads
may vary during the course of a m onth, and so may the individual process times.
Record the actual times that you observe. Most processes take place in batches, so
if you are mapping a trailer being filled with tyres, record the time that the me­
dian (middle) tyre waits before being moved. The m ethod of documentation of
the process and the symbols to use are illustrated in Table 5.2.

Key operations and the subprocesses that can consume the most time and gen­
erate the greatest inefficiencies (e.g. waiting for transport) are revealed, enabling
problem solving and improvement of the supply chain.
The following sections give an overview of the key stages involved in the timebased mapping process.

5.3.1

Stage 1: Create a task force
Before the mapping process can be undertaken, it needs to be recognised that
supply chain processes cross all functions of the organisation. It is therefore im­
portant to have all key functions represented. The task force must be assured of
top m anagement support. A project champion may also need to be appointed.

5.3.2 Stage 2: Select the process to map
It may not be feasible to map the total supply chain initially. Take an overview of
the core processes w ithin the organisation and the time they take before deciding
on the priorities for detailed mapping. To get the organisation to 'buy in' to the
project, a subprocess may be identified that has been a particular problem. This
can act as a pilot for the task force, enabling them to prove that their methods
really work. W hen selecting the process, ensure that there is a generic customer
or group of customers that the process serves. A clear start (or trigger) and finish
to the process should also be present.




5.3.3 Stage 3: Collect data
The m ost effective way to collect the data is to follow an item through the
process. This is referred to often as walking the process. An actual com ponent
or order will be followed through all the stages of the process. Identify some­
one who is actively involved in each part of the process and knows w hat is
really happening w ithin the process: interview these key individuals. Get the
interviewee to describe each m ovem ent of the item w ith respect to time. It can
be useful to ask the interviewee to describe 'a day in the life of' that product
or order. Remember, the steps an item goes through are not just those where
som ething is done: for example, items could be waiting or being moved, or
may be sitting waiting for a decision to be made. Identify an appropriate level
of detail at which to map the process. Initially it m ight be better to map at a
high level to gain an overview of the process; one can always m ap in more
detail if needed later.

5.3.4 Stage 4: Flow chart the process
Use the data collected by walking the process and the interviews w ith opera­
tors to sketch a flow chart so linkages and dependencies between steps can
be clarified before constructing the time-based process map. This flow chart
is used by the task force to ensure they have n o t missed any steps in the
process.

5.3.5 Stage 5: Distinguish between value-adding
and non-value-adding time
A rough definition of value-adding time is time when something takes place on
the item that the end-customer is willing to pay for. The definition of value-adding
time requires due consultation, and should be aligned with the overall business
strategy. The business strategy should define the markets and segments, and the
accompanying order qualifiers and order winners (see Chapters 1 and 2). Once the
value-adding criteria at the strategic level have been defined, these can be trans­
lated into value-adding criteria at an operational level. The time data collected in
stage 3 can then be analysed to identify the value-adding time. Value-adding time
is characterised using three criteria:
• whether the process (or elements of the process) physically transforms the m a­
terial that forms the input to that process;
• whether the change to the item is something that the customer values or cares
about and is willing to pay for;
• whether the process is right the first time, and will not have to be repeated in
order to produce the desired result that is valued by the customer.
Non-value-adding activity can be split into four categories: delay, transport,
storage and inspection, using the categories from Table 5.2.


5.3.6 Stage 6: Construct the time-based process map
The purpose of the time-based process map is to represent the data collected
clearly and concisely so that the critical aspects of the supply network can be
communicated in an easily accessible way. The ultimate goal is to represent the
process on a single piece of paper so that the task force and others involved in
the project can easily see the issues. A simple Gantt chart technique can be used
to show the process, and different categories of non-value-adding time can be
represented on this. These categories will be dependent on the nature of each
process. Figure 5.4 shows three operations processes (delivery, production and
goods in), with the last one magnified to show four types of waste.

Figure 5.4

Process activity mapping and sources of waste

From the interviews and data from walking the process, extract the relevant data.
It is sometimes useful to sketch a flow diagram so that linkages and dependences
between steps can be clarified before constructing the map. This flow diagram can
be used to approximate the total time that the business process consumes.

5.3.7 Stage 7: Solution generation
Once the time-based process map has been produced, the opportunities for
improvement are generally all too obvious. The task force can collect ideas and
categorise causes of non-value-adding activity using problem-solving approaches
such as cause-and-effect diagrams. (A helpful condensed guide to problem-solv­
ing tools and techniques will be found in Bicheno and Holweg, 2008.)
The Electro-Coatings case study (Case study 5.2) describes how the above prin­
ciples were applied to a focal firm that produces electroplated parts for the auto­
motive industry.




CASE STUDY

5.2

Electro-Coatings Ltd
Electro-Coatings Ltd electroplates parts for the automotive industry, for example, the
marque badges fitted to the front of prestige cars. Customers were becoming increas­
ingly demanding, resulting in Electro-Coatings undertaking a review of its internal sup­
ply chain. The initial analysis by walking the process identified 12 key processes, as
shown in Figure 5.5.
Once this initial map was produced, each step was mapped in detail and some 60 steps
were identified. These steps were summarised as a flow diagram in Figure 5.6, showing
every process step.
An initial analysis of value-adding and non-value-adding time was undertaken. This
is shown in Table 5.3, which summarises the total time, wasted time and value-adding
time for each of the 12 steps. These data were then used to produce a map with the value-adding (activity) time and non-value-adding (wasted) time shown as the series of 11
steps (etch and plate were combined) against total elapsed time in hours (Figure 5.7).
The total process took approximately 70 hours. The project team held an after­
noon meeting with those involved in the process, and the results of this brainstorming

session produced the cause-and-effect diagram shown in Figure 5.8. This was then used
to identify opportunities for improving the process. For example, the analysis revealed
that jobs arriving inwards at 9.00 am m ight not be put into the system until 5.00 pm
because the operator would undertake the computer inputting in one go at the end

5.4 Managing timeliness in the logistics pipeline
Key issue: W hen P-time is greater than D-time, w hat time-based strategies and

practices can help to improve competitiveness?

Two basic strategies for managing timeliness in the logistics pipeline are make
to stock (MTS) and make to order (MTO). In between, we have assemble to order
(ATO). We begin with a brief description of each:
• Make to stock (MTS). Here, the key task is to offer products for customers to buy
from available inventory. Customer service is determined by this availability,
so a key performance measure in supermarkets is on-shelf availability (OSA).
Achieving 100 per cent OSA would m ean holding infinite inventories so, in
practice, a compromise of say 98.5 per cent OSA across most products at most
times is targeted. MTS firms have to plan the availability of their inventory by
means of a distribution network, which may involve several levels (regional,
national and local). In turn, this requires that models are determined for stock
replenishment - how much, when and where.
• Assemble to order (ATO). By shifting the decoupling point (CODP, Figure 5.3) up­
stream, it is possible to greatly reduce risk - of holding inventories of finished
products that do not sell, and of missing out on sales opportunities because the
desired product was unavailable at the time. Thus Dell computers and BMW
cars use ATO as their basic strategies. A BMW 3-series is available in around a
million finished vehicle specifications, and it would be risky and impractical
to have all of these available in the distribution pipeline. This means that the
vehicle must be designed flexibly in terms of components, options and modules.
• Make to order (MTO). Here, the CODP is moved to product design, thus reducing

the need for speculative processes even further. In the Wiltshire Distribution
Transformers case (Case study 5.1), we saw how a focal firm had moved from an
engineered to order (ETO) to a MTO strategy. It had achieved this by develop­
ing standard modular designs, which meant that customer orders could be con­
figured by the sales engineer, rather than having to be designed from scratch.
Let us now consider the strategies and practices that can be used to cope when
P-time is greater than D-time.

5.4.1

Strategies to cope when P-time is greater than D-time
W hen faced with a D-time shorter than the corresponding P-time, a company
has a num ber of options. In the short term it can attem pt to make to order, or it
can forecast demand and supply from stock (MTS). Making to order in these cir­
cumstances is likely to dissatisfy customers. If competitors exist that can deliver
within the customer's D-time, or there are substitute products available that will,
then the customer is likely to select them. If there are no alternatives, then it
may be possible to continue supplying to order for the short term. In the longer
term it is likely that the customer will seek to develop alternative suppliers, or
re-engineer its products to remove the need for yours.


The more common solution is to forecast customer demand, make products
to stock and supply from there. This stock may be held as finished goods if the
D-time is very short, or it could be work-in-progress held in the manufacturing
process that can be finished in time. This option incurs a num ber of penalties.
The stocks of goods will need to be financed, as will the space needed to store
them. There is also the risk that the customer may not order those goods already
made within their shelf-life, causing them to become obsolete.
Both make to order and make to stock have associated costs and risks, so a
company should look at ways to reduce these costs and risks in the longer term.
Reducing risks can be grouped into three inter-linked areas. These are marketing,
product development and process improvement. Each of these areas is analysed
below.
M arketing

There are various ways in which you could reduce risk, with customer help. For
example, ask the customer to cooperate by supplying more detailed demand infor­
mation at an earlier stage. Speed up the access to demand data, perhaps by locat­
ing one of your people in the customer's scheduling process. Perhaps the customer
is prepared to wait longer than stated, if you can guarantee delivery on time.
Product development

There are only so m any improvements to the reduction of production time that
can be made when a process is based around existing products. With time-based
thinking in mind, next-generation products can be designed for 'time to market’.
Such thinking aims for products that can be made and distributed quickly, and
that offer product variety without unnecessary complexity.
Process improvement

Time-based organisations come into their own by changing the way they go about
their business. They engineer their processes to eliminate unnecessary steps, and
take wasted time out of those that remain. Engineering your key processes means
focusing on those things the customer cares about and getting rid of all the rest.
Having done this once, the best organisations go on to do it again and again as they
learn more about their customers and grow in confidence in what they can change.

5.4.2 Practices to cope when P-time is greater than D-time
There are a num ber of ways to reduce P-time. These can be summarised as follows:
• Control by optimising throughput and improving process capability.
• Simplify by untangling process flows and reducing product complexity
• Compress by straightening process flows and reducing batch sizes.
• Integrate by improving communications and implementing teams.
• Coordinate by adding customer-specific parts as late as possible.
• Autom ate with robots and IT systems.




Control

In any process, lead time depends on the balance between load and capacity. If
demand rises above available capacity, lead times will increase unless resource is
also increased, for example through overtime or subcontracting work. Therefore,
in order to m aintain or reduce lead time, it is necessary to balance this equation
effectively by optimising throughput. Similarly, if a process is out of control, and
we are never sure whether a conforming product will be produced, the focus will
be on improving the capability of that process.
Simplify

Simplification is concerned with cutting out sources of process complexity and of
product complexity. Process complexity is caused often by m any different prod­
ucts sharing the same process. This process becomes a bottleneck, and process flows
become tangled because they all have to go through this single, central process.
In manufacturing, the solutions are based on cellular manufacturing: in distribu­
tion, the solutions are based on different distribution channels. Product complex­
ity is often related to the number o f parts. The more parts there are in a product
the more difficult it is to plan, to make and to sell. One way to reduce prod­
uct complexity is to reduce the num ber of parts, by integrating several compo­
nents into one. The other is to reduce the num ber of parts by standardising them
between products.
Compress

Compressing P-time is concerned with squeezing out waste in each process step.
There are two m ain ways to achieve this. First, straighten the process flow by
making a linear flow for each product. Second, reduce the batch size so that flow
is improved and queuing time is minimised.
Integrate

Integrating different value-adding activities so that they work more closely
together helps to reduce P-time. Integration is, in turn, helped by improving the
speed and accuracy of information to the process owner. Important issues are
demand information (what to do next?), product information (what is it?) and
process information (how is it done?). Ways of speeding up information range
from simple, paperless systems such as kanban, through simple IT systems such as
email, to more complex systems such as making EPOS data available in real time
through the internet. Integration is also helped by forging relationships between
departments or organisations that need to communicate. Teams and partnerships
help to integrate activities that are otherwise disconnected.
Coordinate

Other approaches to reducing P-time aim to reorganise value-adding activities so
that they are done in parallel and/or in the best order. Thus running activities at
the same time (in parallel) instead of one after another (in series) will reduce lead
times. Sometimes it is possible to reduce lead times by doing the same activities in


a different order. This may make it possible to combine activities or allow them to
be done in parallel. It may also make better use of resources by fitting an extra job
into a shift, or by running long tasks that need no supervision overnight.
Autom ate

This approach should be used last, once all the others have delivered their
improvements (do not automate waste!). Chiefly it is concerned with reducing
lead time through the use of robots and IT systems to speed up processes. Such
approaches are best focused on bottleneck steps in the overall process. The aim is
to improve process capability and reliability as well as speed.

5.5 When, where and how?
There are several tactical considerations to be made when planning a time-based
strategy. We have grouped these in the form of three questions to be asked:
• When? Time-based competition is only as relevant as the customer perceives
it to be. Speed for the sake of speed can create unnecessary costs, and can cut
corners, leading to poor quality.
• Where? D-times are a measure of the importance of speed as a competitive fac­
tor, whilst P-times measure the ability to deliver. The integration of the two
measures the point at which the customer order penetrates the supply chain.
In Chapter 5 and Chapter 6, we develop this issue in terms of the customer
order decoupling point.
• How? The more predictable and lower-priority products and components can
be delivered from inventory with less priority given to speed. Shipments of
cu sto m ise d p rod ucts ca n b e a ssem b led from stocks o f standard c o m p o n e n ts

and modules within the D-time demanded.

Summary
W h a t is the lead-tim e frontier?

• Competing on time demands a fast response to customer needs. Time-based ap­
proaches to strategy focus on the competitive advantage of speed, which helps
a network to cope with variety and product innovation, whilst also improving
returns on new products. Speed also means less reliance on long-term forecasts.
• Speed of response helps to lower costs by reducing the need for working capi­
tal, and plant and equipment. It also helps to reduce development costs and
the cost of quality.
• The lead-time frontier is concerned with reducing P-time (time needed to pro­
duce a product or service) to less than D-time (time for which the customer is
prepared to wait).




• Differences between P-times and D-times are referred to as the lead-time gap.
The gap has strategic implications for marketing, product development and
process development. P-time can be reduced by a six-stage process: control,
simplify, compress, integrate, coordinate and automate.
H o w do we measure a n d im plem ent time-based strategies?

• Time-based mapping aims to generate visibility of time in the supply network. A

seven-step approach to mapping involves creating a task force, selecting the pro­
cess, collecting data, distinguishing between value-adding and non-value-adding
activities, constructing the time-based process map and generating a solution.

Discussion questions
1 Why is time important to competitive advantage? Identify and explain six key
contributions that speed can make to logistics strategy.
2 'Variety yes, complexity no'. Discuss the implications of this statement to logistics
strategy.
3 Explain the significance of P:D ratios. How can the production lead time be reduced?

CHAPTER 6

Supply chain planning and control

Objectives

The intended objectives o f this chapter are to:

•

explain the processes by which material flow is planned and executed
within a focal firm and between partners in a supply chain;

•

describe the principles of just-in-time and its implications for logistics;

•

explain how just-in-time can be applied in combination w ith material
requirement planning;

•

explain the initiatives that have been developed to overcome poor
coordination in retail supply chains.

By the end o f this chapter you should be able to:

•

appreciate the sophistication that lies behind an integrated model of
material flow in a supply chain, and why this model is so easily corrupted;

•

understand how corruption of flow causes loss of focus on ability to meet
end-customer demand;

•

understand just-in-time pull scheduling where parts are pulled through
the chain in response to demand from the end-customer;

•

recognise enemies of flow in the supply chain;

•

appreciate initiatives that have been developed to restore flow.

Introduction
In Chapter 3, we introduced the simple framework for coordinated processes
across the supply chain that has become known as the 'SCOR model' (Figure 3.18).
This model creates a vision of integration of supply chain processes both up­
stream and downstream. A shared planning process - that coordinates move­
ments seamlessly from one process to the next - orchestrates material flow.
The reality of supply chain management today - summarised in our paper on
theory, practice and future challenges (Storey, et al., 2006) - shows a very different
picture: 'Few practitioners were able - or even seriously aspired - to extend their
reach across the supply chain in the m anner prescribed in much modern theory.'
The factors behind the gap between vision and reality are many, reflecting the
sophisticated web of processes and coordination that lie behind the vision and




the almost endless ways of corrupting it. UK retailer Marks & Spencer (M&S) intro­
duced vendor managed inventory (VMI - described in Section 6.3.3) to its cloth­
ing range, and achieved high levels of coordination with its tier 1 suppliers, low
costs and high on-shelf availability. However, events unravelled after a few years
due to a number of factors (Storey, et al., 2005). Two of the major factors were:
• A change in m anagement structure, as M&S created a new category team,
m any of whom did not like the idea of sharing sales data with suppliers. The
m ethod used to generate sales data was changed, and resulted in loss of access
to the flow of sales data on which the VMI system depended.
• Suppliers began to outsource their production to new factories in Southeast
Asia and Morocco to reduce costs, but this resulted in six-week replenishment
cycles and loss of responsiveness. Complementary sets of clothes were sourced
to different countries, and it proved hard to coordinate deliveries.
Decisions based on advantages internal to a focal firm, and on the search for
cheaper prices, are but two common factors in corrupting the flow of materi­
als and information and the focus on the end-customer. Corruption is displayed
by poor customer service, stock write-offs or mark-downs, and a lot of resource
devoted to 'fire fighting'.
This chapter aims to summarise the detail of an integrated planning and con­
trol system. The most comprehensive models originate from manufacturing, and
link key activities such as resource planning, demand management and capacity
planning into a holistic framework. Individual firms have been quite successful
not only in developing effective manufacturing planning and control (MPC) sys­
tems, but also in integrating them with other business functions such as finance
and hum an resources through enterprise resource planning (ERP). However, link­
ages between the MPC systems of supply chain partners are relatively weak (Vollman, et al., 2005: 578). And linkages between MPC systems at manufacturers and
'service' processes such as distribution and back of store are even weaker. Skim the
detail at your peril! Far too many logistics 'decisions' are made on the basis of lack
of understanding of the sheer scale and scope of the intricacies of balancing load
and capacity, of coordinating marketing wants and supply chain realities.
Next we move to the just-in-time approach to controlling material flow such
that product is pulled through the supply chain in response to customer demand.
In Chapter 5, we reviewed the importance of time in supply chain thinking. Time
is one of the 'hard objectives' (Section 1.3.1), and some supply chains compete on
time by delivering products to the end-customer faster than competition. Here,
the focus is on reducing the time taken for each process. But time can also be used
to alter the trade-offs between competitive priorities - for example, costs do not
have to rise proportionately as lead times are reduced (Section 5.1.1). This can be
achieved by squeezing non-value-adding activities (delays, transport, storage and
inspection) from the supply chain by time-based process mapping (Section 5.3).
Such activities are referred to generically as waste, the Japanese word for which is
muda (the concept of waste was introduced in Chapter 5 and is explored further
in Chapter 7, Section 7.1.1). Such thinking has been developed into a philosophy
and accompanying tools and techniques, initially under the banner of 'just-intim e' (JIT). The aim of JIT (Harrison, 1992) is:


To m eet dem and instantaneously w ith perfect quality and n o waste.

All three targets (meeting demand instantaneously; perfect quality; no waste)
are ideals that can never be achieved fully. But we can get closer to them over time
through continuous improvement.
Finally, we examine the planning and control processes in retail, and explain
the implications for integrating material flow across the supply chain. Retail sup­
ply chains are of particular interest because end-customer demand is tracked con­
tinuously through POS data. There should, accordingly, be every opportunity to
develop a seamless coordination between demand and supply, as envisaged in
Figure 1.7. There are challenges enough to cope with, notably the integration of
manufacturing, distribution and service processes. However - historically at least retailers have given priority to the market and have expected manufacturers to
keep pace without investing much in terms of coordinating demand and supply.
This has resulted in such problems as amplification of demand upstream - the socalled 'bullwhip effect' - high inventories and lengthy P-times. The second part
of this chapter therefore continues by reviewing some of the key initiatives that
have been developed in recent years to improve planning and control of materi­
als in retail supply chains.

Key issues

This chapter addresses three key issues as follows:
1 The supply chain 'game plan': planning and control in m anufacturing. M anaging
independent demand items. Retail supply chains - driven by the m arket rather than
by the supply chain. Implications fo r supply chain planning and control.
2 Just-in-time (JIT) scheduling: the implications of just-in-tim e fo r logistics and how
just-in-tim e principles can be applied to other forms of material control such as
material requirements planning (MRP).
3 Overcoming poor coordination in retail supply chains: initiatives to improve
coordination in retail supply chains. Efficient consumer response (ECR). Collabora­
tive planning, forecasting and replenishment (CPFR). Vendor managed inventory
(VMI). Quick response (QR).

6.1 The supply chain 'game plan'
Key issues: W hat are the key steps in planning and executing material flow and

information flow within the focal firm? W hat are the key steps in planning and
executing material flow and information flow between partners in a supply net­
work? W hat are the implications for planning and controlling the supply chain
as a whole?

In this section, we consider planning and control processes across a simple sup­
ply chain, such as that shown in Figure 1.1. We start with planning and control
processes at the manufacturer, and the demands this generates on the supplier
(well documented in such publications as Vollman, et al., 2005). Once it has
been made, a fresh batch of product turns into finished product inventory - initially
stored in the manufacturer's national distribution centre (NDC). So, next we turn




to the m anagement of inventory in the supply chain, showing that different m od­
els are likely to be used by manufacturers and retailers to determine how much
and when to order. We then explain planning and control from the retailer's
perspective, and conclude with the implications for planning and controlling the
supply chain as a whole.

6.1.1

Planning and control within manufacturing
The purpose of a manufacturing planning and control (MPC) system is to meet
customer requirements by enabling managers to make the right decisions. The
system coordinates information on key 'source-make-deliver' processes to enable
material to flow efficiently and effectively. Three time horizons are involved for
all of these processes:
• Long term-, to support decisions about capacity provision. These decisions are
essentially strategic, and answer the questions how much capacity is needed,
when and of what type? Thus Mercedes-Benz may plan new model ranges for
20 years ahead - including outline volumes, internal and supplier capacities
and distribution strategies.
• Medium term: to match supply and demand. Here, Mercedes may plan in more
detail over the next 12 m onths to ensure that forecast demand can be met by
correct material provision, together with capacity and resource (such as m an­
power) availability. The plan would be refreshed monthly.
• Short term: to meet day-to-day demand as it unfolds. Here, Mercedes makes
weekly production plans to meet specific customer orders. There may be
numerous changes that affect achievement of the medium-term plan. These
include changes in customer demand, facility problems and supplier short­
ages. The short-term plan helps managers to decide what corrective actions are
needed to resolve such problems, and would be refreshed daily or weekly.
Figure 6.1 shows the main modules in an MPC system. The top section is called
the 'front end', and provides an overall m atch of demand and resource. We sum­
marise here the m ain front-end modules, followed by a summary of engine and
back end:
• D em and management: collates demand from all sources - external (forecasts
and orders), internal (other firms within the organisation) and spares. Such
demand is called independent - that is, it is independent of the actions of the
focal firm. Referring to Figure 5.3, dem and is independent up to the customer
order decoupling point (CODP). At this point, dem and changes from inde­
pendent to dependent. Upstream from the CODP, in the area referred to as
'P-time-D-time', the focal firm assumes responsibility for sourcing and mak­
ing speculatively - on the assumption that orders eventually will transpire.
Thus make to order (MTO, Section 5.4) incurs less speculation than assemble
to order (ATO) and much less than make to stock (MTS). Speculation implies
that it is necessary to forecast dem and for the relevant module. Thus, fore­
casting for sales and operations planning is carried out m onthly or quarterly
and is at the level of the overall product line. Forecasts for master production

scheduling purposes are refreshed frequently for the next few days or weeks,
and are made at the level of the individual SKU (stock keeping unit). Short­
term projective forecasting (Section 2.3) is carried out using techniques such
as moving averages and exponential smoothing, which are described in Vollman,
et al. (2005: 32). Forecast accuracy (comparing forecast and actual values) is
measured by such techniques as mean average deviation (MAD, Section 2.3).
It is necessary to forecast only for independent dem and items: dem and for
dependent items can be calculated using material requirements planning described below.
• Resource planning: pooling demand and passing it on to manufacturing m ust be
moderated by capacity to deliver. Otherwise, a focal firm is at risk of being u n ­
able to fulfil marketing plans that do not take into account the realities of what
can be done. Again, this would mean that marketing plans are not actionable
(Section 2.2). Resource planning is concerned with manufacturing capacity in
the longer term (output measure), and with machine and manpower loading
(input measure) in the shorter term.
• Sales and operations planning (S&OP): is the module concerned with matching
of demand management and resource planning. Therefore, it is crucial that
compatible measures of demand and capacity are used - for example, tonnes/
week or '000 units produced/week. Sales and marketing must check with m an­
ufacturing that new enquiries can be made and delivered within requested
lead times. This may well require coordination across several manufacturing
units in different countries. The aim of S&OP is to maintain balance between




demand and supply. Create too much demand in terms of capacity, and m anu­
facturing will be under pressure to work overtime and to rush work through. If
there is too little demand, margins will be under pressure from under-utilised re­
sources, layoffs and price cuts. S&OP is discussed in more detail in section 7.2.1.
• M aster production scheduling (MPS): is the disaggregated form of the S&OP.
This means th at the S&OP is broken down from high level measures
like product families into the detail of SKUs by major production facility.
The MPS is the link between front end and engine of the MPC system. On
the one hand, it receives S&OP data about sales and forecasts. On the other
hand, it feeds data back to S&OP on orders and stock replenishm ent status
so that customers and distribution can be kept up to date. The MPS handles
the detail of w hat is planned and w hat is happening. For MTS environ­
m ents, the priority is inventory m anagem ent: for MTO environm ents, the
priority is tim ely execution of all of the processes from design through to
delivery.
• Material and capacity planning (engine room): from overall demand by SKU it is
next necessary to develop detailed plans by part number. For each part and
subassembly, detailed plans show how many and when each must be made.
Like the ‘big picture' front end logic, not only must a detailed material plan be
devised, but it must also be moderated by capacity availability (resources) in
each production centre. The logic behind this is called material requirements
planning (MRP). This takes MPS data, and explodes it into detailed plans by com­
ponent and subassembly. Each of these plans must be checked and optimised
against available capacity by means of the detailed capacity planning m od­
ule. An impression of what is involved is given in Victoria SA, Case study 6.1.
Engine room logic is described in the form of a novel by Goldratt and Cox
(1984); further details are in Vollman, et al. (2005).

CASE STUDY

6.1

Victoria SA
Victoria SA makes 'fantastically good cakes' from basic ingredients such as flour, eggs
and butter. Demand for Victoria sponge cakes comes from two sources. Some big retail­
ers place their order with the firm tw o days in advance, whilst other customers arrive
at Victoria's own shops w ithout prior warning and select from cakes that are on dis­
play. This means that some cakes are made in line w ith orders, whilst a forecast is also
required to predict day-to-day demand.
Whilst there are many varieties of cake, the bill of material for the famous Victoria
sponge cake is shown in Figure 6.2.
When overall demand across the range has been collated, Victoria SA is able to deter­
mine how much of each ingredient will be needed to make the right number of cakes.
Too many and cakes will have to be thrown away, because the shelf life is five to eight
days (Victoria does not use stabilisers such as potassium sorbate). Too few and sales
will be lost. Accurate planning is thus crucial to the efficiency of the whole operation.
The ideal situation is that cakes are made and delivered just-in-time to meet customer
demand because inventories will be low and freshness at its best.



Figure 6.2

Structured bill of materials for sponge cake

In an effort to increase sales, Victoria SA decided to increase the product range. Straw­
berry jam is the traditional filling, but marketing considers that customers would also
like other types of filling and decides to try blackberry jam, apricot jam, lemon curd
and chocolate. Over the course of the next few months, the experiment appears to be
working. Overall sales are up by 10 per cent, with each of the new varieties contribut­
ing well. The problem, however, is that no stable pattern exists in the mix of sales. For
example, some days the chocolate-filled cakes sell out, whilst on other days hardly a
single chocolate-filled cake is sold. Major retail customers are complaining about wast­
age and lost sales opportunities.
The issue appears to be that offering increased variety has led to less stability in the
demand pattern, as illustrated by the master production schedule (MPS) in Table 6.1.
Whilst total daily cake demand is reasonably stable, at around 200 cakes, the demand
for each variant is highly uncertain. This leads to high inventory levels, due to inaccurate
sales forecasts, and increased complexity in the production operation, as shown by the
MRP calculation for gross and net requirements in Table 6.2.

Table 6.2

Gross and net requirement calculations for one week demand for
sponge cake (before postponement). 'Exploding' is indicated by arrows

*BOM = bill of material (quantity required for each cake)

The MRP calculations, which are shown for the same one-week period as the MPS,
can be explained as follows:
1 Gross requirement for total finished cakes, and each cake variant, is taken from the
MPS.
2 Net requirement of cakes is calculated by subtracting the existing inventory from the
gross requirement.
3 Inventory of finished cakes is high (equivalent to almost four days' demand) because
demand for each variant is highly uncertain and therefore sales forecasts are inaccurate.
4 The net requirement for total finished cakes is exploded (by multiplying it by the
BOM quantity for each cake mix ingredient plus icing) to give the gross requirement
for each of the cake mix ingredients and the icing.
5 The net requirement for each of the cake ingredients is calculated by subtracting the
existing inventory and any scheduled receipts.
6 The inventory of cake mix ingredients is low (equivalent to about one day's
demand w ith another day's demand scheduled for receipt). This is a result of the


relatively stable demand for the total number of cakes leading to accurate sales
forecasts.
7 The net requirement for each of the finished cake variants is exploded (by multiplying
it by the BOM quantity for jam) to give the gross requirement for each jam flavour.
The net requirement of jam is calculated in the same way as for cake mix ingredients
(point 5 above).
8 Inventories of the various jams are high (they cover requirements for the coming
weeks w ithout need for scheduled receipts), and therefore the net requirement is
zero. This is due to inaccurate sales forecasts caused by the uncertain demand for
each cake variant.
To fix the unexpected problems, Victoria SA decided on a new way of working. It is
recognised that demand is not going to stabilise, given the increased product range.
The firm decided to adopt a postponement strategy by making standard cakes and
then postponing final assembly until known demand is available. The basic cake is
a standard component, whilst the filling is non-standard and represents the source of
complexity and variable customer demand. Cakes are therefore kept in the standard
form and turned into the final form only by adding the filling once customer orders
have been received. Victoria SA applied postponement to the supply chain and in­
troduced a decoupling point (Section 5.2.3) at the end of the cake making process.
Upstream of the decoupling point, overall demand is forecasted to inform sourc­
ing decisions. Standard components are baked each morning. Downstream of the
decoupling point, cakes are assembled to order (Section 5.4) in line w ith customer
orders. The tim e this activity takes has been minimised by setting up a workstation
w ith cakes, filling and spreading tools arranged in a mini flow-line. This brings the
production tim e (P-time: see Section 5.2) w ithin the tim e the customer is prepared to
wait (D-time). Carrying out the operation in view of the customer also helps engage
them and extends their D-time to a minute or so, long enough to complete the final
assembly task.
The flexibility of the new operation means that customers no longer need to place an
order two days in advance. Victoria SA can now supply from the new process if orders
are received by major customers the day before. An unexpected benefit of the new ap­
proach is the ease with which innovations can be test marketed and adopted.

Question

1 How do you think the MPS, the MRP gross/net requirements calculations and the
inventories (finished cake and ingredients) m ight be different after the implementa­
tion of postponement?

• MPC execution systems (back end): the outputs from material and capacity plans
in the engine are sets of instructions to suppliers, manufacturing and distri­
bution. These schedules are in the form of purchase orders, works orders (or
schedules for MTS) and shipping orders - hence the familiar 'source-make-deliver' processes at the bottom of Figure 6.1. The basic format is 'how many'




and 'when' for each part num ber for each planning process for the relevant
planning period (for example the next two weeks, or the next four weeks).
Achievement against schedule has to be monitored by minute, by hour or by
day. Failures to meet schedule - as a result of, for example, breakdowns or qual­
ity problems - require that remedial action is taken, such as overtime working
or outsourcing. An example here is the Procter & Gamble supply problem de­
scribed in Case study 1.4.
Front end, engine and back end MPC modules are all connected to the enterprise
resource planning (ERP) database. This enables MPC modules to be connected seam­
lessly to hum an resource management, finance and sales and marketing modules.
SAP includes MPC systems as part of its supply chain software - supply chain plan­
ning, execution, collaboration and coordination.

6.1.2 Managing inventory in the supply chain
Planning and controlling factory output is but part of the challenge of manag­
ing material flow in the supply chain. A focal firm positioned in a network, such
as that shown in Figure 1.2, is at the centre of many possible connections with
other supplier and customer companies. Upstream processes, such as distribution
and retail for both finished products and spare parts, are subject to independent,
random demand. Such demand is independent in that it is not affected by the
actions of the focal firm (although demand may of course be stimulated through
promotions). Dependent demand, on the other hand, is fixed by the actions of
the firm - such as order acceptance and determining forecasts. This section is con­
cerned with the management of inventories of independent demand items using
order point methods. These are aimed at optimising the trade-off between inven­
tory holding costs and the preparation costs of changeover (manufacturing) or of
placing an order (retailing and manufacturing). Whilst the concept of 'economic'
batch sizes and order sizes has been superseded widely by other considerations, as
we shall see, its principles help us to grasp the nature of some of the hidden costs
of inventory decisions.
'Economic' batch sizes an d order sizes

The question of how many parts to make at a time traditionally has been
answered by reference to a longstanding concept called the 'economic' batch
quantity (EBQ) formula. Similar principles are used to determine how m any parts
at a time to order from suppliers in 'economic' order quantities (EOQs). Both EBQ
and EOQ assume that parts are used at a uniform rate (i.e. that demand is stable),
and that another batch of parts should be made or ordered when stock falls below
the re-order point. The principle behind re-order point, which sets out to answer
the question when to order, is shown in Figure 6.3.
A buffer (or safety) stock line is shown below the re-order level. Buffer stock
acts as a 'safety net' in order to cushion the effects of variability in dem and and
lead times. Buffer stock is a function of the service level (risk of stock-outs),
lead tim e variability and dem and variability. The re-order point is therefore



Notes:

1 Re-order point = Demand during lead tim e + safety stock
2 Re-order quantity = Economic order quantity
3 Buffer stock = f (service level.lead tim e variability.demand variability)

Figure 6.3

When: the re-order point

the sum of the forecast dem and during the lead time plus the buffer stock
requirement. There are various ways of calculating buffer stock (for a detailed
coverage, and for details of EBQ and EOQ calculations, see Vollman, et al. 2005;
Waters, 2003).
In the case of manufacturing batch sizes, the EBQ is determined by optimis­
ing the trade-off between changeover cost between one batch and the next (for
example, cleaning out the process plant between one type of cheese and the
next, or resetting the packing line from 250g to 500g carton sizes) and inventory
carrying cost:
• C h a n g eo ver c o s t p e r u n it, Cs. T h e co st associated w ith c h a n g in g ov er a g iv e n
m a c h in e from th e last g o o d part from a b atch to th e first g o o d part from th e
su cc ee d in g b atch.

• Inventory carrying cost, C. The cost of holding stock, calculated from the total
inventory cost and the annual rate charged for holding inventory.
To these assumptions we need to add that the usage rate, z, is known and con­
stant and that the manufactured cost of the SKU, c, is also known and constant. A
little algebra applied to these assumptions leads to the so-called Wilson formula:
EBQ = 2zCs/cC

Thus EBQ increases with usage rate and changeover cost, and reduces with m an­
ufactured cost per unit and inventory carrying cost. Figure 6.4 shows how change­
over costs reduce as the batch size increases: the bigger the batch size, the lower the
changeover costs per unit. On the other hand, inventory carrying costs increase
linearly with batch size: the bigger the batch size, the bigger the carrying costs. A
total cost line can be added, which is at a minimum when the two lines cross.
All too often overlooked when calculating the EBQ is that the higher the
changeover cost, the higher the EBQ. The key point here is that the EBQ can





Figure 6.4

Economic batch quantity (EBQ)

therefore be reduced when the changeover cost is reduced. In the ideal case, the
changeover activity should be simplified so that it can be carried out in seconds
rather than in hours. Where this is achieved, the changeover cost becomes negli­
gible and the EBQ becomes one (Figure 6.5).
Given zero changeover costs, the EBQ formula obeys the JIT ideal of pull sched­
uling - only make in response to actual demand (as we shall see in Section 6.2).
Actual demand, of course, is likely to vary from one day to the next, unlike the
assumption for demand rate shown in Figures 6.3 and 6.4. Pull scheduling is
more sensitive to demand changes, because only what is needed is made. Note
that annual costs and demand have been quoted in Figures 6.4 and 6.5, but under
current market turbulence, this is unrealistic and much shorter history periods
(perhaps two or three months) should be used. A further major problem with use
of EBQs in manufacturing is that it leads to different stockholdings for different
part numbers. Synchronisation of parts movements becomes impossible.
The concept of the economic order quantity (EOQ) is based on similar assump­
tions to the EBQ. Here, the calculation addresses the question 'how many parts
will we order?' The trade-off this time is between the cost of placing an order and
inventory carrying cost, where:
• Cost o f placing an order: All order-related costs, including purchase department
costs, transportation costs from the supplier, and goods-in inspection and
receiving.



Figure 6.5

As EBQ becomes one

EOQ again increases in line with the cost of placing an order, and reduces in
line with the inventory carrying cost. Again the trade-off can be changed. If the
cost of placing an order can be simplified to a routine basis whereby parts are or­
dered by paperless systems such as cards, and collected on regular pick-up routes
called 'milk rounds', the EOQ again can be reduced towards the JIT ideal. In retail­
ing, similar economies can be made by using POS systems and centralised (as op­
posed to stores-based) ordering. EOQ principles are still widely used for ordering
'independent dem and' items that are not directly used to manufacture products,
such as automotive spare parts, class 'C' parts in retail and office supplies.
Periodic order quantity a n d target stock levels

Various methods have been adopted to overcome some of the deficiencies of EOQ
models, which mean that a set order size is placed on a supplier whenever the
inventory level falls below the re-order level. The effect upon suppliers is that,
although a regular am ount is ordered, the time the order is placed can vary enor­
mously. An EOQ system finds it very difficult to cope if demand goes up or down
rapidly. If demand goes up rapidly, then an EOQ system would tend to make
replenishments that lag the demand trend.
To illustrate, let us assume a sequence of 10 weeks where demand fluctuates
between 100 and 1,000 units. The economic order quantity (EOQ) has been
established as 1,000 units, and the safety stock at 100 units. Inventories at the
start and end of each week can then be calculated as shown in Table 6.3.

An alternative way to deal with variable demand is to use the periodic order
quantity. Here, the re-order quantities are revised more frequently. The method
uses mean time between orders (TBO), which is calculated by dividing the EOQ
by the average demand rate. In the above example, the EOQ is 1,000 and the
average demand 410. The economic time interval is therefore approximately 2.

terms of demand changes and safety stock level. However, the re-order quantity
is based on total demand for the immediate two weeks of history. This re-order
m ethod is called periodic order quantity (POQ).
POQ normally gives a lower mean inventory level than EOQ in variable
demand situations. In this example, the average inventory holding has fallen
from 5,150 to 4,150. The same number of orders (Chase et al., 2005) have been
used, but the order quantity varies from 200 to 1,800.
Periodic review

A widely used model for inventory control in retailing is periodic review. This
works by placing orders of variable size at regular intervals - the review period. The
quantity ordered is enough to raise stock on hand plus stock on order to a target
level called the target stock level (TSL):
Order quantity = Target stock level - Stock on hand - Stock on order

The TSL is the sum of cycle stock (average daily demand over the review period
and replenishment lead time) and the safety stock. An example of the way the
TSL is calculated is:
TSL = cycle stock - safety stock
= D*(T + LT) + Z*cr*
(T + LT)

where D = average daily demand per SKU, T = review period in days and LT =
lead time in days. Z = number of standard deviations from the mean correspond­
ing to the selected service level, and σ = standard deviation of demand over T
+ LT. D may be raised to weekly intervals for slow moving items, and lowered to
hours for fast movers.

6.1.3 Planning and control in retailing
Retailing is faced with planning and control challenges that are quite distinct
from manufacturing:
• A retailer cannot generate sales without stock, and stock that is bought for sales
that do not happen 'constitutes a retailer's nightmare' (Varley, 2006). Retailers
are constantly walking the tightrope between too much stock and not enough.
• The product range that has to be supported on the shelf is comparatively wide 20,000 different products in the Tesco example in Case study 1.1, and perhaps
four times that number of individual SKUs. On-shelf availability (OSA) is a key
performance indicator. The aim is that OSA targets are maintained across all
SKUs at all times of the day and night so that every product is available at any
time that a customer visits a store. In practice, categories such as fresh fish and
bread are withdrawn from sale by 18:00 hours to avoid excessive stock write­
offs when demand is comparatively low.
• Several stages of the internal supply chain must be coordinated - depots, back of
store and front of store. Again, it matters less if a product is in stock at the depot it does matter that it is on the shelf, without which sales cannot be generated.




• Retail profit margins in grocery are tighter (2-4 per cent) than for large, branded
manufacturers (8-10 per cent). Retail margins are prone to erosion by shrinkage,
which is caused by losses resulting from internal and external theft and process
failures such as damage and stocktaking errors. Average shrinkage in grocery
is 1.52 per cent (Chapman, 2010), and is much higher for categories such as
health and beauty, pharmaceutical and floral.
• Demand can be affected by changes that are difficult to forecast, such as sea­
sonality (Section 2.3), fashion, endorsements (such as the impact of a famous
TV chef on the sale of brown eggs) and promotions (Case study 2.2).
• 'Best before' and 'use by' dates for fresh produce increase obsolescence pres­
sures and inventory turns.
• Reverse logistics (Section 4.6) is more complicated because product is being
reversed from one point (the store) to a m ultitude of supply chains (suppliers).
As we have seen in Chapter 2, customers' choices in retailing 'drive everything'.
Retailers become more connected to the market than to the supply chain. The
core capability in retailing is trading - buying and selling goods at a profit. To a
degree, manufacturing suppliers become the means to an end, and the constraints
of manufacturing are poorly understood by retailers. We expect the manufactur­
ers to supply what we want when we say we want it. This ignores the S&OP dis­
cipline.
Consider the demand series shown in Figure 6.6. This is for a high volume
ambient product - in this case a washing powder for which demand is compara­
tively stable.
Examination of this very typical retail demand series shows that the overall
demand pattern for each week is similar, but is by no means identical. Peak de­
m and is usually (but not always) on a Saturday, whilst lowest demand is on Sun­
days when trading hours are restricted. There is a degree of uncertainty (Section
2.3) about the actual demand for each day. Retailers expect suppliers to cope with
this demand uncertainty - and other uncertainties in the supply chain caused
by problems such as shrinkage and variable transport times - by holding buffer
stocks. Case study 8.7 shows that these buffer stocks - often duplicated in the
retailer's depots - can be equivalent to several days of demand.

Figure 6.6

EPOS data for the last five weeks


How does the manufacturer cope with such retailer expectations? Washing
powders are manufactured in Europe at Procter & Gamble's (P&G's) factory near
London. The process involves mixing the ingredients of individual products
(such as Ariel and Bold) in batches and then drying and granulating each batch
into powder in a 'blowing tower'. Whilst the tower is blowing Bold, it cannot
blow Ariel. Each brand has several different formulations, such as Bold Automat­
ic and Bold Low Temperature. This further constrains manufacturing capability
(although some products can be formulated finally by clever use of additives at
the filling and packing stage). Blowing towers are expensive pieces of capital in­
vestment, so the site has only two. It is, therefore, impossible for P&G to produce
each product formulation in line with demand. Therefore, P&G has to manufac­
ture its products in advance of retail orders, using the principles of the re-order
point shown on Figure 6.3, and must use forecasts to calculate the batch sizes.
Further allowance must be made for the time it takes to ship the product from the
National Distribution Centre (NDC, which is positioned close to P&G's packing
lines on the London factory site), the retailer's depots and its stores. Fortunately,
in the case of demand as shown in Figure 6.6, forecast accuracy should be high
and it is then possible to plan production batch sizes and buffer stocks accurately
as well. But promotions can distort even this high forecast accuracy demand.
In practice, retailers use projective forecasting for planning replenishment
quantities of stable demand items, such as that shown in Figure 6.6, from suppli­
ers such as P&G. Using sales-based ordering (SBO), retailers attem pt to match sup­
ply with POS demand as closely as possible. POS data from each of the stores that
it serves are sent to the depot, which collates sales data and so provides a sm ooth­
ing effect on demand forecasting. Even when a close logistics relationship has
been established with suppliers, coordination comes under strain because of pres­
sures brought by the trading function of the retailer to squeeze suppliers' prices.
Let us next consider the challenges that are created by different processes
between one stage of the supply chain and the next, whether caused by m anu­
facturing and retail or by different process requirements between one process and
another.

6.1.4 Inter-firm planning and control
Both Section 6.1.1 on manufacturing MPC systems and 6.1.2 on managing inde­
pendent demand show that relatively sophisticated modelling data are needed
to enable accurate and timely planning and control of logistics in a focal firm.
Attention to detail - both in planning and in execution - is key. The greater the
product variety, the more com ponent parts and the greater the number of lev­
els in the BOM, the more challenging the task. W hen it comes to coordinating
logistics between supply partners, the challenges multiply because the number of
processes at stake is so much greater. There are many other factors that make life
even more challenging, resulting from differences between the partners:
• Differences in process technology: a supplier of aluminium cans to a soft drinks
manufacturer is positioned between producers of aluminium rolled sheet,
and high speed canning lines. At the can supplier, the sheet has to be deep




drawn and printed with increasingly sophisticated designs. High speed filling
machines (1,500 cans/minute) at the soft drinks manufacturer m ean that the
lengthy changeovers are carried out as infrequently as possible. During the peak
summer sales period - when sales can double during a hot spell of weather the whole logistics pipeline is under pressure. The can supplier - situated next
to the factory of the drinks manufacturer - supplies cans through a 'hole in
the wall' conveyor, which enables just-in-time delivery. Coordinating these
three quite different manufacturing processes is a major challenge. The default
solution is to hold huge stocks at the can supplier - but, even then, you have
to hope that the forecasts were correct! If we move to the NDC for the drinks
manufacturer, the even tougher challenge is to interface manufacturing with
service processes - distribution and retail. Retail demand is not based on m anu­
facturing batch sizes, but on end-customer demand through the till - moder­
ated by weather forecasts and promotions.
• Differences in working routines: shift patterns, conditions of employment, holi­
days and shut-downs are but a few of the possible differences in working rou­
tines between partners in a supply chain. Retailers complain that they work
24/7, whilst manufacturers may work only five days/week. In turn, this means
that replenishments for weekend sales (the highest of the week) have to be
made up by extra quantities delivered on Monday and Tuesday.
• Priority planning: whilst an order for a major customer may be priority num ber 1
for the focal firm in Figure 1.3, the existence of the order may not be visible
to upstream partners. Each has different priorities to manage - and each has a
different perspective about which order should be processed next.
• Inadequacies in MPC systems design: we documented the case of a manufac­
turer of electrical cables ('ElectriCo') to specific customer orders against very
short lead times (Skipworth and Harrison, 2004). Orders from the customer - a
distributor of power leads - were placed daily against generic stocks held at
ElectriCo (MTS). Attempts to cut out these stocks at ElectriCo by changing to
MTO were frustrated by weekly MRP planning intervals, and by the fact that
each planning run took 36 hours to complete. We have surveyed a num ber of
firms to identify best practice in demand planning and forecasting (Harrison,
et al., 2004). This survey provided dozens of examples of good practice and
bad practice in these areas. Partners in a network who have weak MPC systems
potentially create problems for everyone else.
Implications o f p oor coordination

One consequence of poor coordination within a supply network is amplifica­
tion of changes in demand upstream. Amplification of demand changes has been
called the bullwhip effect. For example, a retailer may order only full truck loads
from its suppliers. Instead of understanding the actual end-customer demand, the
suppliers see huge swings in orders that are due essentially to the retailer's desire
to minimise transport costs. This has the unfortunate impact of increasing m anu­
facturing costs at the suppliers, because they are asked to make large quantities at
irregular time intervals. W hat originally may have been stable demand through
the till becomes heavily distorted.


Figure 6.7 shows an example of the bullwhip effect. Demand through the till
(the EPOS series) is relatively stable, but suppliers' shipments are anything but
stable! The original range of variation has been amplified into something much
worse. The only way in which the manufacturer can respond is to hold stocks and even those vary enormously from one week to the next. Uncertainty about
customer demand leads to large up-and-down swings in the need for capacity and
in inventory levels. This effect ripples through the supply chain. Batching rules
at the manufacturer make things even worse for its own suppliers upstream. Lee
et al. (1997) identify four major causes of the bullwhip effect:

Figure 6.7

The 'bullwhip effect' at work

• updating o f demand forecasts: resulting in changes to safety stock and stock in
the pipeline;
• order batching: whilst retail customers may buy mostly on Saturdays, MPC sys­
tems may batch orders according to different timing rules;
• price fluctuations: promotions most often result in lumping of demand into
peaks and troughs, when the ongoing pattern is stable;
• rationing and shortage gaming: when the latest games console is in short supply,
retailers are rationed by manufacturers. Customers place multiple orders on
different retailers and thus create apparent demand amplification.
To make matters even worse, it is quite possible for material movements in sup­
ply chains to descend into chaos (Wilding, 1998). Chaos is characterised by the
following:
• The same state is never repeated ('aperiodic').
• On successive iterations, the state stays within a finite range and does not
approach infinity ('bounded').




• There is a definite rule with no random terms governing the dynamics ('deter­
ministic').
• Two points that initially are close will drift apart over time.
Wilding lists several implications for management, three of which are:
• Supply chains do not reach stable equilibrium: small perturbations will always pre­
vent equilibrium being achieved.
• Treat the supply chain as a complete system. Small changes made to optimise one
echelon of the supply chain can result in massive changes in other parts of the
chain. Driving down inventory and lead times may not always improve perfor­
mance. It could result in the system slipping into chaos.
• Remove chaos by focusing on the end-customer: communicate demand informa­
tion as far upstream as possible.

Implications for p lanning an d controlling the supply chain

Based on evidence from MPC systems in manufacturing, the intricacies of manag­
ing independent demand and the conclusions of the bullwhip effect and chaos
theory, we can say that coordinating material flow across the supply network
requires attention to detail in both planning and execution across the supply
chain. So, often, firms have 'orchestrated' (or did we mean 'optimised'?) the sup­
ply chain around their own interests, for example - automotive manufacturers,
'big pharm a' and retailers! Making MPC systems work together, in a supply chain
context, requires hard work, not just a com m itm ent to collaboration and 'part­
nership'. We return to these issues in Chapters 9 and 10.
We now consider a pull approach to coordinating material flow across the sup­
ply chain - just-in-time (JIT) - which eliminates the bullwhip effect by enabling
the end-customer demand to pull material through the chain of companies.

6.2 Just-in-time (JIT) scheduling
Key issues: W hat are the implications of just-in-time for logistics? How can just-

in-time principles be applied to other forms of material control, such as material
requirements planning?

In this section, we focus on the application of JIT to logistics. This partial view
of JIT has been called little JIT (Chase et al., 2005): there is far more to this wideranging approach to m anagement than we present here (see, for example, Har­
rison, 1992). Nevertheless, little JIT has enormous implications for logistics, and
has spawned several logistics versions of JIT concepts.
The partial view of JIT is an approach to material control based on the view
that a process should operate only when a customer signals a need for more parts
from that process. W hen a process is operated in the JIT way, goods are produced
and delivered just-in-time to be sold. This principle cascades upstream through
the supply network, with subassemblies produced and delivered just-in-time to


be assembled, parts fabricated and delivered just-in-time to be built into subas­
semblies, and materials bought and delivered just-in-time to be made into fabri­
cated parts. Throughout the supply network, the trigger to start work is governed
by demand from the customer - the next process (Schonberger, 1991). A supply
network can be conceived as a chain o f customers, with each link coordinated with
its neighbours by JIT signals. The whole network is triggered by demand from the
end-customer. Only the end-customer is free to place demand whenever he or she
wants; after that the system takes over.
The above description of the flow of goods in a supply chain is characteristic
of a pull material flow system. Parts are pulled through the chain in response
to demand from the end-customer. This contrasts with a push system, in which
products are made whenever resources (people, material and machines) become
available in response to a central plan or schedule (as described in Section 6.1).
The two systems of controlling materials can be distinguished as follows:
• Pull scheduling: a system of controlling materials whereby the user signals to
the maker or provider that more material is needed. Material is sent only in
response to such a signal.
• Push scheduling: a system of controlling materials whereby makers and pro­
viders make or send material in response to a pre-set schedule, regardless of
whether the next process needs them at the time.
The push approach is a common way for processes to be managed, and often
seems a sensible option. If some of the people in a factory or an office are idle, it
seems a good idea to give them work to do. The assumption is that those products
can be sold at some point in the future. A similar assumption is that building up
a stock of finished goods will quickly help to satisfy the customer. This argument
seems particularly attractive where manufacturing lead times are long, if quality
is a problem or if machines often break down. It is better and safer to make prod­
uct, just in case there's a problem in the future. Unfortunately, this argument has
severe limitations. Push scheduling and its associated inventories do not always
help companies to be more responsive. All too often, the very products the organ­
isation wants to sell are unavailable, whilst there is too much stock of products
that are not selling. And building up stock certainly does not help to make more
productive use of spare capacity. Instead it can easily lead to excess costs, and hide
opportunities to improve processes.

6.2.1 The just-in-time system
Companies achieve the ability to produce and deliver just-in-time to satisfy
actual dem and because they develop a production system that is capable of
working in this way. Such a system can be envisaged as a num ber of 'factors'
that interact w ith each other, as shown in Figure 6.8. This shows JIT capability
as founded on layers of factors that interact together to form a system that is
designed for flow. Excellence in each of the six factors determines the effective­
ness with which JIT capability can be achieved: that is, how easy it is to get to
the top of the pyramid.





Figure 6.8

The pyramid of key factors that underpin JIT

Factor 1

The top of the pyramid is full capability for just-in-time supply. This is the level at
which a focal firm can produce and deliver according to the demand that is placed
on it. The relationships operating within and between levels 2 and 3 form the sys­
tem that ultimately underpins the achievement of JIT. They are complex, and in
some cases there is a long time delay between taking actions and seeing the effects.
Factor 2

The two factors delay and inventory interact with each other in a system of positive
amplification; that is, they go up together and they go down together. This inter­
relationship results in either a virtuous cycle, where things keep getting better,
or a vicious cycle, where they keep getting worse. For example, extra delay in a
process will result in extra inventory being held to compensate for the delay. Add­
ing more inventory causes further delays as products take longer to flow through
the process, which leads to the need for more inventory. Conversely, if delays are
reduced, then less inventory is needed, which results in fewer delays, meaning
that inventory can be further reduced. Making sure this relationship operates as
a virtuous cycle of reducing delay and inventory instead of a vicious one where
they increase, depends on the underpinning factors in level 3.
Factor 3

Defects lead to delays, either through requiring rework or necessitating increased
production to compensate for scrap. The likelihood of defects leads to safety
stocks being held as a buffer against potential problems. This thinking ampli­
fies quality problems by increasing the time between a defect occurring and its
discovery. Not only is the cause harder to identify, but more production will be
affected. The attitude that holding inventory can mitigate the effect of quality
problems is fundamentally flawed. It stands in opposition to the only successful
approach to defect minimisation, where problems are quickly identified, their
causes are traced, and perm anent solutions are devised and applied.


Factor 4

Machine downtime relates to a number of issues:
• unplanned downtime - that is, breakdowns;
• planned maintenance;
• changeover times.
Downtime, and particularly the risk of unplanned downtime, is a key cause of
the need for safety stocks in a process. Other JIT tools and techniques can help
to minimise the problems here. For example, total productive maintenance (TPM;
Nakajima, 1989) seeks to answer the question 'W hat can everyone do to help
prevent breakdowns?' Regular planned preventive maintenance, closer coopera­
tion between production and maintenance personnel, and equipm ent sourcing
for ease of maintenance are some of the actions that can be taken in response.
In other words, increasing planned m aintenance costs often results in reduced
overall costs of machine downtime. Minimising changeover time is a JIT tool that
can be used not only to reduce lost production time but also improve production
flexibility. Inflexible facilities delay the rapid production of customer orders.
Factor 5

Where the flow through a process is easily seen, people in the process will
have a better understanding of their colleagues' work and how they themselves
affect others. A simple process results from having first focused operations around
a family of compatible products. Layout is then organised to bring together all
the people and equipment needed to undertake the process. These are arranged
so that there is a logical flow between the process steps. Arranging the process so
that the stations for undertaking the steps are close together not only helps to
reduce inventory but also will itself be made easier when inventory is low. A
simple process will be more visible, allowing it to be better maintained. Not only
should there be fewer things to go wrong, they will be more obvious when they
do, and will be easier to fix. This attribute helps to minimise both machine down­
time and product defects.
Maintenance of the process is underpinned by housekeeping and cleanliness.
This starts with designing processes and facilities to create order. There is a place
for everything, and everything has its place. Orderliness depends on a thinking
workforce that has accepted ownership and responsibility for organising the work
place. Attention to detail in terms of 'respect for hum an' issues is an essential part
of JIT philosophy (Harrison and Storey, 2000).
Factor 6

The levels of work in progress and other types of inventory have a significant
impact upon the visibility of a process. It becomes increasingly difficult to see the
flow of a process as inventory increases. This may be literally true on a shop floor
or in a warehouse, where piles and stacks of goods can isolate workers. The same
is true in offices when the process flow becomes lost in assorted piles of work on
people's desks.




In order to highlight the limitations of push production we next consider the
case of how a focal firm took a rather traditional approach to responding to new
demands being placed on the production process, in Case study 6.2.

CASE STUDY 6.2

Smog Co.
The Smog Co. production system
This is the case of Smog Co., a small supplier of well-engineered components. Smog
produces a range of products grouped into families. Production of one of the highervolume product families has been organised into a flow process made up of four
steps, which follow one after the other in sequence. Changeover from one prod­
uct to another is relatively simple, but takes around 10 minutes per machine. To
minimise delays caused by changeovers, products tend to be made in batches. These
batches move from one step to the next, where they queue on a first in, first out
basis to be worked on, after which they move to the next step. This process is shown
in Figure 6.9.

Figure 6.9

The Smog production process

Key measures of the performance of this process are the utilisation of people and of
machines. The objective is to keep utilisation of both as high as possible. In this situa­
tion, if people or machines are idle - and material is available - they are used to make
something. Naturally it w ouldn't make sense to make anything. Instead the produc­
tion manager has a feel for what is needed, and uses a forecast from the sales depart­
ment to make an early start on products that it is considered will be required in the
near future.
Fred Hollis, the Smog production manager, felt pleased with performance as he
looked out across the factory. He was pleased because his machines and people were
busy, there were plenty of finished goods on hand, which the sales team could use to
supply customers, and there was stock to call upon if product demand increased. Every­
thing seemed to be under control.

Changes to custom er requirem ents
The motivation to change from the current system has been low in the past, as the
process at Smog Co. is a reliable one, which has worked well for the company. The 'big
three' customers, who take three-quarters of sales, tend to order the same things in
similar quantities one week in advance of delivery. With a production lead time of three
weeks, Smog Co. uses a forecast to schedule production and make sure that finished
goods stocks will be available to meet predicted demand. Consistent demand means


that forecasts are often close to real demand, so stock-outs are rare. In fact, the only
time this occurred was an incident a couple of years ago, when a key machine went
down and a spare part took a long time to source. Current inventory levels now include
safety stock to provide cover against a similar problem in the future.
When the company found that certain finished goods were selling slowly, the sales
team was particularly good at finding a way to move them. Sometimes prices were cut;
at other times Sales used special promotions. If production was too high, or the forecast
was a bit optimistic, then there were ways of selling surplus stock, and the sales team
seemed to enjoy the challenge.
Recently, however, this well-understood position has begun to change. The main
customers have started to use a number of new strategies to compete with each other.
First one, and now a second, has announced that it will be reducing the call-off time for
its products from one week to two working days. At the same time they are all looking
for a 5 per cent cost reduction, and are demanding quality improvements.

A 'tra d itio n a l' reaction to custom er dem ands fo r b e tte r service
The combination of demands for better services caused Smog management some
concern. The obvious response to the changes in ordering patterns was to increase
stock levels to cater for unexpected variations in demand. This approach had worked
before, when it was used to justify the safety stocks that covered production problems.
It seemed worth trying again, so stocks were increased.
Things went well over the first few months, during which time delivery performance
remained good, whilst the customers went ahead with their plan to reduce the order
lead time. Keeping up with these orders provided the production manager with a few
headaches. Preventing stock-outs led to an increase in the number of batches being
expedited through the factory. This disrupted the production plan, increased the num­
ber of machine changeovers and lowered productivity. As a result, overtime increased
in order to maintain output.
The higher level of inventory meant that quality problems were harder to detect.
In one case a new operator missed a drilling operation. By the time the first customer
discovered the error, nearly two weeks' worth of production had to be recalled and
reworked.
The higher inventory levels were also taking up more space. Fred Hollis had submit­
ted a requisition to the finance director to pay for more storage racking. The extra racks
were necessary because existing ones were full, and parts stored on the floor were suf­
fering occasional damage in an increasingly cramped factory. Some parts were returned
recently by a customer, who felt that damaged packaging indicated damaged products.
Naturally, Fred was concerned when his request for more storage space was turned
down owing to spending reductions imposed in response to price cuts demanded by
customers.
Reflecting on what had happened at Smog, the increase in stock levels had badly
affected competitiveness. Smog Co. was experiencing the consequences of trying to
forecast demand and using the forecast to determine what to make. Their 'make to
stock' approach was responsible for:
•

removing the company's ability to be responsive to changes in either quantities or
product mix;




•
•

increasing costs and making quality problems worse;
burying underlying production problems under inventory, and thereby preventing
efforts to uncover and resolve them.

In conclusion, whilst the company had been motivated to change by its customers,
the direction it took seemed to have caused many problems.

6.2.2 JIT and material requirements planning
As we saw in Section 6.1, material requirements planning (MRP) was conceived
in order to answer the questions how many? and when? in ordering parts that are
directly used to manufacture end products. MRP is a logical and systematic way
of planning materials. It links downstream demand with manufacture and with
upstream supply. It can handle detailed parts requirements, even for products
that are made infrequently and in low volumes.
On the other hand, MRP is based on a centrally controlled, bureaucratic
approach to material planning. Although it is based on a pull scheduling logic,
it instructs processes to make more parts, whether or not the customer (the next
process) is capable of accepting them. Typically, MRP adopts push scheduling
characteristics. It remains insensitive to day-to-day issues at shop floor level, and
continues to assume that its plans are being carried out to the letter. In other
words, MRP is good at planning but weak at control.
Meanwhile, JIT pull scheduling is good at handling relatively stable demand
for parts that are made regularly. It is sensitive to problems at shop floor level,
and is designed not to flood the next process with parts that it cannot work on.
On the other hand, JIT pull scheduling is not good at predicting requirements
for the future, especially for parts and products that are in irregular or sporadic
demand. JIT is good at control but weak at planning. There are clear opportunities
for putting together the strengths of both systems, so that the weaknesses of one
are covered by the strengths of the other. For example, even in systems with great
variety, many of the parts are common across much of the product range and
therefore subject to relatively stable demand. So JIT can be used to control these
parts, whilst a much downsized MRP can be used to plan what is left.
JIT has become associated with the Japanese way of cutting out waste, doing
the simple things well and getting better every day. The foundations of Toyota
Production System (TPS) are JIT and jidoka. Jidoka means hum anising the


man - machine interface so that it is the m an who runs the machine, not vice
versa. MRP has become associated with the Western way of automating our way
out of trouble, and by investing in bigger and better systems that competitors
cannot afford to match. Let us next review how these two different approaches
apply in motor manufacture by comparing Ford (which has developed its own
version of TPS called Ford Production System, FPS) and Toyota.
CASE STUDY

6.3

Ford and Toyota
A car assembly plant is built around a simple sequence of tasks that starts in the press
shop and ends as a car rolls off the final assembly line. Figure 6.10 shows these basic
tasks in summary form:

Figure 6.10

Basic tasks in a car assembly plant

Whilst these basic tasks are the same for both Ford and Toyota, the way they are man­
aged by the tw o firms is quite different. We compare policies and practices in relation to
small cars such as the Ford Fiesta and the Toyota Yaris:
•

•

Ford is driven by a long-term strategy in Europe. It has invested heavily in fixed
assets, and does not seek an early return on them. Currently, it is struggling with a
capacity that was designed for a 15 per cent market share when current loading is
only 9 per cent. It seeks to make a step change in the production process through
high capital investment. Its investment policy therefore has been technically orien­
tated, seeking the 'best' technical solution for each task. For example, Ford's body
shop is almost fully automated with robots that are flexible across different parts.
When production is changed between one part and another, the robots must be re­
programmed. This places high emphasis on technical support for the software, and
makes Ford dependent on given equipment suppliers. The layout is designed around
the robots and for fixed volumes.
Toyota has expanded cautiously in Europe. Its investment policy has been step-bystep, and it has sought to make early returns. Key to the Toyota Production System
(TPS) are process and quality disciplines through JIT and jidoka. Toyota's philosophy
is more people-orientated: shop-floor people are heavily involved in improvement
activities as well as in production work. Toyota's body shop has maybe one-third the
number of press-shop robots as Ford, and tends to use simple multi-welders at low
initial cost. It is relatively easy to swap suppliers. Tooling must be changed when




production is changed between one batch and another, but people are trained to
go for fast set-ups and to improve the process. The layout is designed around people
and volume flexibility.
Having learned much from its stake in Mazda, Ford launched its own version of
just-in-time called Ford Production System (FPS) a few years ago. Ford has done
much to reduce product complexity. This is measured basically by the number of
different body styles that are possible (see Section 5.1.2). Both Ford and Toyota have
three basic body styles, but Ford limits variation to left-hand/right-hand drive and
sunroof/no sunroof options. Since these are m ultiplicative, 12 body shells are pos­
sible. Toyota, in addition, has variations to allow for different engine types and air
conditioner types, together w ith spoiler/no spoiler versions. In total, this means that
Toyota has over 70 body shell variations. When m ultiplied again by the number of
painted body colours (say 10 for both firms), Toyota ends up w ith hundreds more
painted body options than Ford. This contributes to a surprising difference when it
comes to building the car:
•

•

Ford treats the painted body as a commodity. Once they have been painted, bodies
are kept in the painted body store, which is a buffer between the body shop and final
assembly. The Ford system calculates the number of each painted body type that
should be in the store to meet forecast final assembly requirements. The trouble is
that the store can be full of the wrong bodies, which means that it is impossible to
build the current orders. Up to this point in the sequence, the emphasis is on num­
bers, not on the end-customer. Bodies are not given a vehicle identification number
(VIN) - which allocates the body to a particular customer order - until the painted
body is removed from the store and dropped onto the trim and final assembly line.
Toyota treats the body shell as a customer's car from the start. The VIN is added
as the first process at body in white assembly, when panels are welded together to
make the shell. In turn, this drives discipline and focus in the paint shop, and helps
to improve first time through (FTT) in the paint process. The sequence of bodies
through trim and final processes is thereby more predictable, allowing more precise
material control downstream.

The parts ordering process for auto assembly is particularly challenging, because
some 2,000 individual parts are needed for each vehicle. Most of these parts are added
at the trim and final assembly stage. Whilst many of these parts are common, TPS
already has a number of advantages when it comes to customising the vehicle. First, the
more predictable sequence of painted bodies into trim and final means that there are
few last-minute schedule changes. Second, TPS sets stable lead times that are fixed at
certain times for each part. Third, supplier lead times are allowed for.
Ford, on the other hand, leaves schedules uncommitted until parts are collected. The
Ford call-off quantities are set on the day of collection, and don't allow for supplier lead
times. Figures 1.8 and 1.9 compare what happens from a supplier point of view - there
are huge differences between scheduled and actual demand.

Question

1 What changes would you propose to both TPS and to FPS in order to cope w ith cus­
tomer demands for increasing product variety and more rapid model changes?


6.3 Overcoming poor coordination in retail supply chains
Key issue: How can collaboration be extended across the supply chain to focus on

meeting consumer demand?

As a result of the challenges listed in Section 6.1.4 above, a number of initia­
tives have been launched to promote better coordination between supply chain
processes in retailing (Barratt and Oliveira, 2002). The principle being aimed for
is that stock in a retailer's stores is replenished in response to POS data. Whilst
retailers initially wanted manufacturers to do this by imposition, more recent
initiatives recognise that collaboration is needed - at least between logistics pro­
cesses at each stage of the supply chain. There are potential benefits all round more accurate replenishment quantities mean lower inventories, faster response
to demand fluctuations and improved on-shelf availability (OSA), which all leads
to improved sales.
British Standards have now recognised the importance of collaborative busi­
ness relationships and have created BS 11000 (British Standards Institute, 2010)
which 'provides a framework for collaborative business relationships to help com­
panies manage and develop their interactions with other organisations for maxi­
mum benefit for all'. We cover four collaborative approaches to improved supply
coordination, which originated in retail supply chains:
• Efficient consumer response (ECR) that has been targeted primarily in food and
fast-moving categories in the grocery sector.
• Collaborative planning, forecasting and replenishment (CPFR) that is also used pre­
dominantly by manufacturers and retailers in the grocery sector, although other
sectors where there is a broad range of SKUs subject to volatile demand also use
this approach.
• Vendor-managed inventory (VMI) is used for retail inventory but, equally, is

6.3.1

Efficient consumer response (ECR)
Established as a grocery industry initiative, efficient consumer response (ECR) is de­
signed to integrate and rationalise product assortment (range), promotion, new
product development and replenishment across the supply chain. It aims to ful­
fil the changing demands and requirements of the end-customer (consumer)
through effective collaboration across all supply chain members, in order to en­
hance the effectiveness of merchandising efforts, inventory flow and supply chain
administration (PE International, 1997).
The origins of ECR can be traced back to work carried out by Kurt Salmon
Associates (in the USA) for the apparel sector (Salmon, 1993) and, subsequent­
ly, in the grocery sector (Fernie, 1998). Since then, ECR has increased indus­
trial awareness of the growing problem of non-value-added supply chain costs




(Section 5.3.5). In Europe, ECR programmes commenced in 1993 with the com­
missioning of a series of projects, for example the Coopers & Lybrand survey of
the grocery supply chain (Coopers & Lybrand, 1996). Other examples of studies
sponsored by ECR-Europe initiatives include an O ptimal Shelf Availability report
(Roland Berger Strategy Consultants, 2003) and the Shrinkage in Europe report
(Beck, 2004).
ECR UK (www.igd.com/our-expertise/Supply-chain/ECR-UK/) is run by the
Institute of Grocery Distribution (IGD) and is organised around 'various work­
groups involved in supply improvements, focusing on using collaboration to ful­
fil shopper wishes better, faster and at less cost'. It also offers a range of tools and
resources ,which companies can access freely. Initiatives and tools available dur­
ing 2013 on the ECR UK website include:

Promotional on-shelf availability: insight an d practice

The latest results of the ECR UK Availability Survey (2013) covering 200 stores
(across Asda, Morrisons, Sainsbury's, Tesco, The Co-operative Group and Waitrose) recorded on-shelf availability at 97.3 per cent across 200 branded and
private label lines, representing an average family shop. Improving the avail­
ability of products on shelf provides an opportunity for both retailers and
m anufacturers to improve sales and profit. Promotions have always been an
im portant part of the retail offering. However, against a backdrop of challeng­
ing economic conditions, the fight for market share has intensified and with
it the number, depth and frequency of prom otional offers. This in turn puts
increased pressure on grocery supply chains and brings a num ber of opportuni­
ties and threats.
The online guide provides unique insight into the weaknesses across the sup­
ply chain and highlights best practice in m aintaining the on-shelf availability of
promotional lines.

Supply chain waste prevention

A top-level estimate of the annual volume and value of food and drink waste
along the UK grocery supply chain are shown in Figure 6.11, illustrating the
extent of the problem. This enables companies to link up with companies they
trade with, specifically to address total supply chain waste from factory in-gate
to retailer check-out till. ECR UK also provides a supply chain waste prevention
guide (2013) identifying how to prevent product and packaging waste and pro­
viding best practice examples from retailers and manufacturers.
ECR UK proposes a hierarchy of preferred options for reducing waste (as shown
in Figure 6.12) and emphasises that a company should start at the top:
• Prevent or eliminate waste by reducing the price of short-dated or damaged
stock to sell through before the food becomes waste. A five-to-drive plan for
prevention - measure, engage, forecast, design and range - is also proposed.
• Redistribute to alternative markets. For example, surplus to charities or animal
feed.

• Recycle or process into a fresh supply of the same or similar material and reduce
consumption of virgin material.
• Recover via anaerobic digestion composting, used cooking oil, rendering, en­
ergy recovery and mechanical heat treatment.
• Dispose of via landfill, thermal treatment without energy recovery or via sewer/
controlled water course.




Merchandising unit guide

This is a tool produced by the UK's Retail Packaging Workgroup that helps m anu­
facturers match their packaging formats against those accepted by leading super­
markets (Asda, Morrisons, Sainsbury's, Tesco, Waitrose, etc.). Ten merchandising
unit (MU) formats are covered providing:
• Data: description, length, width, height, weight, material(s), colour, four-way
entry, pallet entry height, pallet entry width, nom inal load capacity, tempera­
ture range, buy, rent.
• Specific retailer comments: about the MU format and compatibility with indi­
vidual infrastructure.

Optimising transport modes

This is an online resource, created by the ECR UK Transport Modes Workgroup,
that provides a practical support guide that enables users to gain an under­
standing of the alternative modes of transport and non-standard road transport
options. Every mode of transport, be it road, rail, inland waterways, short sea
shipping or air freight, has its own advantages and limitations. In developing
their distribution strategy, companies choose to use the mode that provides them
with the best solution for the market and environm ent in which they operate.
With the increasing concern for the environment, higher levels of road conges­
tion and rising fuel prices, the boundaries between which mode provides the best
economic and environmental solution are changing.
Road transport continues to dominate freight movements in the UK, being
responsible for around 83 per cent of goods moved (tonnes lifted) with HGVs
responsible for around 20 per cent of UK domestic greenhouse gas (GHG) emis­
sions. As one of biggest users of road transport, the food and grocery industry
has a responsibility to manage its impact on the environm ent and, increasingly,
companies are considering alternative transport modes.
The focus of ECR is to integrate supply chain management with demand m an­
agement. This requires collaboration between suppliers (manufacturers) and retail­
ers, and emphasises the end-consumer. However, the current ECR initiatives and
tools, as illustrated by the four described above, are tending to focus on the sup­
ply side, rather than managing demand in terms of product assortment or pro­
motions. Before we leave ECR, it is important to consider enabling technologies,
which drive ECR and make it work. They include such technologies as automated
order generation, barcoding and the use of other scanning technology. In addition,
data warehousing and data mining have facilitated our understanding of customer
requirements. Key examples of ECR enabling technologies include: electronic data
interchange (EDI) and radio frequency identification devices (RFID)
Electronic d a ta interchange (EDI)

Electronic data interchange (EDI) enables standardised electronic business mes­
sages to replace m anual paper-based processes, such as customer order schedules.


The UK grocery sector has been using EDI for more than 30 years and is at the
forefront. A joint study between Global Standards (GS1) and Cranfield University
(Adnan-Ariffin and Coussins, 2010) reported:
Our research o f the UK's top 15 grocery retailers covering 90 per cent o f the sector
has found that the sector saves £650 m illion per year in costs by u sing EDI instead
o f m anual paper-based processes for its orders, in voices and despatch advices...
Around 85 per cent o f UK grocery retailers use EDI for purchase orders and invoices
com pared w ith 27 per cent outside the grocery sector.

This demonstrates that the grocery sector is far ahead of other sectors in terms
of EDI implementation and is enjoying the savings that EDI can bring in addition
to providing the technological basis for ECR.
Radio frequency identification devices (RFIDs)

A radio frequency identification device (RFID) is a product-tracking technology
that is being applied widely in supply chains today (Angeles, 2005). An RFID,
often called a tag, can be attached to a piece of merchandise and informs a reader
about the nature and location of what it is attached to. Figure 6.13 shows how
the reader can relay this information to a management system that can create
a picture of what merchandise is where, at a level of detail that has not been
possible previously.

Figure 6.13

An RFID system

An active tag has a power source; a passive tag does not. Active tags use a bat­
tery, have a limited life and cost far more. The antenna is a device that uses radio
waves to read and/or write data to the tags. The reader manages the interface
between antenna and management system. A big advantage of RFID technology
over barcodes is that the tag does not have to be directly in the line of sight of the
reader. Tags can be detected remotely by readers because the radio waves can pass
through many materials (see, for example, www.ems-rfid.com). Trials have been
conducted across a range of frequencies - 125 kHz to 2.45 GHz for chip-based




tags - but standards are still being debated in m any sectors. The management sys­
tem enables data from tags to be collected and sorted for the purposes of manage­
m ent information and action.
The key piece of information held on a tag is the electronic product code (EPC,
standards for which were developed by the Auto-ID Centre). This 'num ber plate'
is unique to each tag. The unique number can then be linked to information
about the product to which it is attached, for example about when and where the
product was made, where its components came from and shelf-life details. Some
tags may hold this additional information on board. However, the intention is
that most tags will hold only the EPC, and additional information will be stored
remotely, on a database linked to the management system.
Readers tell us w hat the product is and where it is located in the supply chain.
The management system compiles this information and allows us to know how
m any products are present at that location for each time bucket. This translates
into dynamic data that allows us to know rates of consumption, and stock data
at a given point in time - together with what needs to be done. One can al­
ready envision that such data will enable supply chain planning and control to
be transformed.
Product tagging allows for several interesting applications including:
• tracking products throughout the distribution pipeline ('asset tracking') to pro­
vide continuous quantities and position by SKU in the supply chain;
• tracking products through back of store to the shelf;
• intelligent shelves, whereby 'sweeping' of product by thieves from shelves in
store shows up automatically and raises alarm signals;
• registering sales without involving a cashier: a fancied future state is one where
shoppers push their trolley past readers that automatically read EPCs for each
item in the trolley, and present the bill for credit card payment to the shopper
without the need for retailer personnel to be involved.
Benefits for manufacturers include the ability to understand when products are
in the store but not on the shelf (a source of lost sales that manufacturers can­
not control) and reducing the opportunities for theft. Retailer benefits include
ability to track products in the pipeline against delivery schedules, autom ation
of the checkout process and ability to expand customer information on buying
patterns.
Technically, products can be tracked all the way to the customer's home and
into it. However, when Benetton planned to track products after the sale, with
an eye on returns, it was m et with customer resistance on grounds of invasion of
privacy. This caused Benetton to delay plans for rolling out this idea. The other
major hurdle to implementation is the price of the tags. Price/margin levels in
most consumer packaged-goods tags need to be low enough to be affordable at
the individual product level. Whilst Wal-Mart has m andated tag application from
its major suppliers, technical issues with readers so far have kept RFID develop­
m ent at pallet level. Beyond product-level tagging in retail channels, m any other
applications are already in place at case-level, and in higher-value goods such as
automotive parts.


CASE STUDY

6.4

ECR in the UK
Dutchman Paul Polman, now CEO of Unilever, did a stint as general manager of Procter
& Gamble UK. Whilst admiring the UK's advanced retailing systems, he saw opportuni­
ties for all four 'pillars of ECR': range, new items, promotions and replenishment. The
following is extracted from the text of a speech he made to the Institute of Grocery
Distribution in October 2009.

Range
The average store now holds 35 per cent more than 5 years ago, yet a typical consumer
buys just 18 items on a trip. A quarter of these SKUs sell fewer than six units a week!
The number of SKUs offered by manufacturers and stores has become too large and
complex. My company is equally guilty in this area. No question, we make too many
SKUs. I can assure you we are working on it. Actually, our overall SKU count in laundry
is already down 20 per cent compared to this time last year. What's more, business is
up. Clearly, we have an opportunity to rationalise our ranges. As long as we do this in
an ECR way - focusing on what consumers want - we will all win. The consumer will see
a clearer range. Retailers and manufacturers will carry less inventory and less complex­
ity. The result will be cost savings across the whole supply chain and stronger margins.

N e w items
There were 16,000 new SKUs last year. Yet 80 per cent lasted less than a year. You don't
need to be an accountant to imagine the costs associated with this kind of activity.
And look how this has changed. Since 1975, the number of new SKU introductions has
increased eightfold. Yet their life expectancy has shrunk from around five years in 1975
to about nine months now. We can hardly call this progress.

Prom otions
In promotions it's the same story. Take laundry detergents. This is a fairly stable market.
Yet we're spending 50 per cent more on promotions than two years ago, w ith con­
sumers buying nearly 30 per cent more of their volume on promotions. This not only
creates an inefficient supply chain, or in some cases poor in-store availability, but, more
importantly, has reduced the value of the category and likely the retailers' profit. We're
all aware of the inefficiencies promotions cause in the system, such as problems in pro­
duction, inventory and in-store availability. They all create extra costs, which ultimately
have to be recouped in price. But there's a higher cost. As promotions are increasing,
they are decreasing customer loyalty to both stores and brands by 16 per cent during
the period of the promotion. We commissioned a report by Professor Barwise of the
London Business School. He called it 'Taming the Multi-buy Dragon'. The report shows
us that over 70 per cent of laundry promotional investment goes on multi-buys. The
level of investment on multi-buys has increased by 60 per cent over the last three years.
There's been a 50 per cent increase behind brands and a doubling of investment behind
own labels. Contrary to what we thought, most of this volume is not going to a broad
base of households. It is going to a small minority. Seventy-one per cent of all multi-buy
volume is bought by just 14 per cent of households, just 2 per cent of multi-buy volume




goes to 55 per cent of households. We really are focusing our spending on influencing
and rewarding a very small minority of people indeed.

Replenishm ent
Based on the escalating activity I've just [referred to], costs are unnecessarily high. There
are huge cost savings also here, up to 6 per cent, by removing the non-value-added
SKUs and inefficient new brand and promotional activity.

Questions
1 Cutting down on range, new items and promotions is presumably going to lead to
'everyday low prices'. Discuss the implications to the trade-off between choice and
price.
2 Procter & Gamble's major laundry brand in the USA is Tide. This is marketed in some
60 pack presentations, some of which have less than 0.1 per cent share. The prolifera­
tion of these pack presentations is considered to have been instrumental in increas­
ing Tide's market share from 20 to 40 per cent of the US market in recent years.
Clearly, this is a major issue within P&G. What are the logistics pros and cons of
SKU proliferation?

6.3.2 Collaborative planning, forecasting and replenishment (CPFR)
Collaborative planning, forecasting and replenishment (CPFR) is aimed at
improving collaboration between buyer and supplier so that customer service
is improved whilst inventory m anagement is made more efficient. The trade­
off between customer service and inventory is thereby altered (Oliveira and
Barratt, 2001).
The CPFR movement originated in 1995. It was the initiative of five compa­
nies: Wal-Mart, Warner-Lambert, Benchmarking Partners, and two software com­
panies, SAP and Manugistics. The goal was to develop a business model to forecast
and replenish inventory collaboratively. An initial pilot was tested between WalMart and Warner-Lambert using the Listerine mouthwash product and focusing
on stocks kept in the retail outlets. The concept and process was tested initially by
exchanging pieces of paper. This generated clear visibility of the process required
and the requirements for the IT specification. The two companies later dem on­
strated in a computer laboratory that the internet could be used as a channel for
this information exchange.
In 1998 the Voluntary Inter-industry Commerce Standards Association (VICS)
became involved in the movement, which enabled it to make major strides for­
ward. VICS was formed in 1986 to develop barcode and electronic data inter­
change (EDI) standards for the retail industry. The involvement of VICS m eant
that other organisations could participate in the validation and testing of the
CPFR concept. With VICS support, organisations including Procter & Gamble,


Kmart and Kimberly-Clark undertook pilots to test the idea of sharing informa­
tion to improve inventory handling. One of the pilots in the UK grocery sector is
described in Case study 6.5.

CASE STUDY

6 .5

CPFR trials in the UK grocery sector
CPFR pilots have been a popular diversion in the UK grocery sector. Often, they show as in this case - that considerable opportunities for improvement exist, but that the
problems of scaling up the pilot are too great. The scenario for this pilot, researched by
one of our Master's students, Alexander Oliveira, was a manufacturer that supplied a
major grocery retailer in the UK. Figure 6.6 (page 220) shows the typical demand series
for one of the ten products in the study, all of which were in the high-volume ambient
category. Total sales through the till (EPOS) for a given week were really quite stable.
Whilst there is apparent high demand variation, most of this is due to predictable behav­
iour such as that due to different store opening hours. The day-to-day demand for this
product actually was relatively stable over the course of a year. Figure 6.14 places the
pilot in context. The manufacturer's national distribution centre (NDC) supplied one of
the retailer's regional distribution centres (RDCs), which in turn served 10 stores in the
pilot (it served a lot more stores in total - about 80).

Figure 6.14

A collaborative planning pilot

The starting situation that Alexander found was that forecasting methods were based
on a history of the last two to three months. Whilst this gave the correct day-to-day
pattern, it was insensitive to actual demand during a given week. As can be seen in
Figure 6.6, the actual demand pattern varies from day to day across the series due to




a proportion of randomness in the pattern. The replenishment cycle was unresponsive
because daily deliveries were based on forecasts. This resulted in high safety stocks and
poor on-shelf availability. Figure 6.15 provides an inventory profile across the supply
chain. The sum of the vertical (average days of stock) and horizontal (average lead time
in days) gives the total time for a new batch of product to progress from manufacturing
site to shelf of a massive four to five weeks!

Figure 6.15

Pipeline map at start of pilot

Alexander coordinated the provision of forecast data from both manufacturer and
supplier. Both forecasts were posted on a website, and he was asked to provide instruc­
tions as to how much product the manufacturer should supply each day. Stock for the
ten stores was 'ring fenced' at the retailer's RDC - that is, it could not be supplied to any
other than the ten stores in the pilot.
Alexander soon found that current forecast data did not take daily fluctuations into
account, and was based on far too long a history period. By tracking daily demand, it
was possible to allow for the randomness w ithout anything like the current quantity of
safety stock in the system. He developed a new replenishment algorithm that was based
on the daily error between forecast and actual, and which added an extra day's buffer
stock. It soon became obvious that it was possible to run the system on far lower stock
levels at the retailer's NDC, as shown in Figure 6.16.

Figure 6.16

Pipeline map at end of pilot


Alexander's work had succeeded in reducing the stock level at the NDC from 7 days
to 3 days (72 hours). In spite of the huge potential savings, the retailer did not go ahead
w ith scaling up the pilot. This can be attributed to several factors. First, many other
improvement initiatives were under way. The CPFR initiative would have needed further
scarce resources. Second, scaling up would have required a different operating routine
at all NDCs and the supporting IT infrastructure would need to have been changed.
Third, what worked with one relatively efficient manufacturer may not have worked
with others. Nevertheless, Alexander came up with the following five enablers for CPFR
implementation (Barratt and Oliveira, 2002):
1 Define single point o f contact for each trading partner: to ensure that information is
neither lost nor deteriorates during the exchange.
2 Define agenda for collaboration (short-, medium-, long-term): to stabilise the collab­
orative goals over time.
3 Expand collaborative projects (scope and complexity): to gain critical mass.
4 Ensure continuous sharing o f information: a key enabler of collaborative planning.
5 Development o f trust: this takes time. Smaller problems are removed gradually from the
CPFR process to help partners develop confidence that the long-term goal is achievable.
Questions

1 Suppose that the retailer's total sales were €20 billion, and that the 10 SKUs together
accounted for 0.4 per cent of these sales. Calculate the approximate savings in inven­
tory to the retailer.
2 Do you consider that the reasons given for not scaling up the pilot are valid?
3 Would there be any benefits to the manufacturer?

Having shown that the CPFR concept can have bottom-line impact on their
businesses, companies are looking to expand the programmes from the handful of
items involved in the pilots to the hundreds or thousands of items covered in most
trading relationships. This has been a challenge for all organisations, including
the software providers, for whom a major focus has been to ensure that software
is scaleable; that is, that there are no barriers to the number of organisations and
products involved in the CPFR network.
W hen implementing CPFR, a significant am ount of time and effort is required
up-front to negotiate specific items such as goals and objectives, frequency of
updates to plan, exception criteria and key performance measures. The result is a
published document defining the relevant issues for each organisation that has
been jointly developed and agreed.
A nine-step business model was published by VICS (VICS CPFR Guidelines,
1998). This 'road map' offers organisations a structured approach to CPFR imple­
m entation, based on the experiences of buyer and supplier companies involved
in the CPFR pilots. The model is as follows:
1 Develop front-end agreement.
2 Create joint business plans.




3 Create individual sales forecasts.
4 Identify exceptions to sales forecasts.
5 Resolve/collaborate on exception items.
6 Create order forecast.
7 Identify exceptions to order forecast.
8 Resolve/collaborate on exception items.
9 Generate orders.
In summary, CPFR focuses on the process of forecasting supply and demand by
synchronising various plans and projections from both the supplier and the cus­
tomer. CPFR requires extensive support in the form of internet-based products,
which can result in major changes to the key business processes. An academic
survey of the success of CPFR (Oliveira and Barratt, 2001) found a significant
correlation between companies with high information systems capabilities and
the success of CPFR projects. The firms with high levels of CPFR implementation
use information systems capable of providing timely, accurate, user-friendly and
inter-functional information in real time.
Skjoett-Larsen et al. (2003) propose that CPFR should be seen as a general ap­
proach to integrating supply chain processes, and not as a rigid, step-by-step model
as proposed by VICS. In keeping with this view, Lapide (2010) states that, 'CPFR con­
cepts have been successfully implemented, however, not in the same "standardised”
ways we all thought they would over 14 years ago at the peak of the hype!'
The electronic integration aspects of collaborative planning are further re­
viewed in Section 8.1.3.

Benefits o f electronic collaboration

Attaran and Attaran (2007) claim that most companies and industries can ben­
efit from CPFR and they reports cases of success in Wal-Mart, Procter & Gamble,
Heineken USA, Dell Computers and Coca-Cola. Further, they insist that compa­
nies that experience variation in demand, those that buy or sell a product on a
periodic basis and those that deal in highly differentiated or branded products
will benefit the most. Nestlé UK states that the advantages of collaborative sys­
tems are significant, and lists the following benefits:
• There is improved availability of product to the consumer, and hence more
sales.
• Total service is improved, total costs are reduced (including inventory, waste
and resources), and capacities can be reduced owing to the reductions in u n ­
certainty.
• Processes that span two or more companies become far more integrated and
hence simple, standard, speedy and certain.
• Information is communicated quickly, in a more structured way, and is trans­
parent across the supply chain to all authorised users. All users know where to
find up-to-date information.
• An audit trail can be provided to say w hen information was amended.


• Email prompts can update users of variance and progress, and can confirm
authorisations.
• The data that are in the system can be used for m onitoring and evaluation
purposes.
• The process can be completed in a quick timescale, at a lower total cost.
• All trading partners become more committed to the shared plans and objec­
tives. Changes are made with more care, and are immediately visible to all.
Many of these benefits are being experienced by those implementing the CPFR
philosophy. Wal-Mart and Sara Lee experienced sales increases of 45 per cent and
a decline in weeks-on-hand inventory of 23 per cent. The benefits experienced
by Procter & Gamble and its retail partners include a reduction in replenishment
cycle time of 20 per cent. The increased visibility of the supply chain resulted in
a reduction of in-store availability from 99 to 88 per cent being detected with suf­
ficient lead time to respond. This saved three to four days of stock-outs for the re­
tailer. Forecast accuracy improvements of 20 per cent have also been experienced.

6.3.3 Vendor-managed inventory (VM I)
Vendor-managed inventory (VMI), is an approach to inventory and order fulfil­
m ent whereby the supplier, not the customer, is responsible for managing and
replenishing inventory. At first sight this appears to counter the principle of pull
scheduling, because the preceding process (the manufacturer) is deciding how
m any and when to send to the next process (the retailer). In practice, the basis on
which decisions will be made is agreed with the retailer beforehand, and is based
on the retailer's sales information. Under VMI, the supplier assumes responsibil­
ity for m onitoring sales and inventory, and uses this information to trigger re­
plenishment orders. In effect, suppliers take over the task of stock replenishment.
Autom ated VMI originated in the late 1980s with department stores in the USA
as a solution to manage the difficulties in predicting demand for seasonal cloth­
ing. Prior to this, manual VMI had been around for many years - particularly in
the food industry. Under manual VMI, the manufacturer's salesman took a record
of inventory levels and re-ordered products for delivery to the customer's store,
where the manufacturer's representative would restock the shelves. As product
variety has increased and lifecycles have shortened, manual VMI has been re­
placed by automated VMI.
H ow V M I works

The supplier tracks its customers' product sales and inventory levels, sending
goods only when stocks run low. The decision to supply is taken by the supplier,
not the customer, as is the case traditionally. The supplier takes this decision
based on the ability of the current level of inventory to satisfy prevailing market
demand, whilst factoring in the lead time to resupply. The smooth running of
VMI depends on a sound business system. It also requires effective teamwork
between the retailer and the manufacturer. In order for both parties to gain full




benefit from the system, appropriate performance measures need to be used. The
top priority measure is that of product availability at the retailer. It is in both
parties' interests to maximise product availability, avoiding lost sales in the short
term and building customer buying habits in the long term. By emphasising the
supplier's responsibility for maximising product availability, VMI aims to achieve
this with minimum inventories. In order to combine both of these apparently con­
flicting goals, it is necessary to have access to real-time demand at the customer.
The most widely used technology for broadcasting demand data from the re­
tailer customer is electronic data interchange (EDI), as discussed in Section 6.2.1.
This provides the means for exchanging data from customer to suppliers in a
standard format. Internet-based applications using EDI protocols are increasingly
popular, providing the same facility at lower cost. Customer demand and inven­
tory data are often processed through software packages to automate the applica­
tion of decision rules and to identify stock lines that need replenishment.
Potential benefits

The immediate benefit to a supplier engaged in VMI is access to data on:
• customer sales;
• inventory levels at the customer.
The assumption is that the supplier can use these data to provide better control
of the supply chain and so deliver benefits for both the customer and themselves.
Having the supplier take the decision on replenishment aims to minimise the
impact of demand amplification. This critical problem erodes customer service,
loses sales and increases costs. The ability to dampen demand amplification
caused by infrequent, large orders from customers is key to the success of VMI.
The surplus capacity and excess finished goods held by suppliers to counteract
such variation can then be reduced.
In the longer term, suppliers should integrate demand information into their
organisation and develop the capability to drive production with it. This helps
to replace the traditional push scheduling, based on forecasts and buffer stocks,
with pull scheduling, based on meeting known demand instantaneously out of
manufacturing.

Activity 6.1
There are a number of different ways in which the use of VMI can benefit the supplier and the
customer. Make a list of those benefits you think exist under the headings of 'supplier benefits'
and 'customer benefits'.

Potential problems in setting up a V M I system

Other than the practical difficulties of setting up a VMI system, a num ber of
problems can prevent the attainm ent of the above benefits. Six of them are listed
below.


Unwillingness to share data

Retailers may be unwilling to share their marketing plans and product range strat­
egies with manufacturers. This is particularly true in the UK, where supermarkets
have strong own brands that compete with those of the manufacturers.
Retailers continue to be the owners of information on actual demand passing
through their tills. An inability to forward this information, whether due to re­
luctance or to procedural and technical problems, will prevent suppliers from re­
sponding effectively, leading to the need for buffer stocks and increasing the risk
of stock-outs.
Seasonal products

The benefits of VMI are quickly eroded in fashion and seasonal products, espe­
cially apparel. VMI in these cases can involve suppliers making to stock based on
a pre-season forecast with little scope for manufacturing in season. Small quanti­
ties are delivered from this stock to the retailers over the season. Naturally, the
forecast is regularly at odds with actual demand, so products will be understocked
or overstocked frequently. In effect, all that has happened is that the burden of
owning inventory and disposing of excesses has been moved onto the supplier.
Investment and restructuring costs

Adopting a VMI approach incurs a high investment by the customer and supplier.
Setting up the processes and procedures for undertaking this new way of working
takes time and effort. The customer will need to close their materials manage­
m ent function if they are to make cost savings, whilst the supplier will need to
develop the capability to take over this task.
Retailer vulnerability

The process of outsourcing materials management to suppliers makes the retailer
more dependent on them.
Lack of standard procedures

The practicalities of the processes and procedures that underpin VMI may not
be transferable from one customer to another. Customers may ask for different
tagging methods or bespoke labelling. With many industrial products there is no
barcode standard.
System maintenance

Errors creep into inventory records due to incorrect part counts, mislabelling,
damage, loss and theft. These records need to be maintained through manual
methods such as stock counts.

6.3.4 Quick response (QR)
Quick response (QR) is an approach to meeting customer demand by supplying
the right quantity, variety and quality at the right time to the right place at the




right price. This concept originated in the US textile and apparel industry in re­
sponse to the threat posed by overseas competitors. The concepts behind QR are
based on taking a total supply chain view of an industry. From this perspective
it is possible to understand overall performance and the causes of poor perfor­
mance, and to identify opportunities for improvement.
Understanding overall performance involves m apping the processes needed
to convert raw material into the final product (see Chapter 5). The performance
of the process is also assessed to determ ine its effectiveness. In the case of the
apparel industry, m apping followed the process of converting raw material into
fibre, th en into fabric, then into apparel and, finally, delivery to the retailer.
Key measures of the process were lead times, inventory levels and work in
progress.
This investigation found that the total process of converting raw material into
clothing took 66 weeks. A basic analysis of the process identified that 55 weeks
were taken up with products sitting in various stores as inventory. The principal
cause of this inventory was identified as being lack of communication between
the organisations in the supply network.
Such analysis is similar to that described in Chapter 5, with the process consid­
ered, in this case, being the whole supply chain from end to end. There are two
main differences between QR and a time-based approach to improvement. First,
there is an emphasis on using actual customer demand to pull products through
the distribution and manufacturing system. Second, there is extensive use of in­
formation technology as the preferred way to achieve pull. These two issues are
explored in more detail below.
Role o f enabling technologies

High variety in clothing markets - due to different sizes, styles and colours - and
in grocery markets has led these industries to use information technologies as a
means of enabling QR. These technologies are based around the use of uniform
product codes and electronic data interchange (EDI). The process involves col­
lecting merchandise information at the point of sale from the product barcode.
Data are sent to the supplier via EDI, where they are compared with an inven­
tory model for the store concerned. W hen appropriate, production is ordered for
the specific items needed to restock the store to the requirements of the model.
Once these items have been made, the cycle is completed when they are packed,
shipped to the store and delivered to the shelf.
This process has enormous implications for links across the supply chain. With
each retailer having a range of suppliers, and each supplier servicing a number
of retailers, there is the need for common barcode standards across the industry.
The retailer needs to have a scanning and data capture system to identify the item
being sold. It will need to have a re-ordering system that links the item to its m an­
ufacturer, and that places an order. Information needs to be exchanged between
the parties in a comm on data format that can be read by different IT systems. The
high volume of transactions means that the systems handling the data exchange
need to be robust and reliable. Having been informed of the sale, the supplier in­
puts this information to its manufacturing planning system in order to schedule
production and the ordering of supplies.


It is hardly surprising that it is extremely difficult to achieve this integration
across the whole of a supply network. There are significant implications for small
businesses, which have difficulty justifying the cost of the IT system and the as­
sociated training. These set-up costs can deter new companies with innovative
products from being able to supply. Recent developments in internet-based ap­
plications are helping to resolve this situation because the implementation and
data transfer costs are much lower.

Summary
H o w is m a te ria l flow p la n n e d a n d controlled in the supply chain?

• Material planning and control in manufacturing is based on three time periods long term, medium term and short term.
• The focal firm 'game plan' comprises a set of inter-linked modules ranging from
'front end' (demand management, resource planning, sales and operations
planning and master production scheduling) to 'engine' (materials and capacity
planning) to 'back end' (detailed planning and control of source-make-deliver
processes). All are linked to the enterprise resource planning (ERP) database.
• After manufacture, replenishment of independent demand items in the supply
chain is usually managed by order-point methods like EOQ and POQ. Periodic
review places orders of variable size at fixed intervals.
• Retail processes have other, distinct challenges when it comes to material plan­
ning and control. Stock must be available to generate sales, so OSA is a key
performance measure. Sales must be supported across a m uch wider range of
SKUs. The top priority of retailers has been to serve the market, and m anu­
facturers traditionally have been expected to serve retail processes. Shrinkage
(stock losses) and the impact of promotions are further challenges.
• Coordinating material planning and control between firms greatly increases
the need for management of detail. There are m any more ways to inhibit the
accurate exchange of data than within a focal firm. This results in undesir­
able symptoms like the bullwhip effect and even chaotic behaviour of material
movements.
W h a t is JIT, a n d h o w does it ap ply to logistics?

• JIT is a broad-based philosophy of doing the simple things right and gradually

doing them better. As applied to logistics, JIT can be conceived as a pyramid of
key factors that centre on m inim um delay and m inim um inventory.
• 'How many' and 'when' to order replenishment quantities are key questions
that impact on throughput times and inventories. JIT addresses these ques­
tions by attacking the sources and causes of waste. Examples are reduction of
changeover times and simple, paperless systems of material control based on
the principle of pull scheduling.
• Comparing MRP and JIT: JIT pull scheduling works best for control; MRP for
planning.




H o w is it possible to improve coordination between retail a n d m anufactu ring
processes?

• Efficient consumer response (ECR) is aimed at integrating SCM with demand
management by means of category management, product replenishment and
enabling technologies.
• Collaborative planning, forecasting and replenishment (CPFR) aims to im­
prove customer service whilst inventory management is made more efficient.
• Vendor managed inventory (VMI) refers to the control of inventory manage­
m ent and replenishment by the supplier. The key performance indicator is onshelf availability (OSA) at the retailer.
• Quick response (QR) is based on taking a total supply chain view, starting with
supply chain mapping.

Discussion questions
1 Apply the MPC framework in Figure 6.1 to a restaurant. Pay special attention to iden­
tifying the front end, engine and back end components.
2 Evaluate the impact of international supply chains on the challenges to MPC systems
in practice. Does increasing the physical distance between processes mean that they
are more difficult to plan and control?
3 Demand changes from independent to dependent at the customer order decoupling
point (CODP). What actually happens to end-customer demand, and why is this
change so important in managing material flow?
4 Explain the difference between pull scheduling and push scheduling. In what circum­
stances m ight push scheduling be appropriate?
5 What actions are needed to address the problems of inter-firm planning and control
listed in Section 6.1.3? How would you go about orchestrating material movements
(for example the cheese supply chain, shown in Figure 1.1) across a grocery supply
chain?
6 Paul Polman, chief executive of Unilever, said, 'I do not work for the shareholder, to
be honest, I work for the customer. I don't drive this business by driving shareholder
value.' What matters more: value to the customer or value to the shareholder? Refer
to Section 3.7 of Chapter 3 in formulating your response. How would you expect this
question to impact on Unilever's long-term MPC strategy?
7 Dealers have criticised the way auto assemblers use JIT as an excuse for buying parts
from the inbound supply network 'so that their costs are kept down'. They then dump
finished vehicles onto the dealer by matching 'their perceptions of a marketplace de­
mand with their constraints as a manufacturer, i.e. what they've produced' (adapted
from Delbridge and Oliver, 1991). Referring to the Ford/Toyota Case study 6.3 in
this chapter, comment on the trade-offs implied in these comments from disgruntled
dealers.

CHAPTER 7

Lean thinking and agile supply chains

Objectives

The intended objectives o f this chapter are to:

•

explain how lean thinking can be used to avoid the build-up of waste
within and between supply chain processes;

•

introduce the concept of the agile supply chain as a broad-based
approach to developing responsiveness advantages;

•

explore the challenges of coping with volatile demand situations;

•

explain how capabilities can be developed and specifically targeted at
thriving in conditions of market turbulence;

•

describe how lean and agile approaches can be combined to meet market
needs.

By the end o f this chapter you should be able to:

•

understand how lean thinking can be used to improve performance of the
supply chain in meeting end-customer demand by cutting out waste;

•

identify the type of market conditions under which agile strategies are
appropriate, and how they can be operationalised;

•

understand the distinctions between lean and agile strategies, and how
the tw o can work together.

In Chapter 9 we consider another key aspect o f the agile supply chain - the virtual
organisation.

Introduction
In Chapter 6 we considered the just-in-time (JIT) approach to scheduling and
how, by squeezing out the non-value added activities - waste - the speed of
material flow can be increased and pulled, rather than pushed. The elimination
of waste has been promoted under the banner of 'lean thinking' (Womack and
Jones, 2003), who advise:
To h ell w ith your com petitors; com pete against p e rfe ctio n by id en tifying all activi­
ties that are m u d a and elim in atin g them . This is an absolute rather than a relative
standard w h ich can provide the essential North Star for any organisation.




JIT and lean thinking share the same roots, and originate from competitive
strategies developed by the Japanese. Toyota Motor Company is held up as the
role model and, although the Toyota brand has been damaged in recent years by
widespread quality problems (Section 1.3.1), this focal firm's operational excel­
lence has had a major influence on logistics thinking today.
A common view is that lean thinking works best where demand is relatively
stable - and hence predictable - and where variety is low. But in situations where
demand is volatile and customer requirement for variety is high, the elimination
of waste in itself becomes a lower priority than the need to respond rapidly to a
turbulent marketplace. So the second part of this chapter reviews developments
under the banner of the 'agile supply chain'.
In Chapter 6, we reviewed quick response and other time-based approaches
to developing the capabilities needed to support the speed advantage. Whilst
such logistics capabilities are im portant enablers to lean and responsive supply
chains, the 'agile supply chain' takes the argument a significant step further. Mar­
ketplaces of the 21st century are characterised often by proliferation of products
and services, shorter product lifecycles and increased rates of product innovation.
Simply responding quickly and at the right time are not enough to meet the
needs of such marketplaces. The mission of modern logistics is to ensure that it is
the right product - to meet exact end-customer needs - that gets delivered in the
right place at the right time. Such a mission means that the end-customer comes
first. Section 7.2 proposes the agile supply chain as an approach that elevates
speed capabilities in a given supply chain to much higher levels than would be
possible using the tools and techniques discussed in Section 7.1.
We review the im portant capabilities required for an agile supply chain market sensitive, process integration, network based and virtual integration - and
how these are necessary to meet both predictable and unpredictable demand vari­
ability. Practices to enable agility are many, so we present those that are key, span­
ning: planning, product design, manufacturing and supply partnerships. Agility
can increase costs in terms of the necessary capacities required to respond to vola­
tile demand, so it is necessary to consider the preconditions to applying agility.
Finally, we consider the different ways in which lean and agile approaches
can be combined to meet the changing market needs, building on the ideas of
segmented supply chain strategy presented in Chapter 2. Lean and agile strate­
gies must be combined in order to meet changing customer needs in the most
efficient manner.

Key issues

This c h a p te r addresses tw o key issues:
1 Lean th in k in g : the principles of lean thinking to improve material flo w and
minimise waste w hilst ensuring customer value is delivered. C utting o ut waste in all
business processes. Simple, paperless systems versus central control.
2 The agile supply chain: the dimensions of the agile supply chain, and the envi­
ronments th a t favour agility. Agile practices: addressing the challenges of market
turbulence, rapid response logistics and m anaging low volum e products.

We acknowledge and are grateful for Corrado Cerruti's assistance with ex­
panding and improving the section on agility, in particular his research on agile
partnerships.


7.1 Lean thinking
Key issues: W hat are the implications of lean thinking principles for logistics? How
can lean thinking be applied to other business processes and w hat are the prac­
tices associated with it?

Lean thinking (Krafcik and MacDuffie, 1989) was the term used in the West to refer

to the just-in-time production methods used by Japanese automotive manufactur­
ers, such as the Toyota Production System, as discussed in Section 6.2. Suffering
shortages and lack of resources in the 1950s and 1960s, Japanese car manufactur­
ers responded by developing production processes that operated with minimum
waste. The term 'lean' was used in the West because production required less space,
resource and inventory due to the emphasis on minimising waste. However, waste
comes in many forms, as we shall see in the next section.

7.1.1 Types of waste
In Chapter 5 we saw how any activity that does not add value, but consumes
resource, is a form of waste. By mapping processes through the supply chain, it
is possible to sort value-adding and non-value-adding activities (transport, store,
inspect and delay). Lean thinking goes further by adding three more types of
'waste' to make seven in all. They are as follows:
• The waste o f overproduction: making or delivering too much, too early or 'just
in case'. Instead, the aim should be to make 'just-in-time' - neither too early
nor too late. Overproduction creates unevenness or lumpiness of material flow,
which is bad for quality and productivity. It is often the biggest source of waste.
• The waste o f waiting: takes place whenever time is not being used effectively. It
shows up as waiting by operators, by parts or by customers.
• The waste o f transporting: moving parts around from one process to the next
adds no value. Double handling, conveyors and movements by fork-lift truck
are all examples of this waste. Placing processes as close as possible to each
other not only minimises the waste of transport but also improves com m uni­
cations between them.
• The waste o f inappropriate processing: using a large, central process that is shared
between several lines (e.g. a heat treatm ent plant) is an example of this type of
waste. Another example is a process that is incapable of meeting quality stan­
dards demanded by the customer - so it cannot help making defects.
• The waste o f unnecessary inventory: inventory is a sign that flow has been dis­
rupted, and that there are inherent problems in the process. Inventory not only
hides problems, it also increases lead times and increases space requirements.
• The waste o f unnecessary motions: if operators have to bend, stretch or extend
themselves unduly, then these are unnecessary motions. Other examples
are walking between processes, taking a stores requisition for signature, and
decanting parts from one container into another.




• The waste o f defects: producing defects costs time and money. The longer a
defect remains undetected (e.g. if it gets into the hands of the end-customer),
the more cost is added. Defects are counteracted by the concepts of 'quality at
source' and 'prevention, not detection'.
Lean thinking invites us to analyse business processes systematically to estab­
lish the baseline of value-adding processes and identify the incidence of these
seven wastes. The aim is to get parts and data to flow through business processes
evenly and synchronously. The more detailed approach, prompted by the con­
cept of seven wastes, encourages a greater analysis and understanding of pro­
cesses and their relationships than is made by supply chain mapping.
Gradually, the principle of minimising waste spreads from the shop floor to all
manufacturing areas, and from manufacturing to new product development and
supply chain management. Thus the term lean thinking refers to the elimination
of waste in all aspects of a business and its supply chain.

7.1.2 The principles of lean thinking
Lean thinking is a cyclical route to seeking perfection by eliminating waste (the
Japanese word is muda) and thereby enriching value from the customer perspec­
tive. The end-customer should not pay for the cost, time and quality penalties of
wasteful processes in the supply network. Four principles are involved in achiev­
ing the fifth, seeking perfection (see Figure 7.1):
• specifying value;
• identifying the value stream;
• making value flow;
• pull scheduling.

Figure 7.1

Lean thinking principles

(Source: After Womack and (ones, 2003)


Principle 1: Specify value

Value is specified from the customer perspective. In Chapter 2 we discussed value
from the customer perspective. Value is added along the supply network as raw
materials from primary manufacture are converted progressively into finished
product bought by the end-customer, such as the aluminium ore being converted
into one of the constituents of a can of cola (see Chapter 1, Section 1.1). From a
marketing and sales perspective, the can of cola should be 'always within reach
of your thirst'. That is an attem pt to define value from the end-customer perspec­
tive. Another is Porter's concept of the value chain (Porter, 1985), which sees two
types of activity that are of value to the customer. The first is the primary value
activities of transforming raw materials into finished products, then distributing,
marketing and servicing them. The second is support activities, such as designing
the products, and the manufacturing and distribution processes needed to under­
pin primary activities.
Principle 2: Identify the value stream

Following on from the concept of value, the next principle is to identify the value
stream - the whole sequence of processes along the supply network. The prin­
ciples of time-based mapping are discussed in Section 5.4 and can be used to map
the current state and the future state of the value stream.
Principle 3: M ake value flow

In essence, this means eliminating the seven wastes, as identified earlier in
Section 7.1, and can be implemented by applying the pyramid of key factors that
we outlined in Section 6.2. Minimising delays, inventories, defects and downtime
supports the flow of value in the supply network. Simplicity and visibility are the
foundations to achieving these key factors.
Principle 4: Pull scheduling

Enforce the rules in Section 6.1: make only in response to a signal, that more
is needed, from the customer (the next process downstream). This implies that
demand information is made available across the supply chain. Where possible,
supply from manufacturing, not from stock. Where possible, use customer orders
not forecasts.
Principle S: Seek perfection

The fifth principle is achieved by getting better gradually at everything we do,
squeezing waste out at every step.
Many supply chains attem pt to apply the principles of lean thinking, and Case
study 7.1 provides a good example of a food supply chain applying these prin­
ciples in order to reduce waste and improve flow.




CASE STUDY

7.1

Improving value flow in Bernard Matthews' poultry supply chain
Almost a fifth of the UK's wheat crop goes into poultry feed and, although feed supply
chains are often short and integrated, there are opportunities to improve the perfor­
mance, even in these commodity chains. This was found to be the case during a project
examining value flow in the feed supply chain for Bernard Matthew's poultry farms,
shown in Figure 7.2.

Figure 7.2

Project scope from grain trading to point of delivery into poultry farms

Principle 1: Specify value
In a supply chain it is complex to understand value, since each participant in the
chain w ill have their own needs and expectations about w hat their internal or
external suppliers should deliver. However, by understanding value it is possible to
identify activity that does not add value and seek to reduce or eliminate it. A team
of four people from Bernard Matthews and Saxon constructed a map of value in the
supply chain (as shown in Figure 7.3) by analysing the value at each stage of the
process.
The value map was used to understand the impact of various activities on customer
value and to define non-value-adding activities. It is interesting to note that the value
proposition changes substantially as we go through the chain. Earlier stages focus mainly
on price and, to some degree, on quality and delivery, indicating the product's commod­
ity status. However, at the retailer and consumer end, the value proposition appears to be
considerably more complex, with the emergence of issues such as choice, brand, packag­
ing, innovation and promotions.



Figure 7.3

Value across the supply chain

Principle 2: Identify th e value stream
Both the information and product flows along the supply chain were analysed and the
time-based process map, shown in Figure 7.4, was produced.

Figure 7.4

Time-based process map from Saxon agricultural transport to Bernard

Matthews poultry farm




This diagram shows that there is a large proportion of non-value adding time (NVAT)
(97 per cent); however, most of this is storage time at various stages. The milling
activities are, in fact, very efficient, with an overall cycle time of around 15 minutes with
practically no interruptions.
Despite the large proportion of storage time, it is recognised that in this industry,
wheat has to be stored at some point in the process and that attempts to reduce stock
simply would result in moving it from one stage in the supply chain to another. The ques­
tion is not about how much inventory is held, but where is the optimal holding point.

Principle 3: Make value flow
Three main actions were identified to improve the value flow:

•

•

•

Improve communications. Details of inventory levels at the poultry farms were not
always visible and this created disruptions in orders and required schedule changes
at the mill, leading to unnecessary changeovers and wasted time.
Reduce delays and inefficiencies in transport. Transport of raw materials to the mill
was identified as an issue both in terms of cost and reliability. An analysis of empty
miles in the chain was proposed, particularly with a view to more extensive use of
backhauling. Standardisation of processes for loading and tipping would help to
improve waiting times.
Reduce the frequency o f grain sampling. Grain was being sampled by a number of
participants and on several occasions. The use of an independent sampling service
would help reduce the wasted time and effort associated w ith multiple sampling.

Questions

1 How m ight each of the improvement actions identified allow the reduction of inven­
tory at each of the three storage points identified (see Figure 7.4)?
2 Which stocking point may be optimal and why?

We continue this section by considering the way in which lean thinking can be
applied to enriching value in business processes other than manufacturing, where
it originated.

7.1.3 Application of lean thinking to business processes
Working back from the end-customer, a focal firm should consider the following
processes:
• order to replenishment;
• order to production;
• product development.
In each of these processes, the application of lean thinking involves examin­
ing the process, quantifying waste within it, identifying root causes of the waste,
and developing and implementing solutions. Examining the process involves


mapping it using a variety of techniques, such as flow charting, depending on the
nature of the process. Performance is quantified by taking measures of the differ­
ent kinds of waste. For a first attempt, using the time-based measures of lead time
and value-adding time often reveal the main incidences of waste. Having identi­
fied waste, lean thinking applies the problem-solving tools associated with total
quality control (TQC) to identify root causes and develop solutions.
The application of lean thinking is the means by which many companies bring their
processes under control. Following a systematic approach to tackling waste, they seek
to minimise defects, to minimise inventory and to maximise simplicity and visibility.
Order to replenishment

The order replenishment cycle concerns the time taken to replenish what has
been sold and assumes that a 'make to stock' approach is being used. Lean think­
ing seeks to manage the order replenishment cycle by replacing only what has
been sold within rapid replenishment lead times. Typically, a kanban approach to
material flow is used where a kanban quantity is defined - this is a fixed replen­
ishm ent quantity where the replenishment is initiated by the 'customer' of the
process sending back a kanban ticket.
Order to production

The order to production cycle assumes a 'make to order' approach and is the series
of steps that are followed to respond to an order, organise and undertake produc­
tion, and deliver the product to the customer. This 'make to order' process may be
contained within a company or can extend up the supply chain.
Product development

Product development delivers new products or services that can be sold. This pro­
cess is essential if an organisation is to have future success. Lean thinking can
be applied to this process to make it more effective by supporting the develop­
m ent of products with desirable attributes and features, whilst minimising time to
market. It can also make the process more efficient and ensure that products are
developed to cost. Beyond lean thinking, product development for agility, covered
in Section 7.2.2, can reduce further time to market, product development costs
and, ultimately, the costs inherent in the supply chain that delivers the product.

7.1.4 Lean manufacturing practices
Lean thinking is associated with a number of operational practices that help to
deliver the aim of waste minimisation. Two of the most significant are:
• small-batch production;
• rapid changeover.
These two practices are associated closely with each other, but are considered
separately here to aid clarity.




The target in small-batch production is a batch size of 1. The traditional logic
behind large batches is to take advantage of reduced costs through economies
of scale. The established approach to determining the appropriate batch size in
manufacturing is the economic batch quantity (EBQ) (see Section 6.1.2, which
is the optim um batch size that mitigates the trade-off between changeover costs
and inventory holding costs, given an average demand rate. This is a fair ap­
proach, as it considers both production costs and inventory costs. However, since
changeovers are typically lengthy and therefore costly, this pushes the EBQ up,
leading to large batch sizes, which result in a lack of flexibility. The rationale
behind small batches is that they can reduce total cost across a supply chain,
such as removing the waste of overproduction and excessive inventory. They help
to deliver products that the end-customer wants within the expected lead time
(D-time - Section 5.2).
The discussion above links changeover time to batch size - shorter changeovers
are lower cost and enable reduced batch sizes (i.e. EBQs). The contribution of
rapid changeover was shown graphically by the changeover of press tools used to
make car body panels. These cumbersome pieces of equipment can weigh up to
10 tonnes, and historically took up to 8 hours to change within the large presses.
The consequence of these long changeover times was that com ponent production
runs (batch sizes) were long, often going on for days before the press tools were
changed so that another component could be made. Extensive work, again pio­
neered by Toyota, was undertaken on press design, tooling design and component
design over a number of years to help reduce changeover times. The effect has
been to reduce changeover times for tools for large pressed parts to around five
minutes. Consequently, practices that reduce changeover times are often known
as single minute exchange o f dies (SMED, Shingo, 1988). The ability to undertake
rapid changeovers allows a batch of each different body panel to be produced
each day in line with current demand, instead of having to produce to forecast.
The lesson from the automotive industry is that even very large pieces of equip­
m ent can be developed to allow rapid changeovers. This effort may take a number
of years, and is reliant upon developments in machinery and product design. The
effect is to provide the flexibility to make possible small-batch production that
responds to customer needs.

7.2 The concept of agility
The 'agile supply chain' is essentially a practical approach to organising logistics
capabilities around changing end-customer demands. It is about moving from
supply chains that are structured around a focal company and its operations
(for example, Ford Production System) towards supply chains that are focused on
end-customers. Enabling the agile supply chain requires many significant chang­
es: as an example, consider the position of Li & Fung, the largest exporter of
textiles into the USA. The organisation coordinates manufacturers mainly across
Asia to supply major customers, such as Levi's, mostly in the USA (as described in
Case study 7.4). One of the key features of the Li & Fung approach is to establish
an organisation that is customer centric, rather th an being split into geographic


divisions that end up competing against each other for global customers. The
customer-focused divisions were separate profit-making units often dedicated to
serving one customer and lead by an entrepreneurial manager.
Mason-Jones et al. (1999) developed a helpful comparison between agile and
lean supply, shown in Table 7.1. We have extended this table into our comparison
of further characteristics of lean and agile supply, shown in Table 7.2.
There is no reason why there should be an 'either-or' approach to logistics strat­
egy. Thus, many supply chains can adopt a 'lean' capability up to a given down­
stream process, and then adopt an 'agile' capability thereafter. This enables high
productivity, low cost processes to start with, followed by responsive processes
to allow high levels of customisation thereafter. Such a strategic choice has been
referred to as Teagility' because it combines the benefits of both supply capabili­
ties. The concept of leagility is close to that of postponement, which we discuss
later in this chapter.
The comparisons in Tables 7.1 and 7.2 help us to place 'agile' in relation to
'lean', and thus to complement our earlier concept of logistics performance objec­
tives. In Table 1.1 (in Chapter 1), we considered the issue of competing through
logistics. The relative importance of the three logistics objectives (quality, time
and cost) can be assessed with the help of order winners and order qualifiers (see
Section 1.3.4). To actually win orders demands that performance of the focal firm
must be superior to that of its competitors, so that products win orders in the mar­
ketplace. The order winner provided by a lean supply chain is price as the focus is
on waste, and therefore cost minimisation, whereas the order winner enabled by
an agile supply chain is availability of the product, despite it being subject to vola­
tile demand. In fact, agility is typically appropriate either in the early stages of the
product life cycle - during the introduction and growth phase - or for products

So far we have focused on the differences between lean and agile. However,
there are similarities. Both lean and agile supply chains aspire to establishing
product flow synchronised with demand, but of course for lean supply chains
this is far simpler as demand is stable and predictable. As discussed under lean
practices, in Section 7.1.4, large batches lead to lack of flexibility in responding
to changes in demand volume or demand mix (the range of different product
variants). It therefore follows that small batch sizes are desirable for both lean and
agile supply chains to ensure product flow is synchronised with demand. How­
ever, the main drivers for small batches are different - lean requires reduced waste
(inventory, changeover time, etc.), whilst agility requires flexibility to changes in
demand.
Case study 7.2 compares and contrasts two supply chains for the same cured
fish product (bacalao) but that supply two different markets and employ different
strategies akin to lean and agile.

Bacalao - two supply chains for two markets
Bacalao is fish that has been salted and dried, traditionally in the open air on rocks;
today it is done in a drier. It has been produced in Norway since about 1640, can be
kept refrigerated for several years, and is said to improve over time. It has developed
a strong position in the food cultures of many Latin countries - such as Brazil, the Do­
minican Republic and Portugal - where consumers often follow the Catholic tradition of
eating more fish on Fridays and in the run-up to Easter. Marketing over many years has
created the association with Norway as 'the land of bacalao', or 'bacalhau da Noruega1,
as it is called. It is a matter of great pride amongst consumers to master a variety of
recipes for serving bacalao.
The overall supply chain is illustrated in Figure 7.5. It takes at least four weeks to make
the end-product. The best fish is wild and taken by line, but trawled fish is also good,
whilst nets give the lowest quality because the fish can be dead for a while before being

hauled up. Today, the fish is farmed increasingly as well. The raw material is the major
cost item: prices are set by the Råfiskelaget (the Norwegian raw fish association). Prices
can vary a lot - for example from NOK26/kg to NOK15/kg within a year. Electricity and
insurance are the other tw o major cost items. The fish is slaughtered (and bled on the
boat for the best quality), then matured in salt for two to three weeks. After salting, it is
dried, sorted, packed and distributed. There are no reliable ways of measuring salt and
water content, so manual methods of touching and feeling the fish during each stage
are used to ensure consistent quality and weight.
Bacalao is produced mainly from cod, which is preferred by Portuguese customers.
But consumers in the Dominican Republic prefer pollock, which is a darker-fleshed fish
that is more abundant in the North Atlantic. Cod is up to three times more expensive
than pollock. The Norwegian fish industry is highly fragmented, with many small-scale
fish farmers, fishermen and producers. Marketing activities are coordinated by the Nor­
wegian Seafood Export Council.
Consumers are very quality conscious when buying bacalao. Quality is deter­
mined by colour, texture and firmness, as well as water content and size. Portuguese
consumers prefer smaller cod, around 2.5 kilos, whilst consumers in the Dominican
Republic are less concerned with size. Note that quality here refers to grade of fish rather
than to conformance quality: both grades are fit for purpose in the markets they serve.
Bacalhau da N oruega
Company Noruega (CN) has 150 employees, and built its bacalao production facility in
1997 in the Port of Ålesund - which has one of the largest harbours in Norway and one
of the most modern fishing fleets in Europe. The company focuses on volume in order
to benefit from the economies of scale. Production is stabilised through the year by
ensuring a stable supply of fish through sourcing a combination of frozen and fresh fish,
creating a buffer of some three to four months' supply. The company trades only in full
truckloads, which are distributed via Hamburg or Rotterdam. Product is sold under the
generic brand name of Bacalao da Noruega in standard transport packaging. Whilst CN
serves most Latin markets, 80 per cent of its sales go to the Dominican Republic as pol­
lock bacalao. This market is relatively stable throughout the year, which matches CN's
stable production policy. CN is experimenting w ith pollock farming further to improve
supply reliability.

Bacalao Superior
Company Superior (CS) is also based in the Ålesund area, and accounts for
15-20 per cent of Norwegian bacalao exports to Portugal. Only cod bacalao is ex­
ported to this market, which commands a 10-15 per cent price premium over other
Norwegian bacalao. The product is popular w ith consumers, which creates a strong
relationship w ith the single supermarket chain that sells it. Fish are sold whole, w ith
a CS tag showing guarantee of origin from fresh Norwegian cod, which was an
idea that came from the supermarket customer. This ensures that CS bacalao stands
out from other offerings, jo in t marketing campaigns are funded by both CS and its
supermarket customer, and include TV promotions. Only fresh cod is used in bacalao
superior, caught by the coastal fleet in small boats. During the winter, supply is heavily


dependent on quotas that are permitted in the famous Lofoten fishing field in the far
north. CS buys from three fresh cod suppliers, and from 15-20 suppliers of salt fish.
Processing follows traditional routes, but some technology has been introduced into
cutting and drying. Finished product is transported to Portugal in 22-tonne truck­
loads three times per week. Storage of finished product is in Lisbon at the customer's
warehouse.

CN accepts more variation in its raw material source to enable continuous supply. This
applies to type of fish as well as where and how it is caught. Farming and a healthy stock
of frozen fish help to reduce further supply variations. On the other hand, CS seeks the
best quality w ith minimum variation. The only inbound stock that is permitted is small
quantities of salted cod.
Whilst the raw materials and end-product have many similarities, there are substantial
differences in inbound and outbound logistics as well as processing and distribution
strategies. These differences are fundamental to the need to support the brand (rais­
ing consumer expectations) by means of logistics strategy (meeting consumer expecta­
tions). We can conclude as follows:
•

Two fundamentally different inbound strategies: CN focuses on secure, continuous
supply and accepts greater variation in terms of type of fish, where and how caught so farming is encouraged. They buffer and store extensively. CS goes for consis­
tently high quality by not accepting much by way of variation: size, line catching
and location are all im portant requirements. They do not store fresh fish or use
frozen.




•

Internally consistent marketing and logistics: CN matches the low price, continuous
availability marketing mix by means of efficient sourcing and continuous availability,
and of 'lean' production and distribution methods. This enables high and consistent
production volumes supported by a flexible product mix. There is less to go wrong
in terms of supply, but the generic nature of the product works against better mar­
gins or customer loyalty. CS matches the high price, seasonal availability marketing
mix by means of highly selective sourcing and by focused factory production that
is seasonal and relatively inefficient. Production is possible only when high-quality,
line-caught fresh fish are available. Limited and sporadic availability mean that the
product has to reassert itself following supply interruptions, so the marketing pull
must be consistent and strong. Traceability through tagging reinforces the superior
quality image in consumers' minds, supported by joint marketing w ith the major
retail customer.

The way that the two supply chains have evolved illustrates the trade-offs at stake:
more of one thing means less of another. The CS supply chain has become focused on
top quality (grade) product, but at relatively high cost and sporadic availability. The CN
supply chain has become focused on the opposite: low cost and continuous availability,
but at average quality (grade).

Question

1 Discuss and evaluate to what extent Company Noruega (CN) has a lean supply chain
and Company Superior (CS) has an agile supply chain.

There is no reason why there should be an 'either-or' approach to logistics strat­
egy. Lean and agile can be combined in different ways (as described in Section 7.3).
Further, as discussed in Section 2.5.2, agility costs more. Wherever possible, the
supply chain should be lean and waste minimised. However, to respond to volatile
demand, capacity and inventory buffers are required.
Agility is defined in m any w ays but it is understood that it centres on b ein g able to
com pete and prosper w ith in a state of dynam ic change, w h ich involves tw o aspects:
responding to changes (anticipated or unanticipated) in proper ways and due time;
ex p loitin g changes and taking advantage o f changes as opportunities.
(Source: Zhang and Sharifi, 2007)

Zhang and Sharifi (2007) go on to define a taxonomy based on three types of agility:
1 capability to satisfy and be close to customers;
2 capability to thrive in changes that may be anticipated, e.g. seasonality,
promotions;
3 capability to cope with unanticipated changes, e.g. disruption in supply, com­
petitor product introductions.
W hether changes are anticipated or not depends on the organisation's predic­
tive capabilities in terms of sales forecasting (as covered in 'Demand Profiling',
Section 2.3), risk m anagement (see Section 4.5) and market research.



Figure 7.6

Model of agile capabilities

(Source: After van Hoek, et. al., 2001)

Compatible with this view is an earlier understanding of agile capabilities (van
Hoek et al., 2001), which defines agility as the capability to read and respond to
changing end-customer demand and identifies four distinct capabilities that are
required, as shown in Figure 7.6:
• Market sensitive. Organisation requires a strong ability to 'read' the market,
both in terms of demand for existing products and services and new, hitherto
undefined, products and services. This requires strength in terms of market
research and being close to the customer.
• Process integration. The supply chain can be viewed as a system of business
processes, which, if integrated and synchronised (as described in Section 8.1),
can avoid the time, cost and quality penalties associated with 'stand-alone'
processes. For example, where the com ponent delivery process is not synchro­
nised with the manufacturing process, the penalty will be a high inbound com­
ponent inventory.
• Network based. A network of supply chain partners collaborate to meet the endcustomer needs and demand by collaboratively planning across the supply
chain. In the case of Li & Fung they configured and orchestrated the whole
supply network, as described in Case study 7.4. The competitive strength is
gained through focusing the distinct capabilities provided by each company
on the end-customer needs.




• Virtual integration. This depends on capturing electronic point of sale (EPOS)
demand data and sharing it across the supply chain, such that member com­
panies see the 'real time' demand, rather than the distorted picture of demand
provided by sales forecasts. This reduces the level of inventory required to buf­
fer against the inaccurate sales forecasts, thus replacing inventory with demand
data. However, the proviso here is that even the EPOS data is past demand from
the m om ent it is generated, as opposed to future dem and (such as customer
future orders) so, when we refer to sharing 'real time' demand data, it is more
like the 'latest available' demand data, which can improve forecast accuracy.
Now we have an understanding of the capabilities required for agility, it is time
to further consider the practices that will enable these capabilities. However, there
are a wide range of practices and:
Different organisations experience different sets o f changes, and different levels o f
pressure resulting from the changes, and therefore w ou ld require different com b i­
n ations o f practices and tolls to cope w ith the changes.
(Source: Zhang and Sharifi, 2000)

Through the rest of Section 7.2 we will consider a selection of agile practices
concerned with:
• planning;
• product design;
• manufacturing; and
• supply partnerships.
This will culminate in a consideration of three preconditions for agility.

7.2.1

Sales and operations planning for agility
Forecasting is not just a numbers game, it is a key business process that supports
supply chain readiness for market demand. As im portant as fast response may
be for agility, organisations cannot make all of their operational decisions in real
time and in response to events already taking place. Some advanced preparation
and planning is required. Hence, even in the most agile supply chains, forecast­
ing is needed and can be used to avoid, for example, expensive panic shipments
against orders that could have been anticipated.
Sales and operations planning (S&OP) is an integrated business management pro­
cess developed in the 1980s by Oliver Wight, which encourages medium-term fore­
casting from both a demand and supply perspective. The purpose of the sales and
operations planning module (S&OP, described in Section 6.1.1) is to set demand
(in terms of orders and sales forecasts for existing and new products) and to translate
them into operations plans for sourcing, making, storing and delivering to demand.
S&OP requires internal integration (which is further discussed in Section 8.1.1)
to make the process work, at least between sales, marketing and operations and
ideally with product development and finance. However, these functional areas
traditionally specialise in portions of the planning activities, which results in
conflicts in expectations. Oliva and Watson (2011) show that the S&OP process
can achieve integration, rather than requiring it in the first place, and this is


despite formal functional incentives (such as performance-related pay). Further,
it is widely acknowledged that companies that implement S&OP successfully can
meet customer demands at the highest levels with reduced lead times for orders
and time-to-launch for new products, whilst m aintaining reduced inventories and
minimising supply chain operating costs (for example Lapide, 2004; Bower,
2006). However, many companies do not realise these benefits because S&OP is
not implemented properly (Wallace, 2013).
In her lectures, Godsell (2006) provides a good example of an S&OP process
at Coru s Group plc, a multinational steel-making company, now wholly owned
by Tata Steel. The schematic in Figure 7.7 shows how the S&OP is positioned at
a tactical level. So it is not concerned with the day-to-day, week-to-week opera­
tions, but instead provides governance in line with the corporate strategy (across
products, marketing and operations) with a horizon of up to 24 months.

Figure 7.7

Overview of the Corus S&OP process

(Source: Godsell, 2006)

So what makes the S&OP process successful? Lapide (2004) identifies 12 success
factors:
1 Ongoing routine S&OP meetings. These typically are held monthly and a series of
meetings are conducted on a strict monthly timetable. For example, establishing:
a an unconstrained demand plan and forecast;
b draft or rough-cut supply plan and a constrained demand plan;

c the final alignment of the demand and supply plans.




2 Structured meeting agenda. Since the meetings are routine, they should have
a fixed agenda. Typically, they last two to four hours or even longer. They
should include a review of how well previous plans were met, including a root
cause analysis of any plan variances. Once alignment is established between
demand and supply side then the finalised plans can be published in the busi­
ness, fostering a 'single plan' planning environment.
3 Pre-work to support meeting inputs. An unconstrained baseline demand forecast
and rough-cut demand and supply plans need to be brought into the S&OP
meetings. These need to be aggregated, synthesised and translated for m an­
agement prior to the meetings, so there is a lot of homework that needs to be
done. Figure 7.8 illustrates the preparation steps Coru s follows for its S&OP
meeting.

Figure 7.8

Pre-work to support meetings at Coru s

(Source: Godsell, 2006)

4 Cross-functional participation. S&OP process is cross-functional, involving
demand-side managers from sales, marketing and customer service and supplyside managers from procurement, manufacturing and logistics. In addition,
finance and product development/engineering are highly relevant.
5 Participants empowered to make decisions. All attendees need to come with real
decision-making authority and mandate for the meeting to become effective.
6 An unbiased, responsible organisation to run a disciplined process. S&OP needs
to be conducted as a repeatable process that runs on-time and according to a
schedule in a disciplined way.
7 Internal collaborative process leading to a consensus and accountability.
8 An unbiased baseline forecast to start the process. The baseline forecast is
important because it forms the working draft from which S&OP participants


develop final supply and demand plans. As such it should be unbiased,
unconstrained and incorporate all known impacts on future demand. Typi­
cally, it is developed using statistical forecasting methods.
9 Joint supply and demand planning to ensure balance. Most S&OP processes tend
to presume that the sales and marketing plans are fixed and that it is the
supply plans that need to change. This leads to a num ber of problems, for
example, it hides potential revenue opportunities that could take advantage
of excess supply capacities. In one case, the operations director of a leading
global oil company commented that in Italy they typically promote lubricant
oil in September, but the raw material suppliers have been on holiday for the
last two months, leading to a poor response to the inflated demand. It would
be better if merchandising would liaise with supply chain on their promotion
plans and schedule them when there is an excess of product, ideally available
at lower cost to ensure good profit margins.
10 M easurement o f the process. The m ost im portant metric to track is dem and
forecast accuracy to ensure forecast errors are diagnosed and accuracy
improved in the future. This implies th at the individuals generating the
forecasts should be held accountable. Most often, sales forecast demand,
but they have limited incentives to drive forecast accuracy as they don't
have to live w ith the consequences - indeed under-forecasting could make
it easier to hit sales targets. To help improve the S&OP process, other
metrics should be m onitored, such as adherence to sales, m arketing and
operations plans.
11 Supported by integrated supply - demand planning technology. Many S&OP process­
es are supported by a myriad of spreadsheets or by separate demand forecasting
and resource planning applications. W hat is important is that the software al­
lows the demand- and supply-side views to be brought together.
12 External inputs to the process. In addition to internal supply-demand data (e.g.
customer orders, on-hand inventory), external information from customers
(e.g. point of sale retail data) and suppliers (e.g. consignment stocks) should
be incorporated into the plans.
Whilst the above 12 success factors may seem clear and sensible, m any compa­
nies have found that it is still not easy to derive value, in terms of increased profit,
from S&OP. A leading global oil company implemented S&OP in 2004 but found
that it became a 'tick box' process and did not deliver increased value. They have
now introduced a series of value levers, which ultimately focus on increasing the
average profit margin across their product range. During the S&OP process, this
provides visibility of a product's profitability, giving prominence to those that are
more profitable and triggering a supply review of those that fall below a profit­
margin threshold.
Alcoa, one of the world's largest producers of aluminium, has made some great
strides across diverse businesses that are autonomous in their markets, to develop
a boundary-spanning S&OP process. Particularly noteworthy is that they forecast
by market, not by business unit. Alcoa realised that a lot of its businesses were
supplying the same markets, with all of them developing their own forecast often hugely varying - based upon a view limited to one business. So they formed




so-called market-sector lead teams that operate across businesses, by market, to
come up with one forecast for where that market is going based upon a more
comprehensive view of the market.
Tom Wallace is a Distinguished Fellow at Ohio State University and has spe­
cialised over the last 35 years in S&OP. He considers what the future holds for
S&OP (Wallace, 2013) and concludes that:
S&OP is here to stay; it'll get better and better; and w ill at som e p o in t in the future
be w id ely accepted as the standard set o f processes w ith w h ich to run a business.
N eglect it at your peril!

S&OP provides the overall governance for the business, sometimes referred to
as the integrated business management. However, crucial to a company's success is
the product it offers, so now we'll consider the approaches to developing prod­
ucts for agility.

7.2.2 Product design for agility
Agile supply chains are a response to shortening product life cycles, typical
of fashion products, and proliferating product variants. Equally, agile supply
chains must respond to unanticipated changes in dem and due to technologi­
cal or environm ental changes, as illustrated by a leading global oil company
supplying marine oil for large freight ships. The engines powering these enor­
mous vessels burn considerable oil on every long trip and therefore top-ups are
required in each port. Following the financial crisis of 2008, and subsequent
global recession, freight ships reduced their speeds to improve fuel consum p­
tion. However, an unexpected consequence of this behaviour was an increase in
oil consum ption. Effectively, the oil was not designed for the new slow speeds.
A new marine oil was developed quickly that was appropriate for the slower
speeds and, ironically, drew on an old technology from days w hen ships were
slower.
Crucial to achieving market sensitivity necessary for agility is the capability to
develop products quickly and efficiently - time to market must be short or the
product will have been superseded before it is available or the competition will
have cornered the market! But, just as im portant as the time to market, is produc­
tion cost and speed. Both these goals can be achieved through product develop­
m ent being coordinated with supply chain design (manufacturing, sourcing and
logistics).
Unfortunately, far from being a coordinated process of product and sup­
ply chain design, supply chain considerations, such as com ponent sourcing
and manufacturing location, are often afterthoughts. As Ellram et al. (2008)
observed, there is a lack of inclusion of supply chain decisions in product design,
despite the fact that 75 per cent of life cycle costs are determined by product
specification (Balasubramanian, 2001). This can lead to higher purchasing costs,
excessive transportation and unresponsive supply chains that fail to meet endcustomer needs. Here we will discuss a num ber of approaches to product design
for agility.


Design for m anufacture an d assembly

Recognition of the criticality of coordinating product design and manufactur­
ing process design decisions has led to 'design for manufacture and assembly'
(Boothroyd et al., 1994). This involves the careful consideration of com ponent
manufacture and assembly early in the product design cycle, reducing the num ­
ber of components, materials and assembly steps where possible. It thereby reduc­
es the time to market and the production costs through simplification of design.
Concurrent engineering (CE)

Concurrent engineering (CE) requires that the related functions, such as product
design, manufacturing and logistics, work concurrently on the product design
rather than the 'over the wall' approach. It is renowned for reducing time to
market.
Design for supply chain (or design for logistics)

The aim is to keep the product in a 'vanilla' (or generic) form for as long as pos­
sible in the manufacturing process by delaying product differentiation. Indeed
it is sometimes referred to as delayed product differentiation and, as we shall see in
Section 7.2.3, it is important to enable the application of form postponement.
Lee (1993 and 1995) develops ideas in this area and identifies three main ap­
proaches to design for supply chain or logistics:
• Product and process modularisation (Ulrich, 1994; Pine, 1993). Ulrich (1994)
claims that, 'a completely modular design embodies a one-to-one correspon­
dence between each functional element and physical component, in which ev­
ery interaction between components is critical to the function of the system'.
The idea is that many product variants can be assembled from a relatively nar­
row range of modules. Pine (1993) identifies six different types of modularity
(as shown in Figure 7.9). 'Com ponent swapping' is the complement of 'com ­
ponent sharing' and is where different components are paired with the same
basic product, creating as many products as there are components to swap.
In many cases the distinction between com ponent sharing and com ponent
swapping is a matter of degree. Consider Swatch watches: are the basic watch
elements a com ponent shared across all the range of watches (component shar­
ing) or are the watch parts the basic product and the incredible variety of face
styles the components (component swapping)? Com ponent swapping is asso­
ciated often with the creation of product variety as perceived by the customer,
as we will see later in the Smart Car Case study 7.3.
• Product and process standardisation (Erixon, 1996). This involves standardising
and rationalising components across the product range. Ultimately this leads
to a standardised product.
• Process re-sequencing (Lee and Tang, 1998), such that the differentiating prod­
ucts are postponed. Benetton provides the classic example when the dyeing
and knitting processes were swapped, such that the jumpers were knitted out
of natural yarn and then dyed when more accurate sales forecasts were available.

Dyeing is the main differentiating process - think of the colours of Benetton so, by delaying it until after the lengthy knitting process, it radically reduced
forecast horizon for jumpers by colour.

Three-dimensional concurrent engineering (3DCE)

Fine (1998) effectively brings together concurrent engineering (CE) and de­
sign for supply chain by proposing the extension of CE to supply chain design
in an approach termed three-dimensional concurrent engineering (3DCE). Fine's
framework for 3DCE proposes that only those activities that fall into the over­
laps between product, manufacturing process and supply chain design need to
be undertaken concurrently by the integrated product team. Many authors cite
coordinated product and supply chain design as an area requiring further
research. Rungtusanatham and Forza (2005) claim that:
D espite the undeniable appeal and im portance o f coordinating decisions across
product, m anufacturing process and supply ch ain design to b oth science and prac­
tice, w e k n ow very little about h ow to do so to m axim ise operational, supply chain
and firm performance.

They find that coordinating product and supply chain design decisions
improves performance in terms of reducing supply chain costs and improving
customer service.


7.2.3 Manufacturing for agility
Agility - responding to changes and exploiting changes - requires responsive
and flexible manufacturing, which can be adapted quickly to new products and
accommodate changes in mix (range of variants) and volume of production with
m inim um cost or time penalties. Allocation of finished goods to given customer
orders is a familiar way of responding quickly to demand - for example, selling
cars from a dealer forecourt. But this approach to supply means that inventories
of finished goods must be built up first - made-to-stock (MTS). The problem is
that they must be built up in anticipation of unknown demand, which depends
on accurate forecasts. If stocks pushed by a manufacturer onto its dealer network
are too high, they will have to be discounted. If they are too low, sales are lost
to competitors. Reducing the risks of speculative manufacture by delaying the
exact specification of the car until the customer order is known, and then deliv­
ering it within an acceptable D-time, is called form postponement. The concept of
'postponem ent' now is increasingly widely employed by organisations in a range
of industries (van Hoek, 2001). Form postponem ent is widely used to improve
responsiveness, and is defined (Skipworth and Harrison, 2004) as:
The delay, u n til custom er orders are received, of the final part o f the transform a­
tion processes, through w h ich the num ber o f SKUs proliferates, and for w h ich on ly
a short tim e period is available. The postponed transform ation processes m ay be
m anufacturing processes, assem bly processes, configuration processes, packaging
or labelling processes.

For example, the aim of the 'three-day car' project is to complete paint, trim,
final assembly and delivery of a car to dealer within three days (Holweg and
Miemczyck, 2003). However, many less ambitious form postponem ent applica­
tions delay packaging, labelling, adding documentation or product peripherals,
all of which are frequently conducted in distribution centres. Further, the post­
poned process may take place even further downstream, such as paint mixing in
DIY retailers, where the customer can choose almost any shade of any colour and
the 'vanilla' paint is mixed with a customised combination of pigments to give
the precise colour required.
The customer order decoupling p o in t an d form postponement

There are two main types of postponement, as illustrated in Figure 7.10, which
are distinguished by the location of the customer order decoupling point (CODP),
the point in the value-adding process where a product is linked to a specific cus­
tomer order. Therefore, downstream from this point production is order-driven
and upstream it is forecast-driven (Hoekstra and Romme, 1992). As we discussed
in Section 5.2 on P:D ratios, for MTO the production process is entirely orderdriven and the CODP is positioned before the beginning of the first transforma­
tion process. In contrast, for MTS the entire production process is forecast-driven,
because the CODP is located after the end of the last transformation process. In
the case of form postponem ent (FPp), the CODP is at the semi-finished product
stage, where the product, or com ponent modules, are in a generic form, as shown
in Figure 7.10, thus mitigating the weaknesses of MTO and MTS by enabling




a high variety or customised product to be provided on a short lead time with
m inim um (and generic) inventory. The other type of postponem ent - logisti­
cal postponem ent - is in essence MTS, where only the distribution is postponed
until the receipt of an order. Thus it is akin to centralisation of inventory in, say,
a Central European distribution centre.

Figure 7.10

A schematic showing form and logistical postponement

(Source: Skipworth and Harrison, 2004)

Conceptual model for form posptonement

Form postponem ent relies on the product being designed for the supply chain
(as explained in Section 7.2.2) such that the appearance of wider customer choice
can be created whilst the basic design of the product is the same. The Smart Car
Case study 7.3 is an excellent example of this. The conceptual model of form
postponement, shown in Figure 7.11, illustrates how it can be applied by bring­
ing together the product/process design and the CODP.
The model is based upon a production variety funnel (PVF, New, 1993), which
represents graphically the number of distinct parts that occur at each manufac­
turing stage. The vertical axis represents the num ber of items, the horizontal axis
throughput time. The PVF is hypothetical, yet typical of FPp applications, and
shows how a relatively limited range of components can be assembled into a wide
range of finished products. The CODP should be located at a point of differentia­
tion where there are relatively few generic components to be stored, reducing the
risk and cost associated with inventory.
The benefits of form postponem ent are rooted in the fact that it mitigates the
trade-offs between MTS and MTO, enabling a customised or high variety product
to be manufactured with both a short order lead time (D-time) compared to MTO



Figure 7.11

A conceptual model for form postponement

(Source: Skipworth and Harrison, 2004)

and a low inventory value compared to MTS. This allows a better match between
supply and demand. However, our research (Harrison and Skipworth, 2008) shows
that there are many obstacles to successful application of form postponement:
• Product design: the extent to which it is possible to standardise the product to
give only a small num ber of generic base products or modules. This is depen­
dent on the demand for the different product varieties as well as the product
characteristics themselves.
• Manufacturing planning and control: mindsets associated with MTO and MTS are
inhibitors to FPp, an aspect of the lack of structural and cultural fit referred to
by Yang et al. (2004). MTO and MTS tend not to require either manufacturing
planning or manufacturing processes to be responsive in the way that FPp does.
• Postponed process capacity: if this is insufficient it may not be possible to m ain­
tain the required responsiveness in terms of short, reliable order lead times
(D-time).
One final point on the application of form postponement: it is not always cus­
tomer orders that are used to drive the postponed differentiation processes. In
some supply chains, particularly retail chains, it is a sales forecast based on the
latest electronic point of sale (EPOS) data. But the form postponem ent principle
is the same - differentiation of the product is delayed until the latest possible
m om ent when more accurate demand data is available.
Now we will consider the Smart Car case study presented below, which illus­
trates the use of product 'design for logistics', manufacturing approaches for agil­
ity and the challenges of entering new geographic markets.




Smart Cars - customisation using the same basic design
Micro Compact Car AG (MCC), a wholly owned subsidiary of Daimler-Benz (formerly a
joint venture of Daimler-Benz and Swatch), is the company behind the Smart Car. The
Smart City Coupé is a 2-seater car measuring 2.5 metres in length, which promotes
individual m obility in cities, whilst minimising environmental impact - it requires only
half a normal parking space, it is fully recyclable after use and is powered by a relatively
small fuel-efficient engine.

Smart Car concept
The Smart Car is a modular design based on a rigid integral body frame or safety cell
(called 'TRIDION'), to which external body panels - doors, the front and rear panels are attached. The customer can customise the product by combining two colours of the
frame (black and silver) with the various colours of the external body panels plus internal
trim panels and comfort features, not to mention the size and type of engine. This way
the customer is given the impression of a high level of choice, although the car is the
same basic design, and variation in the manufacturing process is kept to a minimum.
All the customisable parts, with the exception of the engine and the body frame, can
be changed through the life of the car at the Smart Centres (the small city dealerships
where the cars are sold), allowing the customer easily to repair damage to the car and
refresh 'the look' like a fashion item.

Smartville and the supply chain
The Smart Car is manufactured at a purpose-built manufacturing site called 'Smartville'
in Hambach (France), with 20 production buildings covering 68 hectares. The seven
main module suppliers (plus a number of second-tier suppliers) designed their own
modules and invested in dedicated manufacturing facilities, fully integrated with MCC's
cross-shaped assembly flow line (as shown in Figure 7.12). The single-stage delivery

Figure 7.12

concept allows Smart Centres to procure their cars - via the sales logistics department directly from the manufacturing plant in Hambach instead of through a dealer or import
organisation. This distribution system is very different to the tiered sales structure in
the traditional automotive industry, in which national sales organisations and importers
add another layer between dealers and the manufacturer. This resulted in just a two- or
three-week lead time for a made to 'specific customer order' Smart Car, whilst, at the
time of the Smart launch, VW had a lead time of up to six months on some models customers could have what was in stock now, or wait!
As can be seen from Figure 7.13, the manufacturing lead time is seven days with a fur­
ther week or tw o allowed for distribution. The order from the Smart Centre is translated
into orders for the first- and second-tier suppliers, triggering manufacturing to order up
the supply chain. When material has arrived, the modules are supplied in sequence for
final assembly by a small number of first-tier suppliers on a one- to three-hour lead time.
Final assembly takes just five hours.

Figure 7.13

Smart Car manufacturing lead time

Initial launch in 1998
In 1998, when production was launched, employment across the site started with
1,500 (only 650 on the MCC payroll), but was expected to rise to 2,200 as the Smart
concept took off: the targeted capacity for the year 2000 was 200,000 vehicles a
year (or 750 a day). Following a host of teething problems and poor sales (sales in
1999 were half the targeted 120,000), a cost reduction project was pursued in 1999,
securing 15 per cent reduction in component costs - 60 per cent of that came from
suppliers.
Annual production at Smartville has never come close to the envisaged capacity of
200,000 vehicles (as shown by Table 7.4), in spite of the recession and the soaring price
of fuel, which should have favoured the brand. A number of variants on the original
ForTwo model were produced - ForFour, ForTwo Cabrio and the Roadster - however
they were all discontinued, leaving Smart a single-model brand.

Launch into America
When launched into North America in 2008, sales peaked at about 29,000, but have
since fallen from approximately 18,000 (2009) to just 9,000 in 2010. At the start of the
Smart Car production it was envisaged that global capacity would be expanded by repli­
cating the Smartville site anywhere in the world, however sales did not justify such invest­
ment. Therefore, Smart Cars were made in Smartville (France) and shipped to America.
In March 2007 a $99 reservation programme was launched, but Smart Cars were not
planned to be produced for the American market until 2008. This necessitated a long
wait for customers and many did not follow through w ith a purchase.

Questions
1 What could be the rationale behind the decision to conduct the final assembly at the
plant in Hambach when the modular product concept would allow product customi­
sation in the dealer channel at the Smart Centres?
2 Why m ight the lead time (D-time) be long for US Smart Car customers, considering
that sales are still a long way below the capacity of 200,000 vehicles per year?
3 How could Smart improve the lead time (D-time) for cars delivered into the USA
(without establishing a completely new assembly plant) and what are the associated
supply chain issues?
4 Supply partnerships are important to agility but, given the turbulent nature of agile
supply chains, what type of partnerships can be established?

7.2.4 Supply chain partnerships for agility
Relationships could be described as the critical success factor of many agile supply
chains, which are dependent on a network of supply chain partners that collaborate
to meet the end-customer needs by making available their resources to each other.
Earlier in this chapter we compared lean and agile, indicating that fluid clusters
(such as the supply networks in Section 8.6) - that are frequently reconfigured - are
required in agile supply chains, whereas lean supply chains depend on long-term
stable partnerships. However, herein lies a paradox: on the one hand agile supply
chain relationships can be described as highly involved strategic partnerships, but
on the other hand they are frequently reconfigured, which suggests a short-term
relationship. This is contrary to the conventional (stable ) strategic partnerships
(described in Sections 8.3 and 8.4), which are expected to have a long duration, in
part due to the investment of resource (time and effort) required to establish them
and, indeed, the cost of terminating such a relationship.


Agile versus stable supply partnerships

Literature describing agile supply partnerships (high involvement, short term,
HI-ST) highlights four characteristics that contribute to overcoming the apparent
paradox of partnerships in an agile supply chain. They:
1 are part of a portfolio of both short-term and long-term high-involvement
relationships;
2 have project-based features with a clear shared and common goal to be com­
pleted within a given time frame, e.g. large construction projects (Gadde and
Dubois, 2010);
3 are developed, starting from a group of pre-qualified suppliers with whom the
company is collaborating intensively on a recurrent, if not necessarily continu­
ous, basis (Christopher et al., 2004); and
4 are supported by organisational procedures and information technology (IT)
tools aimed at creating a standard platform for supply relationship manage­
ment, to reduce the loss of administrative and operational efficiencies related
to a supplier change (Baramichai, Zimmers and Marangos, 2007).
Studying the fashion industry, which requires agility due to its short life cycles,
high volatility and low predictability, Cerruti (2013) investigated the types and
characteristics of supply partnerships to achieve agility. He proposed a supply
partnership portfolio model, shown in Figure 7.14, which defines four types of
relationships on the basis on two dimensions: degree of involvement and dura­
tion of the supply relationship.

Figure 7.14

Supply relationships portfolio model

(Source: Cerruti, 2013)

Here, a high degree of involvement, between a footwear manufacturer and its
suppliers of leather and soles, is related to inter-firm knowledge-sharing routines,
investment in relation-specific assets and a trust-based governance mechanism
(as shown in Table 7.5). An example is the collaboration required to design a high
and thin heel for women's shoes, providing an aggressive fashion look but also
the required stability. The time frame of the relationship is evaluated in relation

to the industry clock speed (Fine, 1998). So, for instance, in the fashion industry, the
clock speed is related to the development and delivery of the seasonal fashion col­
lections, normally two collections per year (Spring/Summer and Autumn/Winter).
Therefore, Cerruti (2013) considered a supply relationship with an uninterrupted
sequence of purchasing orders for more than four seasons to be 'long-term'.
This matrix covers the familiar arm's-length relationships (low-involvement and
short-term) and stable supply partnerships (high-involvement and long-term). In
addition, it also defines two further options: durable arm's-length relationships
(low-involvement and long-term) and agile supply partnerships (high-involvement
and short-term). Durable arm's-length relationships are distant relationships m ain­
tained over a long period of time, which 'minimise procurement (transaction) costs;
allow suppliers to maximise economies of scale, which is critical...; and maintain
vigorous competition' (Dyer et al., 1998). Agile supply partnerships, whilst poten­
tially shortlived, are not created by chance, or in an extemporary way, but are the
result of deliberate investments (as to IT infrastructure, organisational procedures
and/or supplier pre-qualification) aimed at acquiring future degrees of freedom.
Supply partnerships required for agile supply chains

In agile supply chains, both stable and agile supply partnerships are required, but
what are the criteria for determining the suitable approach? Cerruti (2013) found
that the type of strategic supply partnership (stable long-term or agile short­
term) is dependent on the characteristics of the component/service (the extent
to which it is impacted by the fashion look) and on the degree of turbulence an
agile strategy is designed to face.
Cerruti (2013) studied footwear companies, and their suppliers, in the MacerataFermo district, the largest footwear district in Italy. Footwear companies consider
agile supply partnerships for categories of supply materials that are sensitive to
the fashion trends, such as the leather upper on shoes. They can have 25-30 dif­
ferent leather upper suppliers every season, changing and adding them in order


to get a fashion 'look' in line with the expected market trend or simply to provide
more variety. These materials are difficult to be sourced in a stable way - season
after season - from the same suppliers.
The use of agile supply partnerships is particularly strong in the case of foot­
wear companies that:
• are subject to high-turbulence agility drivers: a high proportion of each sea­
sonal collection was renewed; and
• had developed strong agile capabilities: a local, as opposed to remote, supply
network and postponed purchase orders.
In an agile supply chain, strategic supply partnerships, whether agile or
stable, aim to focus the distinct capabilities provided by each company on the endcustomer. Nowhere do you see this done more successfully than at Li & Fung,
who configure and coordinate agile supply chains.

CASE STUDY

7.4

Li & Fung - configuring the agile supply chain
Li & Fung is a Hong Kong based company that was established in the early 1900s as a
mediator between Chinese speaking sellers and English speaking buyers. A century later
it is one of the world's leading textile exporters (the largest into the USA) and generates
a turnover of US$16 billion (2010), 70 per cent of which is from the US and European
markets (2011). Soft goods, such as apparel, account for about 70 per cent of sales,
whilst hard goods (e.g. toys, footwear and beauty) make up the rest.

A global supply network
By 2012 Li & Fung had established a global network of 240 sourcing offices across
40 economies and now employs 27,000 people. This enables it to configure and co­
ordinate a vast global supply network across Europe, USA, Asia and Southern Africa,
including 15,000 regular suppliers. It configures the entire supply chain (as shown in
Figure 7.15) for its clients, which include household brands like Disney, Levi's and Reebok.
Depending upon the client requirement, it begins with product design, using an in-depth

Figure 7.15

The supply chain processes that Li & Fung configure and coordinate




understanding of consumer needs, and it finishes with delivery into the retailer. Despite
this, it is known as a 'smokeless factory' since it doesn't own manufacturing facilities.
Li & Fung ensures there is plenty of capacity by employing suppliers in parallel for the
same components (e.g. yam providers, weavers, assemblers). This has tw o key advan­
tages: it allows reduction of lead times and, should unforeseen manufacturing problems
occur, production can be switched quickly to another supplier.
To drive down costs, Li & Fung shifts activities to countries with low labour costs, low
taxes and favourable regulations, leading to a globally dispersed supply chain, as shown in
Figure 7.16, for Levi's jeans. In the past this has meant sourcing from emerging economies
to supply the developed world. However, the three-year plan (2011 -2013) declared that,
with the emergence of consumer markets in China, and Asia in general, Li & Fung had to
reverse the direction of flow for the first time in its history. The company needed to source
everywhere, including the developed world, and sell to the developing world.

Figure 7.16

Globally dispersed manufacturing processes for Levi's jeans

Supplier m an ag em en t
Li & Fung typically utilises between 30 and 70 per cent of a supplier's capacity to ensure
that, on the one hand, they are an important customer but, on the other, the supplier
is not entirely dependent on their business. Suppliers enjoy detailed performance feed­
back based on benchmarking across the network, giving them the opportunity to not
only satisfy Li & Fung's stringent requirements but also improve their competitiveness.
In any case, there is a strong incentive for suppliers to improve their performance - Li &
Fung can provide ample and steady business.
Quick response is a key priority to ensure manufacturing can respond to fluctuat­
ing demand w ithout excessive mark-downs or stock-outs. This is achieved by reserving
capacity with suppliers on the basis of blanket orders and providing a detailed order
breakdown (by size, style and colour) near the time of manufacture - postponed pur­
chasing. In addition, short production runs are expected so production can be altered
in tandem with market trends.

Questions
1 How does Li & Fung enable agile manufacturing?
2 To what extent does Li & Fung develop partnerships with its suppliers and are they
'agile supply partnerships'?
3 Why has the internet not made trading companies like Li & Fung redundant?


7.2.5 Preconditions for successful agile practice
In addition to the above supply capabilities within the supply chain, there is
another set of factors that need to be in place for the agile principles and prac­
tices to pay off or work at all. These are related to cross-functional alignment
and enterprise-level focus on the contribution of logistics management and strat­
egy. If revenue-generating functions (e.g. sales and marketing) in particular do
not adopt at least a base-level understanding of agile principles, all efforts w ith­
in logistics may be wasted. And if there is not an enterprise-wide focus on the
potential value of logistics, agile efforts are not going to be recognised for what
they are worth - and m ight not provide a compelling enough business case for
the possible investment in them to be made. We propose an enterprise-level reality
check and a cost o f complexity sanity check before investing in agile capabilities. We
also argue that service measures must put the customer first.

Enterprise-level reality check

Starting with the enterprise-wide context, most senior managers know that
turning to logistics and the supply chain is a 'good call' when times get tough.
Logistics probably gets m entioned most in earnings reports when cost cutting is
a response offered to poor performance. In spite of its potential to contribute to
cost-saving programmes, the value of logistics should not be seen as a first port
of call when the bottom line needs to be improved. Agility centres on the notion
of winning in the marketplace based upon service and responsiveness. Whilst
such a strategy can be aimed at doing more for less, it may actually - and more
importantly - be doing less to earn more. Top line improvement can flow from
outperforming competitors through responsiveness to customer needs. Delivery
speed and reliability can be such im portant sources of productivity to customers
that we can earn more of their business and/or charge a premium price for the
service, driving increased revenues.
Conversely, if the delivery service does not meet customer expectations, sales
can be lost. Marks & Spencer (M&S), a household retail brand in the UK, was
faced with online shoppers expecting next-day or even same-day delivery of
their orders, but its antiquated technology and delivery systems were not up to
the job, Butler (2013) reports. This is contributing to its seven consecutive quar­
ters of falling sales in general merchandise ranges (clothing and homewares).
Whilst rival retailer H&M boasts it can get designs from the drawing board to
the store in a fortnight, M&S takes longer than that just to get its merchandise
from the ports to the shops. M&S's finance director outlined the scale of the
challenge:
The business we have got has underinvested in infrastructure for upwards of 20 years.
The way the company buys and distributes its clothing... [is] no longer appropriate.

In addition, in a retail supply chain the improved availability, provided by
effective logistics processes, has the potential to increases sales. In short, an
enterprise-level recognition of the contribution of logistics to increases in rev­
enue, as well as improvements in efficiencies, is a precondition for any business
case on agile practices.




Cost o f complexity sanity check

The value potential of logistics can be capitalised on only if other functions com­
ply with another key precondition: lowering the cost of complexity where differ­
entiation has no competitive value. As much as agility principles are based on the
notion that differentiation is good and 'do-able', it does not mean that revenue
groups (e.g. sales and marketing) should be given 'carte blanche' to create pro­
liferating service, product assortments and promotions. There are limits to how
m uch value that variety creates, and the extent to which these demands can be
met without the cost of complexity spiralling out of control, even for the most
agile supply chain. The key point is not to exceed the capability of the supply
chain to deliver the marketing promise.
Three examples illustrate the cost of complexity (see Section 5.1.2):
• Product, packaging and stock-keeping-unit proliferation, leading to ex­
tremes of 80 per cent or more of products not even generating 1 per cent of
revenue.
• Delivery speed is too high, resulting in increased costs for the customer because
products arrive too early. This increases handling, storage and related costs.
• Promotions and special events that cause upswings in demand based on sales
efforts, not on true customer demand. This in turn leads to downswings shortly
thereafter.
Whilst differentiation of logistics service can generate short-term gain, the
question that revenue-enhancing proposals need to answer is 'will it do so profit­
ably?' Adding a product feature, offering special delivery service and timetables,
and engaging in a special promotion m ight help close a deal in the market in the
short term. But such deals can also create added logistics and supply chain costs
that are not compensated for by the added revenue. One executive from a m anu­
facturing company put it well:
W hen w e sh ow ed the finan cial im pact o f certain deals our sales team s had closed,
it m ade them realise there were certain deals w e should have w alked aw ay from.

Even though it may be hard to assess economic gain or pain from product/
service differentiation, reality can be checked by asking questions and pursuing
actions that help to reduce non-value-added costs of complexity, such as:
• Has the organisation conducted an analysis of revenue contribution by SKU?
• Often a large proportion o f SKUs contribute an incredibly sm all proportion o f
the revenue. Remember, some product proliferation produces only short­
term sales gains. Consider using a revenue threshold for m aintaining a
given SKU.
• Does the organisation have a process for reviewing the product portfolio at
least annually?
• One-off SKU reductions do not address the ongoing tendency to proliferate SKUs
over time. There must be a limit to the num ber of product variations that the
market can absorb? Do customers really value, or even recognise, the new
flavour/colour/recipe?


• Are there hard revenue forecasts related to prom otion requests that can be
evaluated?
• Revenue upside potential is used m ost often to justify adding events and SKUs.
Reviewing real sales impact after the event helps force discipline.

• Is the profitability, as well as revenue contributions, reviewed at SKU level?
• Are added warehousing and distribution costs offset against added revenue
potential?

• Do customers really w ant fast delivery, or is reliable delivery m ore im por­
tant, even w hen slower? Do customers really w ant delivery whenever they
ask for it?
• Understanding w hat the customers really value about the delivery service is crucial.
• Are those people ordering shipments aware of the cost of rush orders and are
they asked to organise shipm ent around real and explicit customer requests?
• Ticking the 'ASAP' ('as soon as possible') box on a shipment form m ay become
standard behaviour, irrespective o f customer need.

Heineken, the brewer, offers a powerful example of the fourth (profitability)
point. During a recent Christmas season it introduced a special product for pro­
motion in the market - the magnum bottle. This seasonal promotion and prod­
uct won several marketing prizes, and created a lot of buzz (or fizz, even!) in the
marketplace. It was also a product that suffered from substantial added shipment,
packaging and production costs because different production line set-ups, bottles,
labels and boxes were needed for a very limited demand window. Was it worth
the effort and focus of the responsive capabilities that were needed for a short­
term gain in revenue?
Another powerful illustration of the promotions issue is a tactic that one execu­
tive calls the 'warehouse dust test':
We take our sales people through our w arehouse w h en they com e to us asking for
n ew products and prom otions and show them the dust levels on other prom otional
products and product variations that we stock. We ask them , 'W hich products can
be d iscontinued w h en w e introduce a n ew product?' or, 'Do w e need the n ew prod­
uct to begin with?'

An important approach to driving improvements in customer service that the
customer values is to measure it from the customer perspective.
Develop measures th a t p u t the end-customer first

All companies include customer service in some form in their performance mea­
surement system. However, almost all operationalise this m easurement inter­
nally, leading to responsiveness that is misguided and focused incorrectly, there­
by limiting network integration across the supply chain. In particular, most
companies measure delivery service in one or multiple ways based upon their
internal definition of success. Typically, the measures focus on how reliably and
quickly the company delivered against the timetable it put forward. This misses
the point, as this timetable m ight not be aligned with end-customers' needs
at all. So companies are not tracking responsiveness to these needs. It is much




better to ask customers for their desired delivery window and measure execution
against that customer-defined measure of success. General Electric realised this
when it presented high delivery reliability scores from its own m easurement to
customers and received a negative reaction. Customers said performance was
not as high at all by their measurement, against w hen they needed deliveries to
take place.
GE changed its measurement set towards what it calls 'Span' measurement. Span
stands for the range of delivery around customer-requested due dates. Essentially, the
company now measures, across all deliveries globally, how close it was to the deliv­
ery date the customer requested when ordering. In its plastics business the company
brought Span down from 30 days to just a few days within a matter of months. This
means that every customer can depend upon GE delivering any product, anywhere
in the globe, when they ask for it, with a maximum variation of just a few days.
The experience of GE suggests the value of several actions to improve measure­
m ent for agility:
• Share measurement dashboards with customers.
• Do not measure against your own measures of success; ask the customer what
defines success for them.
• Hold all parts of the supply chain accountable against the customer-defined
measure of success so that there is no escape from market sensitivity.

7.3 Combining lean and agile
As discussed earlier, there is no reason why there should be an 'either-or' ap­
proach to logistics strategy. In any case, lean approaches should be applied wher­
ever possible, as agility always costs more. Lean and agile can be combined in
three m ain ways, as described in Table 7.6.

Product design allows for this so the product remains generic in
the early stages of manufacture, e.g. design for supply chain

Where base level of demand can be confidently predicted from
past experience



Figure 7.17 Combination of lean and agile using a customer order decoupling
point (CODP)

Considering the three approaches, the Pareto analysis 80:20 strategy proposes
using a lean approach for the SKUs accounting for, say, 80 per cent of sales and
an agile approach for the rem aining long tail of SKUs accounting for, say, only
20 per cent of sales. This effectively segments on the basis of dem and volume
only, but some SKUs, subject to high volume demand, may also be subject to
high dem and variability, as shown by the Kimberly-Clark Case study 2.5 in
Chapter 2.
In the second approach, where a decoupling p oint is located w hen the
product is still in a generic form, lean can be used up to the decoupling point
and agile beyond it, as shown in Figure 7.17. Form postponem ent, explained
in Section 7.2.3, results in this configuration. The th ird approach is where
the predictable stable dem and for an SKU is satisfied w ith a lean approach
and the unpredictable variable dem and for the same SKU is fulfilled w ith an
agile approach.
All three of these approaches to combining lean and agile are relevant,
but the application of lean and agile strategies should be driven by w hat the
market needs. The approach to segmented supply chain strategy explained in,
Section 2.5, describes how supply chain strategy drivers (demand, competitive
and product) can be used to determine the appropriate supply chain strategy,
which may employ lean and agile approaches. Accordingly, the driver matrix
in Figure 7.18 provides an example of how specific elements of the com peti­
tive profile (lead time and delivery frequency) and dem and profile (demand
variability) can be used to segment the SKUs and determine the appropriate
segmented strategies.
Supply chain strategies 1 and 3 in the diagram are lean approaches where de­
m and is stable, whereas strategy 4 is agile where not only is demand volatile but
also a short lead time is required. The four supply chain strategies are described
in more detail below:
• Plan and execute (quadrant 1): this is the least dem anding situation where
dem and is stable and the lead tim e is long. This allows a plan and ex­
ecute approach where econom ic batch quantities are used for production
and waste is m inim ised through the m ost efficient m ethods of produ­
ction and delivery by reducing waste in the system. This strategy can
be prone to excessive inventories of finished product outbound. High
volume, low variety auto products typically are produced by means of this
strategy.

(Source: After Christopher, 2011, p. 101)

• Make to order (quadrant 2): w hen dem and variability is high (volatile), yet
the order lead tim e is long and delivery frequency low, there is the oppor­
tunity to make to order. This reduces the risk associated w ith speculative
m anufacture based on forecasts, w hich are highly inaccurate w hen dem and
is volatile.
• Continuous replenishment or kanban JIT replenishment (lean) (quadrant 3): if
we take the situation where dem and is stable but lead times are short and
deliveries frequent, then some type of continuous replenishm ent system is
appropriate where deliveries are m ade on a regular and frequent basis, say
daily, or a kanban pull system is operated. Both these approaches are part
of a lean approach and depend on stable dem and. Fast-moving consumer
products are examples where continuous replenishm ent strategies are most
often used.
• Form postponem ent or react and execute (agile) (quadrant 4): in the most chal­
lenging situation where dem and is volatile and lead tim e is short, a react
and execute approach is required, akin to an agile approach. This strate­
gy prioritises investm ent in reducing lead time, and building up process­
es th at can respond quickly to volatile dem and. If, despite investm ent in
lead-time reduction, the order lead tim e is still too short to allow full m anu­
facture, the m anufacture of the generic product can be conducted speculatively and the final m anufacture or assembly can be postponed, as in form
postponem ent.
The vision of creating an agile supply chain is a valuable starting point but until
recently it was mostly just vision. The experiences and cases presented in this sec­
tion show how the vision can be supplemented and how the im plementation of
agility can be approached practically.


Summary
What is lean thinking, and how does it apply to logistics?

• Lean thinking is a philosophy that has been derived from JIT principles. It
seeks perfection by gradually reducing waste from each of four areas: specifying
value from the end-customer perspective; identifying the value stream through
time-based mapping; making the product flow through the supply network by
applying JIT principles; and letting the customer pull through application of
pull scheduling.
• Longstanding approaches to material control, such as re-order point stock
control, economic order and economic batch quantities (EOQ and EBQ) and
material requirements planning (MRP), can be made to be far more respon­
sive by application of lean principles. Examples include reduction of batch
sizes, re-order quantities and lead times. All of these help to reduce logistics
P-times.
What is agility, and how does it compare to lean?

• Agility is a supply-chain-wide capability that aligns organisational structures,
information systems, logistics processes and, in particular, mindsets. It means
using market knowledge and a responsive supply chain to exploit profitable
opportunities in a volatile marketplace. Agile supply is concerned with devel­
oping capabilities proactively to position a supply chain to benefit from mar­
ketplaces in which product lifecycles are shrinking, product variety is increas­
ing, and the ability to forecast demand is reducing.
• Lean thinking is concerned primarily with the elimination of waste. The order
winners that are supported by this mindset are cost and quality. Agility is con­
cerned primarily with supporting order winners of speed and flexible response.
Time compression is a fundamental requirement for leanness, but only one of
the enablers of agility.
• A key difference in supply strategy is that lean thinking is concerned with
placing orders upstream for products that move in a regular flow. Agile strategy is
concerned with assigning capacity so that products can be made rapidly to meet
demand that is difficult to forecast.
What are the agile practices that help to underpin the agile supply chain?

• The im portant capabilities required for an agile supply chain are being market
sensitive and network-based, and also having process integration and virtual
integration, and these are necessary to meet both predictable and unpredict­
able demand variability. Practices to enable agility are m any and span plan­
ning, product design, manufacturing and supply partnerships.
• Sales and operations planning (S&OP) is an integrated business m anagem ent
process developed in the 1980s by Oliver Wight, which encourages mediumterm forecasting from both a dem and and supply perspective. Ultimately




it enables supply to be aligned with dem and and is particularly im portant
where dem and is variable and unpredictable, therefore requiring an agile
response.
• Agile supply chains are a response to shortening product life cycles, typical of
fashion products, and proliferating product variants. Crucial to achieving market
sensitivity necessary for agility is the capability to develop products quickly and
efficiently. Equally, once in production, the associated costs and speed are just as
important. Both these goals can be achieved through product development being
coordinated with supply chain design (manufacturing, sourcing and logistics).
• Agility requires responsive and flexible manufacturing, which can be adapted
quickly to new products and accommodate changes in mix (range of variants)
and volume of production with minimum cost or time penalties. One important
approach is form postponement, which involves the delay of the differentiation
manufacturing process until receipt of a customer order, thereby allowing a high
variety product to be supplied on a short lead time with minimum inventory
support.
• Relationships could be described as the critical success factor of m any agile
supply chains, which are dependent on a network of supply chain partners
that collaborate to meet the end-customer needs by making available their
resources to each other. However, whilst agile supply chain relationships can
be described as highly involved strategic partnerships, they are frequently re­
configured, which suggests a short-term relationship. Agile partnerships are
proposed but these cannot be used exclusively across the supply base; stable
partnerships are still required.
• Preconditions for successful agile practice include an 'enterprise-level reality
check' - senior managers need to appreciate that logistics contributes to com­
petitive advantage not just costs. A 'cost of complexity sanity check' is also a
precondition to ensure, for instance, product variants are adding value and not
just cost. Finally, developing measures that put the end-customer first and are
developed from their perspective, are essential to an agile supply chain.
• Lean and agile approaches can be combined in different ways to meet the
changing market needs. Building on the ideas of segmented supply chain
strategy, presented in Chapter 2, it is im portant that lean and agile strategies
are combined in order to meet changing market needs, as defined by strategy
drivers - demand, competitive and product.

Discussion questions
1 Suggest order winning and order qualifying criteria for the following product
environments:
a reprocessing nuclear fuel;
b upstream petroleum refining;
c downstream manufacture of petroleum products;
d high-value automotive products, such as Range Rover or BMW 5 series.


To what extent would lean and agile mindsets contribute to the support of such prod­
ucts in the marketplace?
2 Dealers have criticised the way auto assemblers use JIT as an excuse for buying parts
from the inbound supply network 'so that their costs are kept down'. They then
dump finished vehicles onto the dealer by matching 'their perceptions of a market­
place demand with their constraints as a manufacturer, i.e. what they've produced'
(adapted from Delbridge and Oliver, 1991). Referring to the Ford/Toyota case study
in Section 6.2.2, comment on the trade-offs implied in these comments from dis­
gruntled dealers.
3 What matters more: value to the customer or value to the shareholder? Refer to Sec­
tion 3.7 of Chapter 3 in formulating your response. How does this question impact
on the philosophy of lean thinking?
4 What is meant by the term overproduction ? Why do you think this has been described
as the biggest waste of all?
5 Explain the difference between surge and base demands. M ulti Electronique SA
(ME) produces a range of electrical connectors fo r the automotive industry. Cur­
rently, the six production lines at its factory in Toulouse are fully loaded, operating
a three-shift system for five days per week. One of ME's major customers wants to
place an order that would add loading equivalent to a seventh production line,
but only fo r the summer months (May to September). Sales are keen to accept
the new order, but it would need to be taken at prices that are no higher than for
current business. Suggest options for how ME m ight manage this order if they ac­
cepted it.
6 Refer back to Figure 2.1 in Chapter 2: it shows a Pareto curve for the sales per SKU
of a book stockist. A small number of 'h o t sellers' constitute most of the sales, whilst
there is a lengthy tail of slow-selling lines and new introductions. The operations
people are pressing for the 'tail' to be chopped in half, arguing that it adds cost,
not value, to the business. They argue that each order is taken at fixed cost, regard­
less of size. Sales order processing and pick and dispatch from the warehouse are
examples of such fixed costs. 'Instead, we should focus on the core of the business:
90 per cent of our business comes from just 10 per cent of the titles,' the operations
director argues. 'We could chop our costs in half and lose only 5 -7 per cent of the
business. Think of the effect on margin!' Sales, on the other hand, are reluctant to
give up any of the titles, arguing that it is customer choice that drives the business.
'We have built up this business on the strength of our product range,' the sales
director argues. 'Retailers come to us because we are a one-stop shop. If we haven't
got it in stock, we get it.' Explain the above in terms of a lean versus agile de­
bate, using the concepts of market winners and qualifiers and benefiting from small
volumes.

Part T h r e e
WORKING TOGETHER
In a supply network, no firm is an island that stands on its own. N or does it compete
on its own. A focal firm depends on its netw ork partners fo r com ponents to assemble,
fo r products to sell, for the m ovem ent of goods, and so on. W hilst Part Two focused
on the central logistics task of achieving responsiveness to custom er demand, most
firms cannot achieve this w ith o u t the support of their netw ork partners. Complete
vertical integration of an industry is unusual today - although 'vertical retailers', such
as Zara, have developed a similar strategy. Functional specialisation of suppliers on
those parts of the value proposition in which they excel, coupled w ith integration into
the supply network, is more com m on.
This is becoming especially relevant today. Some m anufacturing firms, fo r example
in the electronics and autom otive industries, add only 10-20 per cent of total added
value internally. The rest is created in the supply base - by com m odity suppliers, by
co-designers and co-manufacturers, by main suppliers and by their supply partners.
Chapter 8 offers approaches to integration and collaboration in the supply chain, and
Chapter 9 offers insights into sourcing and supply management.






CHAPTER 8

Integrating the supply chain

Objectives

The intended objectives of this chapter are to:
•

explain the need to coordinate processes both within a company and
between companies;

•

introduce a range of options for buyer-supplier relationships;

•

understand how the appropriate buyer-supplier relationship can be
selected;

•

describe the implications of establishing strategic partnerships.

By the end of this chapter, you should be able to understand:
•

the benefits of collaboration within supply chains;

•

the range of alternative inter-company relationships;

•

the benefits and challenges of operating strategic partnerships;

•

ways of approaching strategic partnership implementation.

Introduction
A number of alternative supply chain structures have emerged, based upon net­
works and the degree of inter-firm collaboration. A well-known view is that of
Sako (1992), who distinguishes a 'spectrum' of possible supply relationships,
ranging from:
• arm's length: a detailed contract specifies the responsibilities of both parties
including terms and conditions. Undue familiarity is avoided, and neither
party is controlled by the other. Divorce is a readily available option when the
contract finishes;
• obligational: individual contracts are still in evidence but embedded within a
broader relationship of mutual trust. Outline specifications are more common,
but there is 'an incentive to do more than is expected'.
Optimising the supply chain process inevitably leads to a growing inter­
dependence amongst supply chain partners, and obligational behaviour becomes
more in evidence. With this interdependence, a realisation develops that increasing
levels of adaptation are necessary to achieve long-term mutual benefit. Adaptation




means making changes to a firm's internal processes in order to accommodate the
needs of supply partners. Supply partners may have to develop a common set of
control mechanisms. Hunter et al. (1996) comment:
The tw o organisations w ill still be subject to in d epend en t governance, but w ill have
in com m on a sim ilar set o f governance procedures and m echanism s specific to their
joint w orking relationship, thus replicating in som e m easure the con d itions w ith in
an integrated organisation.

Such common governance is more in keeping with the obligational view.
The implications for competitive strategy of this growth of collaborative supply
chains are considerable - in particular the need to develop those skills that enable
a company to re-engineer established buyer-supplier relationships and success­
fully to manage them on a day-to-day basis.
But a one-sided view of the relationship may be the norm elsewhere, and have
quite different implications for the firms involved. For example, Rubery et al.
(2004) studied the way that a customer firm may 'extend its tentacles inside the
[supplier firm] to re-shape the internal hum an resource practices'. The customer
firm may exert pressure on a supplier's hum an resource (HR) practices in areas
such as hours worked (to fit with their own), performance assessment and associ­
ated bonus payments.
Centralised purchasing decisions also may impact greatly on supplier relation­
ships. Whilst operations and logistics are developing supplier relationship manage­
ment, purchasing may replace existing suppliers with new ones with whom there is
no current relationship. And whilst centralisation lowered purchasing costs overall,
manufacturing and logistics costs were increased (Pagell, 2004). Purchasing may be
measured on the visible reductions in piece part prices, but the invisible costs of lon­
ger transport times, extra inventories and poor delivery reliability go unchallenged.
The overall aim of this chapter is to explore the need for integrating supply
chain processes, and then to review different types of supply relationship, the
impact on the firms involved, and the situations where a given type of relation­
ship is most relevant to a supply chain's competitive position.

Key issues

This chapter addresses six key issues:
1 Integration in the supply chain: the benefits of internal and external coordination
and how it m ig h t be achieved.
2 Choosing the right supply relationships: w hich relationship is appropriate in d if­
ferent circumstances.
3 Strategic partnerships in the supply chain: cooperative, coordinated and collab­
orative relationships; th eir advantages and disadvantages.
4 Implementing strategic partnerships: Approaches to im plem enting partnerships
and potential pitfalls in m oving from open market negotiations to collaborative
relationships.
5 M anaging supply chain relationships: the objective of deeper, closer relation­
ships in the supply chain and factors fo r achieving them .
6 Supplier networks: the developm ent of supplier associations and the Japanese
equivalent, keiretsu.


8.1 Integration in the supply chain
Key issue: How can we integrate internally, externally and electronically?

W hat drives integration in the supply chain? Procter & Gamble's desire is to
design the supply chain to meet the needs of end-customers, starting from point
of sale and working backwards to deliver the right product, in the right place, at
the right time, of the right quality. The following are four principles of Procter &
Gamble's supply chain strategy:
• Produce every product that needs to be produced every day through short
cycle production.
• Communicate with suppliers in real time - suppliers with whom we have built
long-term relationships and with whom we have integrated systems.
• Draw demand data from the point nearest to the end-customer - in this case,
the retail cash register.
• Collaboration between all supply chain partners using a multifunctional ap­
proach (commercial and supply chain working together) and aligned metrics
focusing on delivering to the end-customer.
All of these principles involve integration - both internal and external. 'Inte­
gration' in the context of the supply chain is concerned with coordination : estab­
lishing the ‘rules of the road' whereby material and information flows work in
practice.
Evidence that improved integration (both upstream and downstream) leads to
improved performance for the supply chain as a whole has been found by survey
research for firms in fabricated metal products, machinery and equipment m anu­
facturing (Frohlich and Westbrook, 2001). Integration was measured across eight
variables, as follows:
1 Access to planning systems.
2 Sharing production plans.
3 Joint EDI access/networks.
4 Knowledge of inventory mix/levels.
5 Packaging customisation.
6 Delivery frequencies.
7 Common logistical equipment/containers.
8 Common use of third party logistics.
The authors coined the term 'arcs of integration' (our version of which is shown
in Figure 8.1) which indicates both:
• the direction o f integration: upstream with suppliers and/or downstream with
customers; and
• the degree o f integration: the extent to which the integration practices are evi­
dent across either the supplier or customer base.





Figure 8.1

Arcs of integration

(Source: After Frohlich and Westbrook, 2001)

This landmark study indicated that business performance was positively pro­
portional to 'the breadth' of the arc and the 'balance' of the arc. In other words,
high levels of integration with, say, customers does not lead to high levels of busi­
ness performance if integration with suppliers is neglected. The arc of integration
supports the view that, for integration to deliver business benefits, it is required
to span the end-to-end supply chain.
We can also propose that broader integration reduces uncertainty of material
flow through the supply network. In turn, this improves efficiency and reduces
the P-time (Chapter 5).

8.1.1

Internal integration: function to function
Another survey - this time of over 300 organisations in the USA - probed inte­
gration between marketing and logistics functions within a focal firm (Stank
et al., 1999). As we discussed in Section 7.2.1, sales and operations planning (S&OP)
can improve integration between these functions. Consistent with this idea,
Stank et al., (1999) found that more frequent integrative behaviour between mar­
keting and logistics resulted in better performance and better interdepartmental
effectiveness. This may seem obvious, but the improvements in performance in­
cluded cycle time reduction, better in-stock performance, increased product avail­
ability levels and improvements in order-to-delivery lead times. This is, no doubt,
due to the successful resolution of conflicting objectives, which were discussed in
Section 2.5.1, where similar enablers to alignment between marketing and supply
chain management are considered.
Stank et al. (1999) found that firms with higher internal integration dem on­
strated higher relative logistics performance compared with less integrated firms.


There was no difference between 'high' and 'low' integration firms on basic
service; that is, consistent delivery on request data and advance notification of
delays and shortages. However, on the 'higher value' service elements, such as
delivery reliability, there was a significant difference. High-integration firms had
higher performance in terms of meeting customer needs, accommodating spe­
cial customer requests and new product introductions. This resulted in an en­
hanced customer perception of the organisations. Similar conclusions are arrived
at by Windahl and Lakemond (2006), especially where the firm is developing
integrated products and services such as 'power for life' (see Case study 2.4).
A study of Spanish food manufacturers by Gimenez (2006) shows that the
highest levels of external integration are achieved by firms that have already
achieved the highest levels of internal integration between logistics, production
and marketing. The implications of this research are that firms should continue
to work at improving internal integration. For example, functional barriers be­
tween purchasing, manufacturing and distribution may lead to the following
scenarios:
• Purchasing buys castings on the basis of low price, but the supplier has a poor
record for delivery reliability and quality. Manufacturing is faced with uncer­
tain deliveries and high reject rates.
• Manufacturing aims to keep machine and labour productivity high, so batch
sizes are kept high. Distribution is faced with poor availability, especially of
class B and C parts.
• Distribution wants to m aintain a fast throughput warehousing operation, so
resists carrying out any post-manufacturing operations. Manufacturing is faced
with the additional complexity of customising products.
Internal integration is the key starting point for broader integration across the
supply chain. As Robert Lynch said (cited in Kirby, 2003: 69), 'For some reason al­
liance professionals find it easier to create alliances with their major competitors
than with other divisions in their own companies. We don't deal with our own
internal integration. How can we integrate externally if we can't do it internally?'

Activity 8.1
Taking your business (or one well-known to you) as an example, how well do the internal
functions integrate? Consider the purchasing-manufacturing-distribution example above and
develop a scenario for the company, using the company's names for the functions concerned.
What impact does your scenario have on material flow?

A lignm ent between supply chain m anagem ent an d the rest o f the
business

Key functions that form parts of the supply chain or impact supply chain perfor­
mance need to align around priorities, opportunities and approaches. The fact
that this is often not the case impedes supply chain efforts and m ight be what
stands between 'great plan' and 'great success'.




Figure 8.2 shows a chart from van Hoek and Mitchell (2006) that demonstrates
the challenge of internal alignment. This chart captures findings from an inter­
nal survey of a globally operating manufacturing company (repeated in many
other companies with similar results). The survey included existing supply chain
priorities and initiatives (as shown down the y-axis). The supply chain team and
peers in other functions - in particular, sales - were surveyed. They were asked
for their opinion about the relative importance of these priorities and the current
performance on them. The difference between importance and performance is
considered to be an indication of the opportunity for improvement.
Figure 8.2 shows how opportunity scores of respondents from sales contrasts
with those from supply chain. W hen bars point to the right, sales sees a greater

priority; when bars point to the left, the supply chain sees a greater priority. Taken
together, the chart tells a shocking story of misalignment. Not least, when looking
at the smallest bar in the centre of the graph, it appears that there is one and only
one area where supply chain and sales more or less agree - the area of internal
alignment. An interpretation of this is that the only thing we agree upon is that
we do not agree on anything, and that we need to align better. Another obvious
area of misalignment is that sales is asking for improved transportation m an­
agement and delivery services. But sales is asking for less focus on the enablers


of improved delivery service, such as forecasting accuracy. The chart reveals the
painful challenge many supply chain managers face on a day-to-day basis: com­
plaints about shipments but little support for its improvement efforts that are
critically dependent on support from other functions.
CASE STUDY

8.1

Internal Alignment at Alfa Laval
When the senior supply chain executive team from Alfa Laval conducted an alignment
analysis throughout the company, as exemplified in Figure 8.2, it realised there were a
lot of basics to be improved. The team identified four areas where alignment improve­
ment efforts could be focused: in interactions with peers from other functions; in inter­
actions w ith their bosses and the board; in interactions with their teams; and in their
own day-to-day behaviour. Some of the mechanisms and actions defined by the team
are captured in Figure 8.3, which they termed their 'alignment compass'.
k Bosses

Peers
• Support exchange programmes and
job rotations across functions
• Invest in understanding each other's
problems and building relationships;
capture the voice of other functions
and be able to articulate plans in their
language, no t our jargon
• Develop appropriate KPIs across
functions; ensure tha t KPIs are linked
or at least coordinated and not driving
conflicting behaviour
• Joint problem solving teams to tackle
com m on issues

• Join sales on key customer visits to ensure you are
close enough to the customer in driving the supply
chain agenda and focusing efforts and service + be
credible w ith sales when discussing service
• Align goals between functions and link those to
incentives
• Encourage the use of the same language, avoiding
functional jargon and prom oting the use of business
language (profit, customers, service, etc.)
• Support appropriate forecasting tools
• Ensure tha t operations/supply chain is seen to take
action on old issues and com municates results to
other functions (d o n 't forget to tell others w hat has
been done, there is no way tha t others know when
you d o n 't tell them )

• Improve the initiative planning process to focus on

price, etc.) and articulate initiatives in those terms

Figure 8.3

Alfa Laval's alignment compass

In this effort, tw o key areas received a lot of attention - improving communication and
training in supply chain and operations, and improving the initiative planning process.




Starting with the latter, it was surprising for the executive team to see that there was no
appreciation from peers in other functions for some of the strategic initiatives under way
in the supply chain. The team realised that this was going to make the journey through
those efforts harder at least and impossible at worst. It was decided that improvements
could be made in the initiative planning process by expanding pilots in cross-functional
efforts in the supply chain already under way and that the planning process could be
improved to capture the voice of the organisation upfront. Areas earmarked as valuable
included initial discussions with key peers to ensure engagement, time and resource
commitment, and the effective focusing of initiatives.
In the communication area it was realised that the case for supply chain initiatives was
not clearly communicated to begin with, and that peers were not committed to the imple­
mentation journey. Specific communication tactics for improving this situation included:
•
•
•
•

using training in other functions as a channel for communication;
moving away from jargon and technical language;
moving towards using shared business language that puts initiatives in terms of
shared output objectives and in terms of benefits to priorities in other functions;
communicating the case for initiatives from the start, and frequently updating peers
on progress and, more importantly, results against shared output objectives.

It is important to note that these communication improvements are also intended
to be personal in nature and should not be left to an internal communications depart­
ment. They need to be incorporated into the personal toolkit of supply chain managers
in order to increase the likelihood of initiative success, effective cross-functional man­
agement and, most importantly, their personal effectiveness. It was found that driving
success in these areas will require some training, coaching and possible 'tag teaming'
with peers - or even job rotation.

Questions
1 Can you provide examples of how functional agendas m ight clash, leading to chal­
lenges in supply chain initiatives?
2 Can you suggest additional integrative mechanisms along the axes of the alignment
compass?

The Alfa Laval case demonstrates that effective communication between supply
chain and other functions is a key challenge in ensuring cross-functional align­
m ent around im portant business goals. Travis Perkins plc developed a simple, but
effective, approach to this, as illustrated by the next case.
CASE STUDY

8.2

The 'language of profit' at Travis Perkins plc
Travis Perkins plc (TP) is the largest UK merchant supplier of building material to self­
builders and the construction industry. It has doubled in size in recent years, in part
through acquisitions, and now owns 17 businesses, including Wickes and Toolstation,
which altogether encompass approximately 2,000 sales branches. The supply chain is
highly decentralised, using multiple warehouses and around 3,000 delivery vehicles to


supply in the region of 250,000 SKUs. Not surprisingly, given the bulky nature of many
of the products (e.g. timber, gravel and bricks), about 80 per cent by volume of prod­
ucts are delivered direct to the customers from TP's suppliers.
Following the economic crisis of 2008, the UK economy experienced a dramatic
drop in activity in the construction industry and demand for many of TP's products
dropped circa 30 per cent, with suppliers reducing delivery frequencies to save costs.
These events led to a reduction in product availability and excessive stock. There was
a need to motivate the branch teams, the senior management team and suppliers to
support the supply chain management (SCM) team in their endeavours to improve the
situation. However, the SCM team was small in comparison to the operations team,
who were focused on cost reduction. So how could they align the business to invest in
improving availability?
TP had found that SCM language was a barrier to improvements:
Unfortunately your SKU did not arrive within lead time due to a problem
with the safety stock calculation, following our recent collaborative partner­
ship move to lean production postponement.
Frequently, neither branch operations nor senior managers understood SCM, so they
devised the 'language of profit' - a common language that all functions can under­
stand, especially operators and senior management. Importantly, it allows priorities to
be defined in terms of lost revenue and increased costs in order to initiate actions in the
business. Two examples of 'language of profit' in use are:
•

Product availability example. Stock-outs were losing TP sales and damaging its reputa­
tion. Communicating availability percentages, e.g. simply saying 'We have 95 per
cent availability', did not motivate branch teams to rectify the situation. Using the
language of profit, TP calculated:

Lost sales = stock-out days x average demand x sales price
The SCM team was then able to identify the top 30 SKUs by lost sales, which
motivated branch teams and provided a meaningful way of prioritising remedial
actions. They also totalled the impact for suppliers and text messaged the sup­
plier MDs with the 'opportunity' to drive actions.
•

Transport efficiency example. Using global positioning systems (CPS), TP was able
to track its many delivery vehicles and it was known that trucks could be standing
stationary with engines running (referred to as 'idling tim e') for long periods of
time, needlessly consuming valuable fuel. However, it wasn't clear just how big the
problem, or rather opportunity, was until SCM translated idling time into costs of
approximately £900,000. Branches were then league tabled for MDs to take action.

Both these examples demonstrate how the language of profit can be used to great
effect in supply chains to drive actions both inside and outside the organisation, thus
influencing a much larger sales team and the senior managers.

Alignm ent between supply chain m anagem ent an d new
product development

In addition to improving internal alignment with sales, new product
development is a key peer function that deserves internal alignment focus. In
Section 7.2.2 we considered product design for agility from the product designer's
perspective. However, it is pointed out often that the impact of the supply chain
on new product development (NPD) and new product introduction is im portant
in areas such as:
• shipping products to market fast enough (before product launch dates);
• ensuring sufficient inventory at the launch date; and
• ensuring a flow of parts and components for new product manufacturing.
Examples of how this presents itself in practice are provided by Nike and Reckitt Benckiser (van Hoek and Chapman, 2006). At Nike (see Case study 4.3) - as
in most fashion companies - it is im portant to ensure that all key accounts
have sufficient stock available at the start of each of the four seasons in a year
when a rush for products begins. That means ensuring supply of several th o u ­
sand SKUs from multiple suppliers globally, through the distribution channel
to all customers on time simultaneously. Missing the launch date disappoints
customers and affects overall product revenue. Equally, w hen a new blockbuster
video game is introduced in the market, one-third or more of the entire sales
take place within the first 24 hours of the product becoming available, with
people lining up in front of stores before a m idnight release. Obviously, in this
example, it is also crucial to ensure sufficient supply to stores in order to avoid
lost sales, and disappointed customers and accounts. In conclusion, new prod­
uct development and the supply chain is another key area where internal align­
m ent must be targeted.
Like many companies, Reckitt Benckiser, a consumer products company, found
forecasts for new products to be one area where misalignment between supply
chain and NPD was particularly costly and challenging. A major challenge with
new products is that there is less historical reference data to use as a base num ber
for forecasting and there are more uncertainties to contend with around such
im portant issues as an exact launch date, and supply volumes. Misalignment was
found to be costly because poor forecasts led to limited product availability, disap­
pointed customers and lots of firefighting and last-minute fixes. Several reasons
were found for the underperformance of the forecasting process. These included
tendencies to average out forecasts when functions do not agree, delayed response
due to lack of group consensus, and even forecasts that become available late as a
result of forecasting being given a low priority for too long.
In order to address these shortcomings and contribute to supply chain readi­
ness, Reckitt Benckiser created a new role in the supply chain team - a new prod­
uct introduction forecasting manager. This manager is dedicated to working with
functions involved in the NPD process specifically to drive alignment around
the forecast. The manager flags forecasting differences between functions, spots
possible challenges in assumptions and works across functions to arrive at a more
accurate forecast. Next, the forecasting manager supports the translation of the


forecast into a supply chain capacity plan, and forms a natural spotlight in the
organisation for avoiding bottlenecks.
With supply chain readiness for NPD improved and with fewer execution
issues and less firefighting, the supply chain team has manoeuvred itself into
a better position. It is less likely to be distracted by last-minute crises and more
likely to be considered a useful member of the NPD team that can make valuable
contributions based upon the capability it has to offer.

Activity 8.2
Assume for a moment that you are a supply chain manager invited into a new product develop­
ment team meeting. What questions would you ask of the team to ensure you can prepare your
supply chain for effective product launch?

8.1.2 Inter-company integration
If significant improvements can be achieved by internal integration, potential
for the benefits of external integration could be even higher. One of the keys to
increased responsiveness in the supply chain is a high level of integration with
upstream suppliers. Analysis of the supply chain often shows that production
lead time is measured usually in weeks rather than days. This is caused by exces­
sive inventories of raw materials, packaging materials and intermediate products
being held upstream of the final point of manufacture. Not only does this rep­
resent a cost burden, it also increases the P-time of the supply chain as a whole.
Two m ain approaches are observable as leading-edge companies seek to inte­
grate upstream supply chain:
• inte g ra te d processes;

• synchronous production.
Integrated processes

A key focus of supplier integration should be the alignment of critical processes:
that is, new product development, material replenishment and payment. This
alignment needs to consider collaborative planning and strategy development. It
is perhaps the concept of joint strategy development that distinguishes integrated
supply chains from mere 'marriages of convenience'. Whilst the customer will
always be pre-eminent in the determination of joint strategic goals, involvement
of key suppliers in this process benefits all parties.
Supplier partnerships, as discussed in Sections 8.3 and 8.4, lead to the highest
levels of process integration between companies. Also, process integration can
be enhanced through the creation of supplier development teams. The purpose of
these teams is to work with suppliers to explore ways in which process align­
m ent can be achieved; for example, seeking to establish a common 'information
highway' between the vendor and the customer, or working to establish common




product identification codes. Nissan in the UK reports that supplier development
teams have been a significant element in its success in creating a more responsive
supply chain.
Synchronous production

Linking upstream production schedules with downstream demand helps to
improve material flow. The creation of a 'seamless' network of processes aims
to dramatically reduce inventories whilst greatly enhancing responsiveness.
The Japanese concept of heijunka seeks coordination of material movements
between different processes in the supply network. Heijunka is referred to often as
'levelled scheduling', which involves distributing volume and mix evenly over
a given time period. Output of each major process in the supply chain therefore
matches end-customer demand as closely as possible throughout that time period
(Harrison, 2005).
In today's world of increasingly volatile demand patterns, level schedules may
not be possible to achieve, at least not for all products at all times. In this case
transparency of information upstream and downstream is essential for synchro­
nisation to work. For example, the supplier must be able to access the customer's
forward production schedules, and the customer must be able to see into the sup­
plier's 'stockroom'. The virtual supply chain envisages partners in the chain being
linked together by a common information system, so that information replaces the
need for inventories. Equally, Bose's supplier-in-plant approach in Case study 8.3
also achieves improved transparency and more synchronised flow.

CASE S T U D Y

8.3

Bose Corporation put 'supplier in plant'
The Bose Corporation, a USA-based manufacturer of hi-fi equipment (as shown in
Figure 8.4) developed the JIT2 concept in the early 1990s. Bose recognised that, if
the traditional buyer-supplier relationships were to be made more effective, more peo­
ple would be required in its organisation. However, budget constraints meant that no
additional people could be employed in this role. This acted as a driver to develop the
JIT2 concept.
A logical extension of the just-in-time concept, described in Chapter 6, is to place
customer and supplier processes closer together. The JIT2 approach goes a stage further
by eliminating the buyer and the salesman from the customer-supplier relationship,
thus fostering increased communication between the parties. The principle is simple: a
supplier employee who resides full time in the customer's purchasing office replaces the
buyer and supplier. This supplier-in-plant is empowered to use the customer's scheduling
system to place orders with their own company. In addition, the supplier-in-plant does
the material planning for the materials supplied by his company.
The 'supplier in-plant' is also part of the production planning process, so production is
planned concurrently with the supplier organisation. This form of integration streamlines
the supply process by removing the multi-level planner-buyer-salesman-supplier
plant process by making this the responsibility of one individual. This dramatically
reduces the demand uncertainty experienced by the supplier organisations. The benefits



Figure 8.4

Bose's speaker system

of this streamlining have also resulted in major business improvements for Bose. These
include:
•
•
•
•

50 per cent improvement in terms of on-time deliveries, damage and shortages;
6 per cent reduction in material costs;
26 per cent improvement in equipment utilisation;
major reductions in inventory holdings.

The Bose supplier-in-plant concept demonstrates how collaboration and integration
can benefit the supply chain. The supplier-in-plant can, to a large degree, be super­
seded by today's electronic integration techniques.

Questions
1 What are the opportunities for the JIT2 supplier-in-plant principle in your chosen
company?
2 Could the principle help to improve integration, either by a company representative
working in the customer's organisation, or by representatives from major suppliers
working in your chosen company?

There are a number of approaches that seek to synchronise supply chain pro­
cesses between companies in the supply chain, as detailed in Section 6.2. For
instance, collaborative planning, forecasting and replenishment (CPFR), quick
response (specifically used in apparel retail supply chains) and vendor managed
inventory (VMI). For VMI, the supplier takes responsibility for planning and
controlling inventory for the customer. The advantage is that a large element of
uncertainty in the supply chain is removed through shared information. The
need for safety stock can thereby be dramatically reduced.




8.1.3

Electronic integration
Much of the pioneering work for electronic integration has been in the fastmoving consumer goods (FMCG) sector between retailers and manufacturers.
The traditional way to exchange orders and delivery inform ation has been by
means of electronic data interchange (EDI), as discussed in Section 6.3.1, and
is particularly prevalent in the grocery sector. However, EDI systems can be
incompatible with each other, and have high development and installation
costs. Technologies based on the internet offer worldwide connectivity and
relative ease of access.
Achieving visibility throughout the supply chain is of param ount importance
in the search for competitive advantage. The exponential development of internet
technology, together with the increased power of the personal computer, has
transformed business-to-consumer (B2C) relationships, as discussed in Section
2.1.2. Equally it offers organisations a relatively cheap means of integrating
information systems across the supply chain in business-to-business (B2B)
relationships.
The internet provides a platform-independent communications highway that
can be used as a cross-company interface to enable electronic commerce. Thereby,
it fosters operationally efficient, connected and cooperative relationships amongst
manufacturers, suppliers and distributors. Using the internet can provide an easy
and cost-effective answer that is available to all partners in a network.
E-business is a term used to cover trading with a firm's suppliers and business
customers - that is, business to business - by electronic means. A feature of B2B is
the formation of online trading communities (see, for example, Ariba, www.ariba
.net) and electronic marketplaces. Such structures have been enabled by the ex­
plosion of internet technology and seek to offer cost reductions in procurement
of both direct and indirect goods, and also in the processing of such transactions.
The relationship of these terms in the context of the 'e-supply chain' is shown in
Figure 8.5.

Figure 8.5

e-business terminology


Trading partners can integrate electronically in three ways: transactional, infor­
m ation sharing and collaborative planning.
Transactional: the electronic execution o f transactions

This is found usually in business-to-business (B2B) e-commerce, with the trad­
ing partners focusing on the autom ation of business transactions such as pur­
chase orders, invoices, order and advanced shipment notices, load tendering and
acknowledgements, and freight invoices and payments. These transactions in­
volve the electronic transmission of a fixed-format document with predefined
data and information fields.
Inform ation sharing: the electronic sharing or exchange o f inform ation

Trading partners are given access to a system with shared information. Often,
however, one partner transmits shared information to another. The information
is sent on a 'for your information' basis; the recipient uses the data as it stands,
and no feedback is given. Shared information may include product descriptions
and pricing, promotional calendars, inventory levels, shipment tracking and trac­
ing. This type of arrangement supports only independent planning by each part­
ner. Uncertainty is reduced by each partner becoming aware of other partners'
activities. However, trading partners do not have the opportunity to comm ent on
or change the plan in any way.
We develop the concept of information sharing by means of a case study in
continuous replenishment (CR). Continuous replenishment logistics is a pioneering
approach to using developments in IT to supply demand quickly from the m anu­
facturer. Using electronic point of sale (EPOS) data to track customer demand
through the till, CR shares data from retailer to supplier. The aim is for the sup­
plier to replace quickly what has been sold today, so that stock availability on the
shelf is maintained at the retailer. Case study 8.4 gives a view of where fashion
logistics is heading.
CASE STUDY

8.4

Continuous replenishment in the apparel industry
Global 'vertical' supply strategies in the apparel industry aim to emulate retailers such as
Zara, which sources everything from set manufacturing plants that are situated close to
its retail outlets. Setting up a similar operation in the US would be problematic - for a
start, there is not much left of the apparel manufacturing base because it went overseas
long ago for cost reasons. Competitive pressures are constantly increasing - a significant
percentage of the industry is fashion-driven - and fashion changes continuously. Thus,
time-to-market is increasingly important. Kumar and Arbi (2008) note:
Turnaround time is important for US fashion retailers intending to compete
with Europe's low-cost fashion providers, including H&M and Zara. Both Euro­
pean stores have created production models that deliver inexpensive fashion
apparel in weeks, rather than months. Zara designs, produces and delivers
a garment in 15 days to US stores according to a 2005 profile by Harvard




Business School's Working Knowledge. For American apparel chains, Central
America is a potential outsourcing destination, with lower production costs
than the USA, falling tariffs and approximately 21 days to get designs made
and delivered, 43 days if American material is used.
Retailers drive the industry and - in a fragmented and very competitive marketplace they are moving quickly to address its longstanding logistics problems. Increasingly, they
are turning to suppliers to respond faster to better quality information, including the use
of systems such as Product Lifecycle Management (PLM). Kurt Salmon Associates (Rubman and del Corrado, 2009), consultants to the industry, have highlighted that many
retailers have embraced the concept of integrating retailer PLM and supplier sourcing
systems, including JC Penney and Guess Inc. Real-time collaboration is essential to driv­
ing product development in the industry. Also a shorter product development lead time
enables the delay of design and colour decisions to maximise the on-trend opportunity.
Kuhel (2002) proposes an apparel supply chain of the future that is based on continu­
ous replenishment, which we have adapted. Let us assume a designer and retailer of
fashion apparel is situated in the north-eastern USA. A new range has been designed,
and early sales are encouraging. These early sales figures are used to refine forecasts
quickly, and to prime the logistics pipeline with a flow of product that matches expected
demand. After this, it is essential to regulate the flow of finished goods to match actual
demand. This is how it is done.
As soon as an item is purchased, the retailer collates the electronic point of sale (EPOS)
data from its stores, and sends the data upstream. The 'pull' signal (Chapter 6) goes
back all the way to the yarn manufacturer. Figure 8.6 represents the path that a garment
m ight take from concept to delivery. Six stages are involved.
1 Planning: apparel retailer determines design for a product, evaluates costing with the
supplier and then sends demand data and forecast upstream. These signals set the
supply chain in motion. Later, once the product has gone to market, a web-based link
from the retailer's EPOS system to the manufacturer triggers replenishment responses.
2 Raw material: suppliers respond to demand signals via phone, fax, email or integrated
system. Raw cotton is compressed into bales, and fitted with radio frequency identifi­
cation device (RFID) tags (see Section 6.3.1) to specify source and type.
3 Fabric: manufacturers weave and ship product in response to demand from the
retailer. Inventory/shipment tracking starts here. In-transit data are passed down­
stream via the internet or integrated system workflow.
4 Assembly: fabrics and trims come together at the final assembly plant, which in this
example is situated in the Caribbean. (Manufacturers situated within short shipping
times of the USA are favoured over Far East suppliers.) The plant has an ERP system
that processes orders received electronically. Finished goods are assembled and barcoded by store prior to dispatch. All suppliers to the apparel retailer use compatible
or integrated systems.
5 Distribution: the product is shipped by container to the retailer's national distribution
centre (NDC). Here, store orders are cross-docked using the barcode to identify the
destination store. They are then forwarded to regional distribution centres (RDCs)
that serve 50-100 stores.
6 Retail: as items are purchased, EPOS triggers replenishment responses.

8.2 Choosing the right supply relationships
Key issues: W hat types of supply relationships can be adopted? How can each type

of relationship be tailored to different types of product?

There are many possible types of relationship in the supply chain. A development
of Sako's view m entioned in the introduction to this chapter is that the different
options can be viewed in the form of a continuum. This can range from arm's
length, where the relationship is conducted through the marketplace with price as
its foundation, to vertical integration, where the relationship is cemented through
ownership. Vertical integration can extend for one or more tiers and its direction




may be upstream, downstream or both. A continuum of relationship options is
shown in Figure 8.7. Each of these relationship styles has motivating factors that
drive development and that govern the operating environment. The duration,
breadth, strength and closeness of the relationship vary from case to case and
over time.

Figure 8.7

Relationship styles continuum

(Source: After Cooper and Gardiner, 1993)

A focal firm is unlikely to have the same type of relationship with all of its cus­
tomers and suppliers. The firm may adopt a range of styles: choosing which type
of relationship to adopt in a given supply chain situation is an im portant strate­
gic issue. Kraljic's purchase portfolio matrix (described in Section 9.3) segments
supply items on the basis of supplier risk and the buyer's strength (or power)
in the relationship, and this can help to determine the appropriate relationship
with suppliers. For example, grocery retailers often adopt an arm's-length style for
'own brand' goods, such as kitchen paper, where there are many available sup­
pliers and buyer power is high-termed leverage items by Kraljic. To obtain lowest
price solutions, grocery retailers use online auctions (Smart and Harrison, 2003).
Strategic alliances are used often for relationships that do not strictly fall under
the umbrella of buyer-supplier relationships. For example, the alliance between
Tesco Express and Esso fuel stations was used to develop the station forecourts.
Companies tend to deal with a large num ber of suppliers, even after the supply
base has been rationalised (which is described in Section 9.2). Treating them all in
the same way fails to recognise that some have different needs from others. Dif­
ferentiating the role of suppliers and applying appropriate practices towards them
allows a focal firm to target purchasing and supply chain managem ent resources
to better effect.
A popular view is that Japanese companies consider all of their tier 1 suppliers
as partners. This is not really true: for example, Japanese automotive m anufac­
turers do not regard all of their suppliers as equal. In fact amongst the typical
100-200 tier 1 suppliers to an OEM, only about a dozen will enjoy partnership
status. Typically, these elite few tend to be large organisations. Inspired by the
Japanese version of supply relationships with partners, outlined in the introduc­
tion to this chapter under Sako's 'obligational' description, Western automotive
manufacturers have been developing their own versions. The model for these has
been the keiretsu structure shown in Figure 8.8, where a limited num ber of lead
suppliers, such as Robert Bosch and Delphi (or the partner module suppliers in
the Smart Car Case study 7.3), are responsible for managing their portion of the
inbound supply chain and also have developed sophisticated marketing, product
development and logistics capabilities.


The extent to which companies have undertaken restructuring of their supply
chain through selection of lead suppliers, whilst demoting the majority to tier 2,
is exceptional. Even in the early 1990s, two-thirds of companies were reported
to be reducing their supplier base. Anecdotal accounts of the reductions abound.
For example, Sun Microsystems was reported to have consolidated the top 85 per
cent of its purchasing spend from across 100 suppliers in 1990 to just 20 a few
years later.
Case study 8.5 explains some of the dynamics in automotive inbound supply
chains, and the changing roles and responsibilities of suppliers.
CASE STUDY

8.5

Automotive supply chains: a range of inbound
logistics solutions
Automotive assemblers and their inbound supply chains have developed many solutions
to orchestrate the manufacturing and delivery of the thousands of parts that go to make
up a vehicle. The many potential inbound logistics solutions are summarised in Figure 8.8.

Figure 8.8

Evolving inbound supply relationships

Changes are of increasing value to the vehicle assemblers, where the complexity of
the logistics operation has been greatly downsized by reducing the number of tier 1
suppliers and broadening their responsibilities. Yet the ability of the assemblers to cus­
tomise their finished products has increased. Quality consistency is expected at 50 ppm,
whilst demanding price reduction targets are the norm.

Supplier delivers CIF (carriage, insurance and freight)
The supplier delivers the ordered parts to the assembler's factory, and includes the dis­
tribution costs in the piece part price.




A ss e m b le r collects ex-works

The assembler subcontracts the process of parts collection from a num ber of sup­
pliers visited on a daily frequency. Parts are taken to a consolidation centre, where
they are decanted into trailers destined fo r different assembly plants. An exam­
ple is the Ford operation run by Exel at Birmingham in the UK. Parts collections
are made from the Midlands region of the UK, and dispatched to 22 Ford plants
around Europe.

Automotive supplier community
This is a dedicated co-location of suppliers in the region of dedicated vehicle manufac­
turers. The big difference from all the other integration types is that deliveries are made
to more than one vehicle assembly plant. An example for more than one OEM plant
is the BMW Innovation Estate in Wackersdorf where several suppliers provide parts for
four BMW sites.

On-site distribution centre
Instead of delivering parts directly into the assembler's plant, the logistics partner may
deliver into a distribution centre positioned close to the assembler's plant. The advan­
tages are much more controlled inbound parts movements into the plant. The assembler
is able to call up parts that are needed for a relatively short time period, thus improving
material flow into the plant and reducing vehicle congestion. Additional value-adding
activities may also be carried out in the DC. Thus, for example, suppliers carry out some
final assembly and sequencing tasks in the new Integrated Logistics Centre at BMW,
Cowley.

Supply centres
These are co-located supplier clusters on site and could be part invested by the VM
and service provider (3PL). Supplier proximity enables late module configuration with
smooth material flow. BMW Leipzig uses an electrical conveyor system to connect exter­
nal and internal suppliers to the assembly line.

Chain logistics
Here the objective is to increase the speed of the inbound supply chain. If not
planned and managed, drivers' hours regulations across Europe can lead to waste
as the supply chain stops to allow for rests. The higher the speed of inbound sup­
ply, the lower the stock that needs to be held at the assembly plant. A useful further
advantage is that the higher the speed, the less packaging and fewer containers
are needed in the supply chain. An example of chain logistics is the ALUK opera­
tion th a t supports the Toyota plant at Burnaston in the UK. Parts movements from
a supplier in southern Spain are planned in four-hour stages, where the full trailer
is swapped for an em pty one in a similar fashion to the Pony Express in the days of
the Wild West!


Supplier park
A supplier park is a cluster of suppliers located outside but close to a final assembly plant;
popular w ith JIS suppliers and associated with new assembly plants linked to supplier
by conveyor belts, tunnels or bridges. (JIS = just-in-sequence: the capability to supply
a module in accordance w ith the drumbeat requirements of an assembler.) Major tier
1 subassembly manufacturers are positioned on a supplier park close to the assembly
hall. Major subassemblies are then sequenced into the assembly hall in response to a
'drumbeat' (based on the master schedule - see Chapter 6), which identifies the precise
specification of the next body to be dropped onto the trim and final assembly track.
Suppliers then have a finite amount of time to complete assembly and deliver to the
point of use on the track. An example here is the Exel operation at the VW-Seat plant at
Martorell near Barcelona, where material movements on the supplier park are specified
and orchestrated by means of Exel's IT systems.

Modules
The VW-Seat plant at Martorell demonstrates a further advance in logistics thinking. In­
stead of delivering a large number of subassemblies, why not get the tier 1 suppliers to
coordinate all the parts needed to produce a complete module that then simply can be
bolted onto the car? Product variety can be increased by customisation of the modules.
The advantages are illustrated in Figure 8.9.

Figure 8.9

Modularisation: doing more with less

Modular designs offer less WIP and a considerably downsized process for the assem­
bler, and greater variety for the customer. Downsizing of the assembly process means
that it is shorter, and can be positioned closer to customer demand. Complexity can
then be added later in the pipeline between customer order and delivery of the specified
car into the customer's hands - a concept called postponed variety. The term synchro­
nous supply has been used to describe the delivery of modules not just at the correct
quality and correct time, but on a real-time basis with the assembler and with the added
challenge of zero safety stock. The condominium approach goes a step further in inte­
gration. In this case the suppliers reside and operate under the same roof as the vehicle




3 22

Chapter 8 • Integrating the supply chain

manufacturers. Due to outsourcing and the lean management, VMs often do not need
adjacent space at the final assembly track and can thus offer their factory space to sup­
pliers. Suppliers then assemble their own modules inside the assembly area. An example
for the condominium is the Ford Industrial Complex at Camacari in Brazil.

M odular consortia
This is the highest possible integration step for suppliers in the automotive industry. The
whole assembly operation is divided into separate modules, w ith a supplier responsible
for each. Therefore, the suppliers not only assemble the modules, but they also perform
part of the final vehicle assembly.
The VW bus and truck plant in Brazil is an experiment in the further development
of the modular concept. The truck assembly operation has been divided into seven
modules, with a supplier responsible for each. All the direct workers are on the sup­
plier's payroll, and the supplier not only assembles the module, but also performs final
assembly of the vehicle. The assembler's task has been downsized to engineering, de­
sign, supervision and administration. The Mercedes plant at Hambach in France, which
produces the micro compact Smart Car, divides the vehicle into five main modules. Sev­
en suppliers are fully integrated into the final assembly plant, whilst 16 non-integrated
suppliers deliver submodules and parts. The whole information system - which supports
manufacturing, logistics and distribution - is outsourced to Accenture.

Implications for suppliers
The demands on tier 1 suppliers increase in proportion to the various logistics solutions
described earlier. A clear trend towards supplier parks and modularisation can be seen in
the logistics strategies of automotive assemblers. Increasingly, tier 1 suppliers are being
expected to control subsequent tiers in the supply chain, whilst ensuring delivery and
quality to the assembler. At the same time, challenging cost reduction targets are being
set, whilst the whole process is facilitated by tier 1 outbound defect levels that are less
than 50 ppm. Many suppliers question whether the draconian demands for 'cost down'
targets are compatible with such defect levels.
Four distinct stages can be seen in the development of capabilities by tier 1 suppliers:
•

•

•

Tier 1 basic: suppliers with inhouse design capability and project management

capability who can ensure timely delivery and reasonable quality reliability (50 ppm).
An example would be a tyre manufacturer who holds four-five days' stock and who
delivers to set time windows: that is, limited logistics capability.
Tier 1 synchro: suppliers who provide all of the basic capabilities, but with virtually
no safety stock. Additional capabilities for the supplier are synchro logistics and IT
expertise, which is closely integrated with the assembler, greater flexibility and more
secure emergency procedures. They operate through 'clone' plants that are situ­
ated on supplier parks no more than 10 minutes' travel time from the assembler's
production line.
Tier 0.5: full service providers, who integrate component manufacturing through
supply chain management to achieve the optimum design of a given module. They
carry out pre-emptive market research and develop innovative designs through shelf
engineering (designs that are prepared proactively in advance of need and placed



•

'on the shelf', thus saving time in the event that the need does arise). They are
partners in major cost reduction projects at each model change, and in continuous
improvement projects in between.
Tier 0: the highest possible integration. In addition to tier 0.5 responsibilities, the
tier 0 supplier is responsible for a vehicle manufacturer's main assembly operations
divided into separate modules, w ith a tier 0 supplier responsible for each. Therefore,
the supplier performs final VM module assembly operations. Final VM assembly line
work retention is a matter of the VM's strategic choice but it could be performed by
the tier 0, as exhibited online by supplier Magna for BMW.

There is a substantial passing of risk from the assembler to the tier 1 supplier at each
stage. Increasingly, the supplier takes responsibility for designing and developing new
products of increasing complexity in advance of new model programmes. And there is
no guarantee that the supplier will get the work, because competitive tenders are issued
for each new model. This forces suppliers to keep primary manufacturing and core busi­
ness at a 'home' location, and to construct low-cost, late-configuration 'postponement'
plants near the OEM's assembly hall to enable synchro deliveries. The decision by BMW
to switch R50 (Mini) assembly from Longbridge to Cowley left a number of suppliers
with £2 million synchro assembly units in the wrong place.
The strategic dilemma for tier 1 suppliers who currently supply the assemblers directly
is whether to expand into system integrators (tier 0.5), or to become indirect suppli­
ers to such organisations. Siegfried Wolf of Magna International described the tier 0.5
transition as follows:
To become part of this new tier, companies will require a worldwide pres­
ence, global sourcing, programme management, technology, JIT and JIS
know-how and specialist production knowledge. They will also require a high
level of R&D spend.
So, after tier 0.5, where do the competitive challenges lie? Tier 2 suppliers still will
be largely low-overhead, product-based companies that have limited service capability.
Price pressure will continue to be severe, and return on sales often little above break­
even. Tier 2 suppliers often cannot afford expensive inspection and test resources, so
defect levels will continue to be relatively high, often in the range 1,000-2,000 ppm
(i.e. 1-2 per cent). This will present major challenges for tier 0.5 suppliers, who must
also guarantee delivery reliability to the assembly track, and a module that fits perfectly
at all times.
As an example of tier 0.5 evolution, the joint venture between Canada's Magna
International and Japan's Calsonic Kansei ('Magna Kansei') produces the complete
fascia ('cockpit module') for the Nissan Micra at a new facility close to Nissan's Wash­
ington plant in north-east England. Sales of the join t venture have almost trebled as
it assumes responsibility for all of the components and subassemblies that make up
the module. Calsonic Kansei designed, developed and tested the Micra fascia from a
Nissan-engineered concept design. Co-location of supplier engineers at the Nissan
development HQ in Atsugi City meant that Nissan product development teams super­
vised the design and development process. Magna Kansei assumes responsibility for
parts it makes itself, for sourcing externally made parts, and for final module assembly
and shipment JIS to the Nissan plant. There are 32 tier 2 suppliers: 18 are imposed,
where Nissan sets the price and commercial details. The rest are nominated by Magna




Kansei. This effectively limits the amount of integration that can take place at the de­
sign stage. Imposed suppliers that have been selected mainly on price act as barriers
for improvement of quality capability.

8.3 Strategic partnerships in the supply chain
Key issue: W hat are partnerships, and w hat are their advantages and disadvan­

tages?

So far, we have used the term 'partners' in a supply chain to apply to all firms
th at are involved in a given network. Here, we review the added value that
'strategic partnerships' may bring, assuming the conventional idea th at these
are long-term, rather th an the short-term agile partnerships (discussed in
Section 7.2.4). Generally, strategic partnerships are cooperative relationships that
have been characterised as being based upon:
• the sharing of information;
• trust and openness;
• coordination and planning;
• mutual benefits and sharing of risks;
• a recognition of mutual interdependence;
• shared goals;
• compatibility of corporate philosophies.

8.3.1

Economic justification for partnerships
Entering into a partnership with a company, to whatever extent, implies a transi­
tion away from the rules of the open marketplace and towards alternatives. These
different structures must demonstrate benefits otherwise they will not deliver
competitive advantage.
Open market relationships are typified by short-term contracts, arm's-length
relations, little joint developm ent and m any suppliers per part. Observing
that Japanese practice - and consequently the 'lean' model of supply - differs


significantly from this indicates that other, non-market mechanisms must be
operating.
The Japanese tend to infuse their transactions with the non-economic qualities
of comm itm ent and trust. These characteristics are im portant in successful part­
nerships. Whilst this may increase transaction costs and risks, it appears that these
'non-economic qualities' help to secure other economic and strategic advantages
that are difficult to achieve through the open market system.

8.3.2 Advantages of partnerships
Within partnerships, savings come in the form of reduced negotiations and draw­
ing up of separate contracts, reduced monitoring of supplier soundness, including
supply quality, and increased productivity. These are accompanied by strategic
advantages of shortened lead times and product cycles, and conditions amenable
to longer-term investment.
These advantages, however, need to be set against the problems that can be
associated with the introduction of comm itm ent and trust.

8.3.3 Disadvantages of partnerships
Some of the examples of potential disadvantages of partnerships include the
following:
• the inability to price accurately qualitative matters such as design work;
• the need for organisations to gather substantial information about potential
partners on which to base decisions;
• the risk of divulging sensitive information to competitors;
• p o te n tia l o p p o r tu n ism b y suppliers o n th e basis th a t th e y are 'lock ed in' and
th e co sts o f th e cu sto m er sw itc h in g suppliers are lik ely t o b e h ig h .

In the long term, there are supply risks when companies enter into partner­
ships. With the outsourcing of the R&D of components and subsystems, buyers
benefit from the decreased investment they have to make. Working with suppli­
ers who fund their own R&D leads to their earlier involvement in new product
development where buyers benefit from suppliers' ability to cut costs and devel­
op better-performing products. However, this scenario leads to greater buyer risk
owing to dependence on a smaller num ber of suppliers for designs, and also the
potential for opportunism through the smaller num ber of other companies able
to compete with the incum bent (partnering) suppliers for their work.

Consider the reasons why a company would wish to enter into a partnership with a customer or
supplier. List the advantages and disadvantages you can think of.




8.4 Implementing strategic partnerships
Key issue: W hat are the barriers to achieving strategic partnerships in the supply

chain?

A strategic partner is a company with whom a focal firm has decided to devel­
op a long-term, collaborative relationship. 'Collaboration' may be the ultimate
objective of a num ber of phases through which a supply relationship may evolve.
A transition route from open-market negotiation to collaboration is shown in
Figure 8.10.

Figure 8.10

The transition from open-market negotiations to collaboration

(Source: After Speckman, et al., 1998)

Obligational aspects of the relationship increase from cooperation to collabo­
ration. Coordination can be defined in terms of establishing 'rules of the road'
whereby partners can work together. This is the key step to integrating the supply
chain. Collaboration goes beyond integration by including long-term comm it­
ments to technology sharing and to closely integrated planning and control sys­
tems. The two firms become interdependent, that is, they adapt to each other and
develop common logistics governance processes. Case study 8.6 describes what
happened in one such relationship.

A strategic partnership at WheatCo-ChemCo
WheatCo and ChemCo are two US chemical corporations, both leaders in their fields and
with similar sales (around $2 billion per year). Eight years prior to our study, the two com­
panies formed a 20-year strategic partnership with the objective of gaining competitive
advantage through mutual access to low cost raw materials. One outcome was the es­
tablishment in the UK of a small ChemCo facility (70 employees) on a large WheatCo site
(700 employees). The ChemCo facility was located next to the WheatCo 'Basics' unit, and
linked by a bridge. Whilst a fence divided the two plants, selected employees were able to
pass between the two by means of swipe card access. A ChemCo manager commented:
We are symbiotically linked. If you take away the ChemCo and WheatCo
signs, we're really one site... we have a relationship and it's an umbilical cord.
ChemCo was dedicated to production of a chemical additive used in the production
of rubbers, paints and other compositions. The feedstock used in the ChemCo process
was supplied by the WheatCo 'Basics' unit. The manufacturing process of the additive
generated a gaseous by-product, which was recycled back into the WheatCo feedstock.


Half of the additive made on the ChemCo site was sold to WheatCo's 'Rubber' unit,
and the rest to other customers in Europe and the USA (see Figure 8.11). The two firms
thereby formed a 'closed loop' supply chain - whereby they were both customer of,
and supplier to, each other. The production processes operated on a round-the-clock
basis and there was very little buffer stock within the supply loop: 'If we have a problem,
then ChemCo has a problem 10 seconds later'. This close interdependency of logistics
processes meant that operating teams were in contact on a 24-hour basis. There was
a direct telephone link between WheatCo and ChemCo operators to allow easy com­
munication and instant warning of changes in either of the processes, or to inform of
production stoppages.

Figure 8.11

The WheatCo-ChemCo relationship

The supply relationship was multifaceted, with interactions taking place at many
levels. Locally it included plant management, engineers and operators. In the USA, an
executive contact was appointed by each firm to manage the relationship at a strate­
gic level. This applied in particular to the global contract agreement, which provided
the commercial terms for the relationship. A joint steering committee determined the
local operational strategy for the relationship and provided guidelines to two other joint
teams: 'quality improvement' and 'technical'.
Eight years after the supply relationship began, the upstream WheatCo process had
become unreliable. There were also quality issues w ith the chemical additive supplied
by ChemCo, which impacted rubber production at the downstream WheatCo unit. In
the early days of the relationship, operators had been encouraged to socialise through
company events and plant visits. This allowed a common language to be developed,
through interaction:
'We may spend a day there, they spend a day here,' and thus, 'We didn't
need to communicate where if something did go wrong they would auto­
matically take care of it.'
More recently, the relationship had developed some disturbing arm's-length charac­
teristics. Both partners were implementing internal programmes which drew attention




away from the supply relationship. At shop floor level, less interaction and fewer visits
were allowed. This was made worse by employee turnover. As a consequence, operators
felt that they could no longer 'p u t a face to a name'. Lack of interaction, together with
the recurring technical issues, put a strain on the overall relationship. Recognising that
a blame culture had developed, site management from WheatCo and ChemCo decided
to organise a 'Team Day' to ensure that operators, shift managers and engineers from
the three manufacturing units could meet, socialise and be trained on the specifics of
the supply loop. However, the 'Team Day' was cancelled due to a company-wide work­
force reduction plan announced by WheatCo: given the circumstances, such a socialisa­
tion event was seen as inappropriate.

And here it is im portant to offer a word of warning. It is apparent from our
research (Koulikoff-Souviron and Harrison, 2007) that strategic partnerships are
very demanding and resource intensive. So it is necessary to determine where
is the most appropriate point along the route in Figure 8.10 for a given supply
relationship. There is no point in pursuing a partnership just because it is 'more to


the right' in Figure 8.10. In some cases, as stated earlier, an arm's-length relation­
ship based on open-market negotiations will be most appropriate.

8.4.1

Lambert's partnership model
Douglas Lambert established a partnership model (1996), shown in Figure 8.12,
which defines three levels of partnership (similar to those previously shown in
Figure 8.10) from type I to type III, representing increasing levels of collaboration,
as illustrated in Figure 8.13 and summarised in Table 8.1.

Figure 8.13

Lambert's model is based on the principle that more collaboration is not nec­
essarily better and that what's im portant is the appropriateness of the relation­
ship. It is possible to 'over manage' relationships by investing more resources
(employee's time, information systems, etc.) than the value the relationship can
generate. The model aims to guard against this possibility, or for that matter the
reverse - under-managed relationships - by assessing two key factors: drivers and
facilitators, as outlined in Table 8.2.
• Drivers: compelling reasons to partner, which are the expected benefits from a
closer relationship.
• Facilitators: supportive environmental factors that enhance partnership growth
by increasing the likelihood of its success.

techniques of the tw o companies will match

Probability that both parties have the skills and
predisposition needed for mutual relationship
building

Probability that the relationship will result in
profit growth or reduced variability in profit

Probability that the parties are similar in terms
of various im portant factors (e.g. relative size in
terms of sales, technological sophistication) that
will affect the success of the relationship

The strength of the drivers and facilitators is assessed in terms of probabilities
that translate into points, which determines the propensity to partner, as shown
in the matrix in Figure 8.14.

Figure 8.14

Crucial to the success of the partnership model is that it is applied through a
two-day workshop where cross-functional, multi-level teams from each of the
potentially partnering organisations attend. Another powerful aspect is that the
drivers (which effectively represent each organisation's expected benefits from
the relationship) are identified and scored selfishly and independently by the two
companies, to ensure that neither company is inhibited. Ultimately, however, the
lowest score is used to type the relationship because this is what will drive the
level to which partnering is possible.


Once the relationship is 'typed' - the target relationship is identified - then the
current relationship is assessed against eight components, such as planning and
communication, and an action plan is jointly established to move the relation­
ship towards the appropriate level.
The Lambert model has been tested on hundreds of companies since it was
established in 1996, such as McDonald's, Xerox, Whirlpool and 3M, m any of
whom have applied it to a number of their more strategic relationships. Despite
this, the partnership model remains unchanged and has proven to be an endur­
ing approach to improving partnerships, such that they deliver more value to
both companies.
We now consider the barriers to developing partnerships in the first place.

8.4.2

Barriers to developing strategic partnerships
The transition from multiple sourcing and arm's-length negotiation of short-term,
purchase-price-allocated contracts to a partnership based on cooperation, collab­
oration, trust and comm itm ent requires a supply chain process to be put in place,
which needs designing, developing, optimising and managing. A key step in achiev­
ing this is to ensure that supplier development and purchasing teams are fully
involved in the changes.
Failure to do this often leads to purchasing executives undertaking behaviour in­
compatible with fostering successful strategic partnerships. Whilst many are familiar
with - and voice support for - partnerships, in practice their approach and practices
are not supportive. Barriers that have been identified include the following:
• There is an inappropriate use of power over the supply chain partner.
• Buyers focus on their own company's self-interest, often because they are incentivised to do so.
• There is a focus on the negative implications of entering into partnership.
• Whilst buyers value trust, comm itm ent and reliability, they continue to be
opportunistic and seek gains at their partner's expense.
• Price is viewed as the key attribute in supplier selection.
These barriers, which are explained below, show that the decision criteria used
by buyers retain a legacy of the traditional approach where the choice of lowest
price remains the most defining characteristic. Unless such behaviour is changed,
it prevents supply chain relationships from developing beyond a crude applica­
tion of commercial power, where the free market is used to instil discipline and
promote a supply base in which it is assumed that the fit survive. An explanation
of the barriers follows.
Power

The ability of one member in the supply chain to control another member at a
different level can be detrimental to the overall supply network, and can provide
a source of conflict. Conflict is associated clearly with power, arising when one
organisation impedes the achievement of the goals of another. For example, in




retailing, shelf space is a key resource that has potentially conflicting implica­
tions for the retailer and for its suppliers. The retailer looks for maximum return
on space and contribution to its image, whilst the supplier seeks maximum shelf
space, trial for new products and preference over competitors.
Focus on negative implications o f partnership

Buyers consider the benefits gained through heightened dependence on a smaller
number of suppliers less favourably, and tend to highlight the risks. Buyers also
consistently view the cost-saving aspects of supply chain m anagem ent as more
im portant than the revenue-enhancing benefits.
Opportunism

A key issue that prevents partnerships from enduring appears to be the gap
between the strategic requirements of long-term partnerships and tactical-level
manoeuvring - in particular, opportunism. It is a problem to resolve this, given
that the dimensions that characterise close working relationships also provide
both opportunity and increased incentive for opportunistic behaviour. This is
caused when partners cannot easily obtain similar benefits outside the relation­
ship and when specialised investments have been made. Buyers often assume
that suppliers will take advantage if they become too important, and as such act
to prevent this. The consequences for the partnership relationship come second
in their considerations.
Self-interest

Companies face difficulties in establishing and m aintaining supply chain part­
nerships. Even in the automotive industry, often considered the supply chain
exemplar, companies keen to implement single sourcing continue to multisource,
particularly for non-critical items and commodity items. They rarely enter into
collaboration, even when the customer is dependent on the supplier - that is,
when the product is strategically important and alternatives are limited - and
instead set their self-interest higher than the need to act according to comm on
best interest.
Focus on price

The focus on price may be due in some part to buyers having trouble valuing
matters such as know-how, technological capability, a particular style of pro­
duction or a spirit of innovation, and therefore being unable to price them
accurately. Their concern that suppliers may act opportunistically tends to lead them
to avoid entering into areas where these factors prevail. Significantly, one of the
key areas that feature these traits is that of design and development. It seems that,
in this area, buyers find it extremely difficult to measure designer performance or
the am ount of productive time spent during design, and therefore feel the need
to guard against high bids from suppliers.


8.5 Managing supply chain relationships
Key issue: How can broader-based relationships be form ed between trading

partners in the supply chain?

8.5.1

Creating closer relationships
The traditional supplier-customer relationship has been limited to contact pri­
marily between the customer's buyer and the supplier's salesperson. Other func­
tions, such as information systems, are kept very much at arm's length. Indeed,
the customer's buyer argues that dealings with the supplier should go through
only him or her: in that way, they ensure that sensitive communications, such as
those affecting price, are limited to a single channel.
This traditional style of relationship ('bow-tie') is contrasted with a multiplecontact model ('diamond') alternative in Figure 2.6. In the 'diam ond' version,
contacts between different functions are positively encouraged, and the arm'slength relationship of the 'bow-tie' is replaced by active relationship manage­
m ent and supplier development processes. This is exemplified by the remarkable
changes in the supplier portfolio at the UK high street retailer Bhs. In the early
1990s Bhs had over 1,000 suppliers. Now it has just 50. But the nature of the re­
lationship with the 50 is quite different. There are now multi-level connections
between the supply chain players, and a high level of electronic collaboration.
There is also a much greater involvement by the remaining 50 suppliers in highlevel strategy development at Bhs.
We found that even the closest and most interdependent supply relationships
in practice exhibit a tension between togetherness (a tendency to see the require­
ments for working together in the supply relationship) and separateness (the
frustration of joint work or the positive aspects of working separately, KoulikoffSouviron and Harrison, 2007). Figure 8.15 shows this tension as an arrow that
connects two contrasting behaviours.

Figure 8.15

Creating closer relationships

(Source: After Koulikoff-Souviron and Harrison, 2007)

We concluded th at logistics disciplines provide a focus for coordination
around which other aspects of a supply relationship revolve. If failures such
as product quality and process breakdowns did n o t happen, th en adjustm ents
would not be necessary. It is the failures inherent in the m anagem ent of physical




product flows that make these adjustments necessary, and which encourage the
partners to work together. M anagement of physical flows demands heavy-duty
coordination m echanisms between supply partners. This can be overlooked by
senior managers - who tend to focus on contractual aspects of a relationship,
and to overlook its procedural implications and the necessary resource com ­
m itm ent.
Coordination manifests itself as a tension between m echanisms that bring
the partners together - hence stressing the benefits of achieving shared suc­
cess - as well as mechanisms that drive the partners apart. Separateness can
be derived either from a failure to coordinate (because of various technical or
organisational reasons) or from the need to focus on the requirements o f the
internal organisation.

However attractive such processes of bonding may appear, in practice the
organisational boundaries and vested interests inhibit the rate at which rela­
tionships deepen. These have been described as a series of factors, as a result of
research in the auto industry.

8.5.2 Factors in forming supply chain relationships
Lamming (1993) proposed nine factors for analysing customer-supplier relation­
ships, which have been modified and extended below:
• W h at the order winners are: for example, price, product range, technology
advantage, superior product quality.
• How sourcing decisions are m a de : is it, for example, competitive tender, auctions,
supplier accreditation or sole source?
• The nature o f electronic collaboration: is it transactional, information sharing or
collaborative?
• The attitude to capacity planning: is this seen as the supplier's problem, as a
problem for the buyer (tactical make/buy/additional sources) or as a shared
strategic issue?
• Call-off requirements: does the customer (for example) alter schedules with no
notice, require JIT delivery against specified time windows, or require synchro­
nised deliveries of major subassemblies to the point of use?
• Price negotiations: are price reductions imposed by the buyer subject to game
playing by both parties, the result of joint continuous improvement projects,
etc.?
• Managing product quality: does the customer help the supplier to improve pro­
cess capability? Are aggressive targets (e.g. 50 ppm defects) set by the customer?
Is the supplier responsible for quality of incoming goods and warranty of the
parts in service?
• Managing research and development: does the customer impose new designs and
have the supplier follow instructions? Does the supplier become involved in
new product development? Is the supplier expected to design and develop the
complete product for the next model?


• The level o f pressure: how far does the customer place pressure for improvement
on the supplier to avoid complacency (e.g. 30 per cent price reduction in the
next two years)?
W ithin the European auto industry, the most significant factor seems to be the
last. Overcapacity amongst the assemblers has created massive pressures for cost
reduction. The supply chain accounts for 70-80 per cent of an assembler's costs,
so this is the primary target. Figure 8.16 shows the inventory profile for volume
assemblers in Europe (Holweg and Miemczyk, 2002).

Figure 8.16

Automotive supply chain: inventory profile

(Source: After Holweg and Miemczyk, 2002)

It is apparent that assemblers have been using their power in the supply chain
to optimise inventories around their own processes. Meanwhile, component
manufacturers upstream and dealers downstream are carrying huge inventories.
Dealer networks were holding some €18 billion of stock in disused airfields around
Europe! Whilst long-term mutually beneficial relationships are often talked about,
the reality can be very different.

8.6 Supplier networks
Key issue: W hat are supplier associations and the Japanese keiretsu?

Supplier networks can be formal or informal groups of companies whose com­
m on interest is that they all supply a particular customer, or support an entire
industry. Four such networks are considered here:
• supplier associations;
• Japanese keiretsu;
• Italian districts;

• Chinese industrial areas.

8.6.1

Supplier associations
Aitken (1998) defines a supplier association as:
The network o f a com pany's im portant suppliers brought together for the pur­
pose o f coordination and d evelopm ent. Through the supplier association forum
this com p any provides training and resource for production and logistics process
im provem ents. The association also provides the opportunity for its m em bers to
im prove the quality and frequency o f com m un ication s, a critical factor for im prov­
in g operational performance.

Supplier associations may be traced back to the late 1930s with the oldest
known group being one linked to Japanese automotive manufacturer Toyota.
This early group consisted of 18 suppliers producing basic commodity items such
as screws, nuts and bolts. These suppliers formed the group for the benefit of
themselves. The Toyota organisation itself did not perform an active role in the
beginning of the association. However, the distant role of Toyota was to change,
as raw materials became scarce during the Second World War. As part of wartime
control by the Japanese government, small and medium-sized firms were directed
to supply larger firms, which were being utilised as distributors of raw material by
the government. Prescribing the flow of materials forced the m ovem ent of scarce
raw materials to key manufacturers. Through this direct interventionist approach
the government tried to force assemblers and the subcontractors to work together
to increase the efficiency of the supply chain.
The policy employed by the governm ent therefore encouraged assemblers to
establish links with suppliers to ensure com ponent supplies. The carrot and stick
approach of the governm ent assisted the foundation of several associations. The
institutionalist approach by governm ent succeeded in determining the future
structure of the supply chain for Japanese automotive companies. Japanese car
assemblers changed their modus operandi to align w ith the prevailing govern­
m ental coercive isomorphic forces, thereby obtaining social legitimacy. How­
ever, it was not until the early 1940s that assemblers began to recognise the
potential benefits of becoming active members of the associations. In 1943
Toyota became interested in the m anagem ent of the association. Through the


provision of m anagem ent support Toyota started to develop and improve confi­
dence and trust between members and itself.
There can be many improvement objectives of a supplier association, and these
will vary between associations and industry sectors. Research has identified 10
primary objectives for establishing and developing an association, as shown in
Table 8.3.
Table 8.3

Primary objectives for establishing and developing supplier associations

Objective

Rationale

The provision of manufacturing tools and techniques such
as JIT, k a n b a n and TQM

Improve knowledge and application of best practice tools
and techniques w ithin the supply base

Produce a uniform supply system

Remove m u d a (waste) from the system then standardise
process management in all parts of the supply chain

Facilitate flow of information and strategy formulation

The assembler assists the suppliers in formulating
an improvement strategy by providing best practice
information

Increase trust between buyer and supplier

The result of gaining improvements in the first three
objectives is an improvement in trust

Keep suppliers and customers in touch w ith market need

Assemblers aid their suppliers in understanding the needs
of the customer through sharing market intelligence, sales
plans and development opportunities

Enhance reputation of assembler within supply base

Assemblers attem pt to prove to their suppliers that they
are worth dealing with

Aid smaller suppliers

Some supplier associations are established to aid smaller
associations who could not support the development or
improvement programmes necessary to achieve worldclass manufacturing standards from their own internal
resources

Increase length of trading relationship

Through supporting suppliers in the development of
their operations the assembler needs to invest resources.
Through com m itting resources the assembler increases
the asset specificity of the supplier and it is therefore
im portant that the relationship is maintained

Share development benefits

The association forum supports not only supplier-assembler
improvements but also supplier-supplier knowledge sharing

Provide examples to suppliers of how to develop their
own supply base

The performance of the entire supply chain is improved
by cascading supply chain management technique into it

CASE STUDY

8.7

Supplier association
A major supplier of digital telecommunications systems, which we shall call 'Cymru', had
established a successful manufacturing plant in Wales. The European region had been
restructured into five customer-facing divisions, which would provide major customers




with a single point of contact for integrated solutions. This would in turn focus opera­
tions by key account, and boost Cymru's commitment to quality and customer satisfac­
tion. Cymru's major customer was TELE, a national telecomms service provider. Follow­
ing deregulation of markets in Europe, TELE started to buy telephone handsets in the
global market at prices that were well below those of Cymru. A two-year contract was
replaced by a four-month contract, and call-off quantities became much more uncertain
for Cymru and its suppliers.
In order to compete, Cymru decided that it would have to improve customer service
in terms of availability, speed of new product introduction and cost. A new logistics
programme was conceived whereby Cymru bypassed TELE's internal distribution
structure and delivered direct to TELE's customers. This meant that TELE carried no
inventories and that Cymru took over the distribution task with superior service levels.
TELE signed a five-year deal with Cymru, and both parties enjoyed better margins.
In order to support the better service levels, it was essential that Cymru's supply base
was integrated into the new logistics programme. This meant that the relationship style
(Figure 8.7) would need to be moved from arm's length to strategic. As the procure­
ment manager commented:
I quickly realised that the old way of communicating on a one-to-one basis
would no longer work. I'd never get round the suppliers quickly enough to
get them all in a mindset of what had to change and when.
Suppliers previously had been informed of future plans on a 'need to know' basis
through their organisational 'gatekeepers' in the purchasing department at Cymru.
New work was put out to tender, and the lowest-price bid secured the business.
Setting up a supplier association was viewed as the best way to address the needs and
timescales for changing the supply chain. Suppliers could be involved simultaneously in
reducing lead times from two weeks to two days (receipt of order from TELE to deliv­
ery at end-user's site). This would be achieved through improved responsiveness, both
inbound and outbound. Far Eastern competitors would be unable to match such service
levels and total logistics costs.
In setting up the supplier association, priority was given to suppliers who supplied
parts for final assembly of the telephone, especially those that supplied colour-related
and mechanical parts, which would have maximum impact on lead-time reduction.
Seven tier 1 suppliers and one tier 2 supplier agreed to take part, and the network is
shown in Figure 8.17.

Figure 8.17

Cymru supplier association inbound supply relationships


The Cymru supplier association was therefore formed from a wide variety of compa­
nies, in terms of both size and industry sector. In a marked break with the past, Cymru
kicked off the association with an inaugural meeting that presented confidential product
development and market information. The aim of the association was 'to promote best
practice, improve overall supply chain performance and support product development'.
This was to be achieved by self-help teams committed to sharing knowledge and experi­
ence in an open and cooperative manner. Many suppliers were concerned that the asso­
ciation was being formed 'as a disguise for margin reduction', and were reassured when
Cymru insisted that the main task was cost reduction. More open communications and
an emphasis on mutual cost reduction were seen by suppliers as essential foundations
for the new association.
The initial activity was to benchmark all members to 'gain an understanding of the
strengths and weaknesses of current processes and practices relative to a best practice
model'. Areas for benchmarking were those that Cymru had itself established already as
competitive priorities. They were:
•
•
•
•
•

quality: ppm of components received, goods produced and goods shipped;
productivity: value added per employee, throughput and operation times;
delivery: percentage of deliveries on time to customer and from suppliers;
stock turns: stock turn ratio;
continuous improvement: improvement plans, team activities and employee devel­
opment programmes.

The results of the benchmarking process stimulated much interest amongst the sup­
pliers. The account manager of one of them commented:
Benchmarking is very important. We need to know from the customer what he
thinks of us. How do we rate against other suppliers in the association? I want
to know because it could be I've got something to learn from another supplier.
Following the benchmarking phase, suppliers met every quarter to formulate strategy,
share market and product development information, and share plans for implementing
best practice. The new plans were then deployed within individual supplier companies
by training workshops. In turn, these plans spawned improvement projects aimed at
achieving the competitive priorities.

Question
1 The supplier association described above eventually collapsed. What causes do you
think m ight have led to this collapse?

8.6.2 Japanese keiretsu
One of the Japanese business structures that has received interest from Western
business is the keiretsu. Keiretsu is a term used to describe Japanese business con­
sortia based on cooperation, coordination, joint ownership and control.
The keiretsu possesses the particular characteristic of having ownership and con­
trol based on equity exchanges between supply chain members. Despite the com­
plexities of their ownership structure, keiretsu represents a supply chain model




that helps to explain the organisation of most companies in the automotive and
electronics sectors in Japan.
The supply chain keiretsu is a network in which activities are organised by a lead
firm. The typical supplier networks of large automobile and electronics firms are
managed and led by the major assemblers, as shown in Figure 8.18.

Figure 8.18

Japanese keiretsu structure

(Source: Aitken, 1998)

The formation of keiretsus occurred as a result of the strategy in the 1960s of
assemblers outsourcing subassemblies to increase capacity, leading de facto to the
emergence of a tiered structure. The keiretsu became instrumental in developing
the pyramidal structure of the supply base with its tiered arrangement to ensure
that the assembler works directly with only a reduced num ber of suppliers. These
suppliers in turn take responsibility for managing the next level down, and so on.
The tiered keiretsu arrangement has now become the favourite supply structure in
the automotive industry worldwide.

Activity 8.5
Brazilian-born Carlos Ghosn was dispatched to Nissan after Renault took a 36.8 per cent stake in
the Japanese car maker in 1999. What he has done in turning round Nissan's €15 billion of debt
and chronic losses has sent shock waves through Japanese business thinking. One of his main
targets for change has been the keiretsu system, which he described as a 'gross waste of capital'.
Ghosn has broken up Nissan's keiretsu system, and is reducing the number of suppliers from
1,200 to 600. Masaaki Kanno, head of economic research at JP Morgan's Asian office, is quoted
as saying: 'While many people in Japan realised this system should be changed, it has taken a
foreigner to change it. I am not exaggerating when I say Ghosn is a hero in Japan now. People
believe that he has saved Nissan from death.'
The system that has acted as a model for Western auto inbound logistics is being dismantled
by Nissan. Is this anomalous? Discuss.


8.6.3 Italian districts
A third way of organising supply networks has been popularised and led by indus­
trial districts in Italy (Becattini, 2002). Porter (1990) commented on the strengths
of the Italian ceramic tile 'cluster' in the Sassuolo district in his Competitive Advan­
tage o f Nations. Producers benefited from 'a highly developed set of suppliers, sup­
port industries, services and infrastructure', and the geographic concentration of
firms in the district 'supercharged the whole process'. Districts are characterised
by hundreds or even thousands of small, family-owned firms with a handful of
employees working single shifts. The great majority of firms are led by entrepre­
neurs who are craftsmen, often relying on the most basic planning and control
tools. Concern currently focuses on the ability of districts to adapt to changes in
global competition, as Case study 8.8 explores.

CASE S T U D Y

Supply chain internationalisation in the Marche shoe district
The National Association of Italian Footwear Manufacturers (ANCI - www.anci-calzature.
com) explains, 'The success of the footwear sector in Italy is linked to an enterprising spirit
and to the structure of the sector. The structure is a "w eb" of raw material suppliers, tan­
neries, components, accessories, machinery manufacturers, model makers and designers.
This has resulted in a territorial concentration of firms and the formation of shoe manufac­
turing districts such as Marche, Tuscany, Venetia and Lombardy. The leading position of
the Italian shoe industry is due to superior product quality and high levels of innovation.'
The Marche shoe district is the largest concentration of producers of shoes and acces­
sories in Europe. There are more than 3,000 shoe firms, almost 500 shoe components
firms and more than 100 leather firms employing almost 50,000 workers, with com­
bined sales of over €3 billion. The district is export-orientated, with more than 75 per
cent of production going abroad - mainly to Germany, the USA, Russia and increasingly
to Asia, including China.
District firms are mostly small family businesses with fewer than 20 employees, but
there are also a few larger firms with internationally recognised brands. The district
leader, Della Valle Group, produces high-quality shoes and bags, matching a classic style
design w ith comfort and a sporty look. Traded on the Milan Stock Exchange, it has sales
of €570 million, and has developed strong international brands - such as Tod's, Hogan
and Fay, plus a growing network of directly owned stores. Leading positions in specific
market niches are occupied by Fornari (focused on trendy female teenager shoes with
its brand Fornarina), by Falc (specialising in children's top-quality shoes under Falcotto
and Naturino brand names) and by Santoni (focused on top-quality handmade shoes
with prices up to €1,500). Top fashion firms such as Prada, Dolce & Gabbana and Hugo
Boss have signed licensing agreements w ith Macerata district firms for the production
of their shoe collections. Figure 8.19 shows tw o products from the Santoni website.
The shoe district has developed as an integrated supply network, offering the vast
and competitive range of components and equipment required for making shoes from leather processing to soles moulding or laser cutting. Logistics is simplified by the
geographical concentration of firms in the district and the personal knowledge and trust





Figure 8.19

Italian style from the Santoni Collection

that characterises relationships amongst district entrepreneurs. Flexibility by the small
firms' supply network enables the ups or downs of fashions to be met.
Since the 1990s, however, the district network has had to come to terms w ith an
outsourcing trend to low labour-cost countries that is always a threat to mature and
labour-intensive industries in developed economies. As a result, production of low-cost
shoes has been outsourced almost fully, first to Eastern Europe and then to the Far East.
In low-price product ranges, district companies retain only high-value activities of de­
sign, marketing and distribution in the Macerata district.
Outsourcing has also affected the core district products in medium- to high-quality
footwear. Here, however, foreign partners are involved in only less complex tasks to
preserve Italian style and quality. The result is an increasingly widespread network. Pro­
cessed leather is brought into the district after initial processing in Asia (mainly India and
China). The leather is then checked, cut and prepared to be sent to Eastern Europe for
further processing (mainly to Romania and Albania for sewing and hemming). Prepared
leather is returned to the district for finishing and assembly. Such partial outsourcing called o u tw a rd processing traffic - preserves the high-quality standards of district shoes
whilst cutting down on costs.
This makes logistics a critical activity. Transportation costs per unit have increased,
and responsiveness has been put at risk. This is of particular concern to a business that
is linked to fashion, where season collections and sales campaign deadlines cannot be
missed. Whilst offshore sourcing has led to significantly longer lead times, increasing in­
ventories and lot sizes are not an effective answer. Most district firms offer differentiated
products based on fashion trends, and therefore would face a high risk of mark-downs
at the end of season. Therefore, firms normally order only 25-30 per cent of require­
ments for a seasonal collection from their suppliers on the basis of forecasts, and these
are mainly carry-over models and 'classic' leather. Orders for the rest of the collection
are made in line w ith incoming orders from fashion fairs, distributors and boutiques.


The new international network (including a sales network that is extending progres­
sively towards Asia) has become so complex that even large companies find it difficult
to manage. Leading district firms are tackling logistics issues through increased informa­
tion processing capabilities and through advanced services from logistics service provid­
ers. In order to manage a production network spanning from nearby district suppliers
to Eastern Europe (mainly for shoes) and China (for clothing), Fornari has installed SAPAFS (Apparel and Footwear Solution). This new ERP system has allowed the company to
improve visibility over production planning and tighten control over suppliers. Fornari
has outsourced outbound logistics, and is considering a logistics platform to handle in­
formation exchange for district subcontractors and foreign suppliers to reduce costs, an
RFID system to improve responsiveness to European customers and a logistics network
to support its strong selling presence in China.
However, most district companies are not large enough to become attractive proposi­
tions for IT or logistics service providers. Whilst they can't afford to lose outsourcing op­
portunities, these small firms risk being unable to manage the more complex networks
that result. Moreover, most district entrepreneurs do not fully support the potential
advantages of sharing outsourced services. Since they lack the accounting tools for
getting a complete picture of logistic costs, they do not perceive logistics as a competi­
tive weapon. They care only about emergencies when a rush order is required or when
a planned delivery is late, but dealing with such emergencies becomes more difficult
when distant foreign partners are involved.
Developing the infrastructure, the skills and the mindsets, in order to manage such a
radical change in international supply chain management, is probably the biggest chal­
lenge district companies will face in the next 5-10 years.

8.6.4 Chinese industrial areas
Manufacturing of goods has been extensively transferred to low-cost countries
such as China, and trade between China and Europe has increased dramatically in
the past 20 years. Europe's imports from China have grown by around 21 per cent
per year for the last five years. In 2008, the EU imported €247.6 billion worth of
goods from China (European Commission, 2009). This comprises mainly indus­
trial goods: machinery and transport equipment and miscellaneous manufactured
articles. China imported €78.4 billion from Europe, again mainly manufactured
goods (for example Liu, 2005). China is the EU's second-largest trade partner,
whilst the EU is China's top trade partner. Europe invested some €4.5 billion in
China in 2009.
In order to keep pace with these burgeoning trade flows, China has developed
massive industrial areas. But 'one of the unique characteristics of industrial policy




in China is that it involves government intervention at all levels, from the political
elite all the way down to village leaders' (Liu, 2005). Government intervention has
created another way of organising supply partnerships by means of industrial areas.
First was Shenzhen in Guangdong Province (1980s), then Pudong of Shanghai
(1990s). The latest has been Tianjin, included in China's 11th Five-Year Programme
(2006-10) as part of the country's effort to boost regional development of the Bohai
Gulf Region in particular and the north-east and north-west of China in general.

Binhai New Area - North China's latest international logistics
centre
Located on the coast of east Tianjin, Binhai New Area (BNA) is at the intersection of the
Bohai Economic Belt and Jing-Jin-Ji Metropolitan Circle and Bohai Economic Sphere.
This is also the starting point of the Eurasian Continental Bridge and an important outlet
for countries adjacent to China, as shown in Figure 8.20.

Figure 8.20

Bohai Economic Sphere: BNA is on the coast, near to Tianjin

BNA has been under construction for ten years, and is composed of three functional
areas:
•
•
•

Technological and Economic Development Area (TEDA);
Tianjin Port Free Trade Zone and Tianjin Port;
an integrated administrative area - Binhai New Area Government.


With an area of 2,270 km2, a coastline of 153 km and a population of some 2 million,
the function of BNA is to service the northern regions of China. It is a base for modern
manufacturing and research applications, and a centre for international shipping and
logistics. A clear development plan was formed after continual amendment and optim i­
sation, and the nine functional areas have been defined - such as the advanced manu­
facturing zone, airport industry zone and the Binhai high-tech industry development
zone, shown in Figure 8.21.

Figure 8.21

Nine functional areas

The vision is for BNA to become a focus for the development of new technology in­
dustries and so support the overall development of the whole region. A major advance
has been the location of Airbus A320 production facilities in BNA. The Area's success has
been built around:
•

Location: the Eurasian Continental Bridge to japan and South Korea, and the clos­
est port to Central and Western Asia, Tianjin serves as the link connecting domestic
and foreign markets. Modern logistics development in the new area will support the
constant enlargement of international trade and foreign direct investment.




•

•

•

Excellent facilities: BNA has become China's largest deep-sea port, and its sea routes
connect to more than 400 ports in over 180 countries. The port has a modern EDI net­
work, and benefits from development of an International Trade and Shipment Service
Centre and the Tianjin Electric Port. As one of the four biggest cargo airports in China,
the Area has four channels connected to Europe. Tianjin will be the first international air­
port that can transfer goods from one aircraft to another aircraft or from aircraft to land.
It has an effective highway system and is well connected to the national train network.
Growth: the Area has attracted many part-owned or fully foreign-owned firms. More
than half of the Fortune 500 list of companies have constructed factories in BNA,
which has transformed the Area into a major manufacturing base. Addressing eco­
nomic needs of the 21 st century, BNA is focusing on aerospace, oil and chemical en­
gineering, equipment manufacturing, electronic goods, biomedical, new energy and
materials, light industries and textiles, and defence-related science and technology.
Logistics: The last government plan called for a target for logistics added value of RMB65
billion (€8 billion), taking 58 per cent of the service industry as a whole. To achieve
this goal, BNA is constructing six new logistics bases to form a large-scale, multi-level
logistics network, supplemented by subcentres such as assembly, transit, storage,
processing and distribution. In order to develop a systematic operation of shipment,
harbour and port, Dongjiang Bonded Port Area was constructed. It implements a com­
prehensive international transfer, distribution, storage and related service system.

In spite of these success factors, a number of challenges to building an international
logistics centre remains:
•

•

•

Third party logistics providers: there are more than 20,000 logistics-related firms in
Tianjin, 500 of which are located in the Free Trade Zone - including more than 50
international logistics operators. BNA aims to be a logistics centre of excellence, so
it is important that the best international operators are there in strength. However,
only a few third-party logistics operators are there that can provide integral services,
and few large international logistic firms have their headquarters in Tianjin. It is of
great concern to the government that firms can be persuaded to establish their
headquarters in the new Area.
Construction work: the shipment centre is fundamental to the success of the logistics
centre, but construction work is behind schedule. The two centres - international
shipment and logistics - are seen by the State Council as having consistent goals
due to their overlapping roles. There is a need to develop a more unified plan for
development, with a coordinated policy and infrastructure construction logistics.
The coordination of policy and the relationship between different industries and
adjacent provinces is needed to achieve joint development and integral operation of
the shipment and logistics centres.
Supporting services: a comprehensive set of supporting services - especially for the fi­
nancial industry - has developed relatively slowly. The environment for the develop­
ment of banking, security, insurance, finance, asset management, and consultancy
and information services, needs to be improved. Trade services, market operation,
exhibition and spot sale, information collecting and broadcasting, social supervi­
sion and talent exchange are currently weak. Supporting services such as these are
needed to create a more favourable business environment, and to support develop­
ment of shipment, warehouse and logistics activities.

Questions
1 What measures would you recommend to BNA management to enhance the devel­
opment of its logistics capabilities?
2 There are further concerns that government intervention finds hard to resolve. 'Lack
of coordination from within Tianjin and between Tianjin and other regions has result­
ed in duplicated developments and cut-throat competition in the Bohai Gulf Region
in general and in Tianjin in particular. The dependence on water diverted from the
Yangtze River Basin or from desalination is also challenging the sustainable develop­
ment of Tianjin' ('Tianjin Binhai New Area as China's next growth pole', www.eai.nus

ability concerns of the Chinese logistics centre model.

Summary
What are the benefits of integration in the supply chain?

• Integration in the supply chain is developed through improved coordina­
tion upstream and downstream. C oordination is concerned w ith establish­
ing the 'rules of the road', whereby material and inform ation flows work in
practice.
• Research has shown that improved coordination between marketing and lo­
gistics results in better performance in areas such as cycle times, inventories,
product availability and order-to-delivery lead times. Internal integration is the
essential precursor to external integration.
• Improved responsiveness from supply chains is facilitated by integrated
processes (including joint strategy determination) and synchronisation (coor­
dinated flow facilitated by transparency of information upstream and down­
stream).
• JIT2 aims to achieve inter-company collaboration manually by placing cus­
tomer and supplier together as supplier-in-plant.
• Benefits of electronic collaboration listed by Nestlé UK include improved avail­
ability of product to the consumer and hence more sales. The total service is
improved, total costs are reduced (including inventory, waste and resources),
and capacities can be reduced owing to the reductions in uncertainty achieved.
In addition, processes that span two or more companies become far more in­
tegrated and, hence, simple, standard, speedy and certain. Trading partners
become more committed to the shared plans and objectives.
• Electronic collaboration can be undertaken in three ways: transactional (the
transmission of fixed-format documents with predefined data and information
fields); information sharing (a one-way process of providing access to informa­
tion such as product description and pricing, sales information, inventory and
promotional calendars); and collaborative planning (electronic collaboration
at strategic, operational and tactical levels).




• The closest supply relationships exhibit both 'together' and 'separate' tensions.
Separation, especially during periods when the relationship is under pressure
as a result of logistics failures, demands continuous remedial work. Research in
the auto industry indicates that heavy downward cost pressures on suppliers
limit the progress at which relationships deepen.
What are the different types of relationship in the supply chain?

• Supply chain relationships can vary from arm's length at one extreme (character­
ised by a focus on price, and by few points of contact between the organisations
concerned), to vertical integration at the other (characterised by integration of
processes and by contacts at all levels).
• The choice of the appropriate relationship is helped by recognising that some
suppliers are more strategic than others. One way to segment the supplier base
is to use the purchase portfolio index, and to divide suppliers according to stra­
tegic, bottleneck, non-critical and leverage characteristics.
• Partnerships may create more value, and have been described using seven
factors: the sharing of information, trust and openness, coordination and
planning, mutual benefits and sharing of risks, a recognition of mutual
interdependence, shared goals, and compatibility of corporate philosophies.
• Three stages of the development of partnerships have been defined: cooperation,
coordination and collaboration. The move towards collaborative partnerships
is characterised by increases in the time horizon and the scope of activities
involved.
• Lambert (1996) established an enduring partnership model which determines
the appropriate level of partnering (collaboration) on the basis of an assess­
m ent of drivers and facilitators. So the extent to which the partnership can
deliver benefits drives the extent to which the partners should invest resource
in working collaboratively.
How can closer supply chain relationships be implemented?

• Supply base consolidation seeks to reduce the suppliers with whom an organi­
sation deals directly to a smaller num ber of strategic suppliers. Rationalisation
involves re-tiering the supply chain so that other suppliers are placed under a
lead supplier, or 'tier 1' supplier.
• Barriers to implementation of strategic partnerships include the inappropriate
use of power, self-interest, a focus on negative implications, opportunism, and
a preoccupation with price.
• Supplier associations bring suppliers to an OEM or tier 1 supplier together
for the purpose of coordination and development. They also aim to improve
the quality and frequency of communications between members. In practice,
association companies benchmark each other, and formulate improvement
projects aimed at increasing the competitiveness of the overall network.
• Keiretsu is the term used to describe the supplier association in Japan. Here, the
additional characteristics are that ownership and control of the network are


based on equity exchanges between members. Keiretsu structures have attracted
recent criticism because of their relative inflexibility and high capital cost.
• Districts are a distinctly Italian solution to competitive advantage that involve
the clustering of numerous SMEs in a focussed network with close geographic
distances between partners. Again, flexibility to respond to globalisation issues
is proving to be a challenge.
• Industrial areas have supported China's extraordinary economic growth over
the last 20-30 years. They have been developed by long-term, detailed gov­
ernm ent planning and financing. Binhai New Area exhibits many textbook
features - such as clustering of firms around the state-of-the art port and air­
port. There are challenges, too, including better third-party logistics, develop­
m ent of the shipment centre and supporting services.

Discussion questions
1 Consider the use of partnerships w ith customers to improve competitiveness. Discuss
this within a group scenario using the following guidelines:
a Make a list of companies in your chosen company's industry known to undertake
supplier development. This should include all its customers and other companies
that are potential customers,
b Make a list of all the types of development and improvement that your chosen
company would like help with,
c Assemble these lists along the two sides of a grid, following the example shown
in Figure 8.22. Mark on the grid where each of the companies is able to provide
the necessary help.

Companies th a t help suppliers

d Examine the grid you have constructed and identify the following:
• issues that require help that current customers provide;
• issues that require help that only potential customers provide;
• issues that require help that no one provides;
• customers (current or potential) that provide a great deal of help;
• customers (current or potential) that provide little or no help.
e Use these five criteria as the basis for identifying companies that should be valu­
able in ensuring your company's long-term success. These companies are the ones
that should be considered as likely partners,
f Having identified the likely partners, identify the difficulties in establishing partner­
ships and the problems in maintaining them,
g Conclude with the actions that you would undertake to overcome the problems
associated with partnerships in order to achieve their advantages.
2 'Supply chain relationships don't mean anything. At the end of the day, it depends
entirely on who has the most power. It's the big boys in the supply chain who decide
just how much of a relationship there's going to be.'
Discuss the implications of this statement.

Introduction
Supply management, enshrined in Kraljic's (1983) formative article 'Purchasing
must become supply management', is concerned with inbound logistics
(Figure 1.2), and addresses the broad task of coordinating the inbound flow of
materials - including supplier selection, risk management, and material plan­
ning and control. 'Procurement', or 'purchasing', focuses on the upstream part of
the supply chain, and on interfaces with suppliers in particular. One of Kraljic's
forward-looking comments was:
Few focal firms today can allow procurem ent to be m anaged in isolation from the
other elem ents o f their business systems. Greater integration, stronger cross-functional




relations and m ore top m anagem ent in volvem en t are all necessary. Every facet o f
the purchasing organisation, from system support to top m anagem ent style, w ill
u ltim ately need to adapt to these requirements.

Sourcing is concerned with the strategic decision of whether to obtain parts
or services internally (within the focal firm) or externally. If externally, then the
next decision is which supplier to source from. Reflecting the literature, we use
the terms 'supply management', 'procurement' and 'sourcing' interchangeably.
Procurement is essentially a functional domain of the supply chain, just like m an­
ufacturing or distribution. The operational focus of procurement is to ensure that
supplies of goods and services are in place so that a focal firm can produce its
product and/or service and ship it to the end-customer. Tactically, procurement
also contributes to basic value drivers - such as price competitiveness and service
levels. Strategically, procurement holds the potential to accelerate innovation,
and drive step changes in costs and performance levels. In recent years there
has been an increasing focus on procurement, which is being regarded as more
important and strategically relevant. Figure 9.1 shows how more than half of the
respondents to a 2011 survey indicate that modern-day economic dynamics and
circumstances raise procurement's importance and strategic visibility. Procure­
m ent provides an important perspective on the supply chain.

Figure 9.1

Changing perspectives of procurement

This change in perception can be explained by the parts and services that are
procured by a focal firm as a portion of total value add created. With outsourcing
and Far East sourcing dom inant in many supply chains, firms have become increas­
ingly dependent on suppliers for the customer value they generate. Procurement
professionals have become more of a critical group of supply chain agents whose
role is to create supplier value and align it with customer value creation. That is a
significant migration towards an increasingly strategic role for these professionals,
away from their traditional roots as order processors and/or price negotiators.


Key issues

This ch ap ter addresses fo u r key issues:

1 W hat does procurement do?: the strategic, tactical and operational roles of the

procurement function. Drivers of procurement value.
2 Key drivers of procurement effectiveness: business alignment, early involvement

of procurement, total costs, not just price.
3 M anaging the supply base: strategic, bottleneck, non-critical and leverage items.

The impact of sustainable supply chain management (SSCM). Preferred suppliers,
policies per segment, vendor rating - leading to 'customer of choice' status.
4 Procurement technology: understanding the technology implications for procurement.

9.1 W hat does procurement do?
Key issue: At all levels - strategic, tactical and operational - how does procure­

ment drive value?

If the purpose of the procurement process is to help ensure 'supply' in the 'supply
chain', how is that achieved? Essentially there are three key subprocesses to consider,
as shown in Figure 9.2. After specifying needs for supplies, there is a supply market
search for the supplies that are needed. This is followed by the selection of supplies and
the firms who make them. After this process, the suppliers have been contracted, but
they have not yet delivered the physical goods. For this, we have the operational process
in which supplies are ordered and received, and suppliers are paid for their services.

Figure 9.2

Procurement strategic sourcing, ordering cycle and managing supplier

relations




In Figure 9.2 procurement subprocesses are shown as interlinked circular pro­
cesses. On the right are the operational procurement activities that focus on plac­
ing orders, receiving goods and paying invoices. In order for these processes to run
smoothly, automation through ERP (Section 6.1) or e-procurement tools is often
valuable. But aligning procurement processes with suppliers can be even more
valuable, linking ordering systems on the 'buy' side with shipment systems on
the 'supply' side. Thus EDI helps to reduce errors, accelerate shipments and reduce
transaction costs. Managerial integration can create even greater benefits. This
type of integration takes time, effort and investment and, as a result, it cannot be
achieved with all suppliers. So focal firms contract with selected suppliers and agree
upon product and service catalogues (see 'contracting' in the middle of Figure 9.2)
so that - in the operational process - not every purchase needs to be treated as a
new one. Buyers can order from selected and pre-qualified suppliers so that they do
not have to find fresh sources and negotiate new commercial terms for every order.
Aligning contract and catalogue management effectively means that the left cog
in Figure 9.2 is needed - strategic sourcing. Suppliers are selected and contracted
for longer-term relationships in a particular area of spend. But, prior to that, the
company's need for procured products and services is assessed in depth, its current
spend with suppliers in each area of spend is assessed, the supplier market is studied,
and a strategy to meet business needs by means of a procurement strategy is devel­
oped. Typically, this strategy is developed by a team of buyers, but includes business
users and stakeholders such as manufacturing. Often, senior management is asked
to sponsor and sign off on strategies. In short, there is a lot that happens before pro­
curement action even begins, such as tendering for framework agreements. Devel­
opment of a strategy for a given category of spend might lead to the conclusion that
the category would be better made inhouse, and so should not be tendered at all.
The result of the strategic sourcing process typically is the appointment of suppli­
ers whose contracts are used in tactical procurement (production planning, project
sourcing, etc.) and operational procurement. Based upon tactical and operational
experiences with contracted suppliers, performance is often evaluated and rated.
Vendor ratings can then be used as the basis for supplier development and relation­
ship management - the third subprocesses (Section 9.2 onwards).
Figure 9.2 can be used to assess the maturity of a procurement function. If procure­
ment is mostly focused on 'procure and pay' and 'operational' activities, then its buy­
ers are more tactical in nature. If a focal firm allocates staff and time to activities more
to the left, it can be expected to see greater returns on its efforts and have the opportu­
nity to align procurement more deeply with strategies and drivers of customer value.
Figure 9.3 offers an indication of time allocation based upon industry bench­
marks for staff in different parts of the process. Staff mostly focused on the far right
operational procurement activities will allocate little time to strategic sourcing and
supplier relationship activities, whereas staff focused on the left should not be
allocating too much time on ordering, pricing orders and tracing shipments and
payments. If that is the case, it is likely that operational processes are not running
smoothly enough, leading to the escalation of many operational issues and/or staff
is not strategic enough in capability or positioning to deliver procurement value.
Table 9.1 offers a simplified description of what procurement departments in
different stages of maturity look like by describing relative focus on procurement
subprocesses.

9.2 Key drivers of procurement effectiveness
Key issues: W hat are the key drivers of procurement effectiveness? How can busi­
ness alignment, early involvement of procurement in product design and a total

cost approach drive effectiveness of procurement?

Depending upon the drivers of customer value and industry structure, procure­
m ent has different contributions to make towards a supply chain's competitive­
ness. The most well-known is to ensure cost-efficient supply of goods and services.
This driver is particularly valuable in:
• narrow margin industries;
• price-sensitive markets;
• focal firms that have a high procured value ratio, meaning that the value of pro­
cured goods and services is high in comparison to revenue generated. In such
environments a high share of total costs is managed in the procurement process.
Figure 9.4 shows an example of such an operating environment. A company
with €1.1 billion in revenues buys in €754 million. So, in this example, procured
goods and services am ount to almost 70 per cent of revenues. After investments,
other costs and salaries, the company makes a narrow 2.5 per cent or €28 million
in profit. If procurement is able to lower prices on all the procured goods and
services by only 5 per cent, it will more than double profits. This explains why,
especially in recessionary periods, more attention is paid to the cost reduction
potential that procurement holds, as shown in Figure 9.1.

Figure 9.4

'Waterfall' of revenue, purchasing spend and profit

But viewing procurement as essentially a function to drive down costs, ignores
its enormous strategic potential. As Cousins and Speekman (2003) say:
To view procurem ent as a cost savings activity o n ly is to senten ce one's com p any
to com p etitive failure. M any firms are o n ly n o w recognising that by leveraging the
expertise of their supply base, gains can be m ade that lead to a sustainable com p eti­
tive advantage.


Research of the Procurement Intelligence Unit, as shown in Figure 9.5, shows
that cost savings are the still the most commonly used measures of procurement
performance today.

Figure 9.5 KPIs used in 2010 by 200+ respondents to Procurement Intelligence
Unit survey

However, cost savings are not the only contribution that procurement can
make towards competitiveness of a supply chain. Ensuring reliable delivery of
supply helps ensure that production schedules are met and customer deliver­
ies are not at risk. Also, JIT delivery needs to be negotiated and implemented
with suppliers. In lean operating environments this reliability is of high value for
seamless process execution. In more agile environments (Section 7.2), respon­
siveness of the supply base is of particular value and, again, capable suppliers
need to be selected. Also, avoiding risks of discontinued supply and supplier
bankruptcies or supply interruptions are amongst the contributions that procure­
m ent can make to supply chain performance. Innovations and contributions to
step changes in services and service levels are achieved more easily through close
supplier relations.
It is for these reasons that it is commonly recommended that four operating
principles should be followed:
• Align procurement internally towards its broader strategic role within the focal
firm before turning to supplier relations.
• Involve procurement early and fully in supply chain design and development,
not just when a contract needs to be drawn up about prices for a supplier already
selected.




• Focus on total costs of ownership (see below) or customer value sought, not
solely on price.
• Do not consider the procurement job done when a supplier contract is signed;
this m om ent marks the start of the supplier relationship management work
(principle IV below) that arguably is harder than the initial sourcing and con­
tracting work, and more time- and resource-intensive.
If these four principles are met, procurement staff will be provided with the
incentive to allocate substantially more time to strategic and supplier relationship
management tasks. Such changes are not without their detractors. A common
view is that it is hard to show the savings for such broad-based and long-term
developments, whereas it is easy to show how much procurement has saved by
squeezing prices. And it is risky to become dependent on suppliers who may then
take advantage of the buyer's perceived weakness. But 'strategic supply implies
that supply chain wide skills, expertise and capabilities are brought to bear by the
full set of supply chain partners. They are united in the belief that by working
collaboratively they will accomplish goals that they could not otherwise have
achieved' (Cousins and Speckman, 2003).
Activity 9.1
Consider procurement contributions to managing the supply chain in three different sectors:
construction, consumer electronics and grocery retailing. Include in your consideration margins,
price versus service as drivers of customer value, and the ratio of procured value against revenues.

9.2.1

Operating principle I: Business alignment
The first operating principle touches upon the work that an organisation needs
to do internally, before it turns to the supply base. Given procurement's focus
on - and dom inant role in - supplying, these upfront steps often are ignored or
not focused on sufficiently. The downside of that is that procurement might be
sourcing supplies that are not fully right for business needs, running the risk of
focusing on the wrong supplies, wasting supplier time and credibility internally,
as well as company credibility in the supply market.
So, if procurement's role is to assure the inbound flow of materials, it is impor­
tant for procurement professionals to be aligned closely with their peers in the
supply chain. W ithout that it will be hard to know exactly what to buy and what
opportunities in the supply market are most valid for consideration. Achieving
this alignment takes consistent effort, much of it on the part of procurement
professionals themselves.
Often, however, procurement is governed as a staff department, implying a
degree of remoteness from supply chain operations. Even though, in principle,
any governance system can work, it does require talent to achieve that. Figure 9.6
shows how, according to McKinsey, talent-related factors help to explain the
majority of improvement in procurement performance (Reinecke et al., 2007).
Organisational structure is found at the very bottom of Figure 9.6. So, when



Figure 9.6 Weight of factors associated with 1-point increase in purchasing
performance score

procurement professionals ask for a better organisational position or a more cen­
tral role in the supply chain (and this happens frequently), this is a reflection of
weakness. Alignment needs to be achieved - whilst position is earned by means
of talent.
How is alignment achieved in procurement? It is achieved at a num ber of stages,
times and levels. Business plan alignment is achieved around the annual business
planning and review cycle at a senior level between business unit m anagement
and procurement leadership. Alignment around specific business objectives that
need to be addressed can be achieved through cross-functional operation of a
project team. Coordination around specific contracts can be regulated by order­
ing policies and authorisations that specify that orders over a certain value need
to be co-signed by procurement.

CASE STUDY

9.1

Johnson & Johnson procurement building blocks
Johnson & Johnson (J&J) is a $65+ billion health care company that employs more than
129,000 employees and 10,000+ suppliers around the world. The company's procure­
ment leadership has defined an ambition agenda of building blocks for procurement
excellence. This agenda does not only require structuring the procurement subprocess­
es from the previous section well ('how we manage processes', 'how we manage our
spend categories' and 'how we manage our suppliers') it also talks about risk, innova­
tion and talent/people management targets and focus areas. The latter will be explored
in later sections.
The key to J&J's agenda, however, is its operating rule for procurement: for, with and
through the business.
•

For the business refers to the fact that procurement should be a key enabler of busi­
ness objectives.




•

•

W ith the business refers to the fact that early engagement and close collaboration
with the business, as well as business sponsorship for procurement initiatives, is criti­
cal in the decision making, including shared governance of key supplier relationships.
Through the business refers to the fact that procurement professionals are distributed
through the company's wide-ranging business around the globe and, as a result,
procurement initiatives are run through these business (operation) units.

Alignment requires of professionals:
• The ability to identify potential levers for alignment and for spotting business
needs.
• A willingness to see functional expertise as a price of entry, not a differentiator,
as peers expect you to be knowledgeable about procurement - which is not a
likely subject of conversation: business needs are.
• A service focus to centre the effort on peer needs, not procurement desire to
drive value.
• A flexibility in articulating the agenda differently, depending upon business needs,
and creativity to find a way to stick to the agenda, despite different business needs.
• The ability to 'sell' ideas through participation rather than through the use of
authority or position (using these is a sign of reluctance to engage).
• To stand strong on business values, such as: 'customers first, positions last';
'improvement forever, complacency never'; 'value centricity, position focus ec­
centricity,' to help keep the discussion focused.
W ays to a ch iev e a lig n m e n t in clude:

• Embedding/stationing key procurement staff in the businesses to make them
part of the business 'fabric'.
• Using metrics of the business to evaluate performance.
• Studying business plans and business training material.
• Interviewing executives, getting invited to business meetings to understand
the agenda of priorities and issues.
Markers of aligned procurement organisations include:
• A strong business partner focus amongst staff.
• Incentives and performance indicators that are not solely financial - such as
cost savings based on PPV (purchase price variance - the 'standard cost' that
has been budgeted and then used as a measure of procurement's performance.
This ignores other performance measures such as those based on quality and
delivery reliability).
• Results that are not claimed by procurement, but procurement contributions
are referenced in business results (annual reports, for example).
• Procedures and authorisations that exist, but are hardly referenced, due to
seamless working relationships in which peers acknowledge each other's role
and have clarity about roles and responsibilities.


CASE S T U D Y

9.2

Business alignment at Cofely
Cofely, in the Netherlands, is an installation and technical services company with an­
nual revenues of €1.3 billion and some 7,000 staff. The firm is organised into 14 distinct
businesses w ith their own profit and loss accounts. These businesses serve either particu­
lar regions of the country or particular market segments. Specialised market segments
include the infrastructure business that focuses specifically on infrastructural works, in­
cluding traffic management and control systems, and the oil and gas business that
serves the oil industry at oil rigs and drilling locations.
Alignment at the highest level is achieved by the CEO's inclusion of procurement in
his so-called 'high five': the top five strategic priorities for the company. It is not strange
that, as a result, procurement is featured in the company's annual report management
letter and featured articles. The inclusion of procurement in the strategy is explained by
the strategy's focus on improving margins in a narrow margin industry and the com­
pany's high procurement ratio.
The strategic mandate is used by the procurement leadership team to engage in
business alignment efforts w ith the heads of the company's 14 business units. Account
plans are developed for each business unit based upon consultation of management
teams during the annual planning process. The account plan, similar to what sales
management would develop for external clients, contains (amongst other things):
•
•
•
•

business objectives that procurement can help meet;
projects and operational priorities that can help achieve these objectives and that
become joint priorities;
performance indicators to evaluate progress and results;
a review and evaluation set-up (frequency of review, participants, etc.) to ensure that
the account plan becomes a living document for collaboration during the business
plan execution.

Project teams tend to be cross-functional, involving business peers that have a key
interest in the project and getting the specs right.
These three levels of business alignment are hardwired into ordering policies and au­
thorisations that specify that large orders need to be co-signed by procurement.

9.2.2 Operating Principle II: Developing strategies for procurement
categories
Principle II calls for involvement of procurement early and fully, right across the
product lifecycle, from design through to disposal. This broad-based involvement
allows procurement to adopt a long-term, strategic role and to seek innovative
opportunities to leverage supplier market value. The focal firm can encourage in­
novation by reducing or eliminating three kinds of problems (Henke and Chun,
2010 ):
• conflicting objectives amongst the customer's functional areas through
alignment - principle I;




• excessive and often late engineering or specification changes;
• price-reduction pressures on suppliers that consider only the focal firm's finan­
cial needs.
W hen approaching the procurem ent of goods and services in a particular
category or area of the supplier market strategically, the focal firm can be
m uch smarter about how to approach the supplier market. Procurem ent al­
ready will be knowledgeable about supply m arket opportunities against busi­
ness needs, and will have benchm arked its approaches against com petition.
Developing strategic sourcing requires the following to be in place (Kocabasoglu
and Suresh, 2006):
• elevation of the procurement function from a traditional, transaction-processing
mode to a more strategic role;
• effective cross-functional coordination of procurement with other functions of
the firm (principle I again);
• information sharing with and development of key suppliers.
Strategic sourcing can be defined as a systematic process that 'begins with thor­
ough analysis of spend across a focal firm, and then organises that spend by
focusing on selected suppliers for best results on cost, new product development,
quality and service' (Smock, 2004). A procurement strategy typically is focused on
a category of products or services (category management is described in Section
6.3.1), and so is often referred to as a category strategy (for example, Monckza et
al., 2009). Categories could range from health and beauty in grocery, to surfacing
products in the construction sector. Chapter headings of a strategy document for
a procurement category typically include:
• Specification of supply chain stakeholders engaged in the development of the
strategy for the purpose of properly specifying business needs and aligning
business stakeholders.
• Overview of current procured value and existing supply base.
• Analysis of the supply market and supply market trends (what are the major
suppliers, what are their strategies, how interesting are we as a customer?).
• Competitor approaches and benchmark performance in the category.
• Consideration of the need to buy versus the opportunity to in-source; should
we procure at all and, if we do, how will suppliers connect into our supply
chain processes?
• Total cost of ownership considerations (see following section).
• Supply-facing strategic options and relevant performance indicators for this
category; taking in all of the above, how should we approach the supply base,
including relationship considerations? Do we want to negotiate or form a part­
nership, for example?
• Implementation and communication plans that focus on engaging the user
base in the business and along the supply chain during and after the procure­
m ent project.


The availability of strategies for procurement categories, rather than the more
limited procurement role in buying, is a key indicator of a focal firm's supply
chain maturity.

9.2.3 Operating Principle III: Total cost of ownership, not just price
Because savings are such a predom inant traditional focus of procurement, it is
understandable that negotiating lower prices is a captive dom ain for procure­
m ent professionals. W hilst price is an im portant aspect of the value exchange
with the supplier, it m ight be a limited focus (see segmented supply chain
strategy in section 2.5). Price is typically the order w inner in commoditised
markets, where products and services are easily exchangeable. But delivery
speed and reliability, product quality and innovation are more often the order
winners in other markets. So, when squeezing prices relentlessly, service levels
may drop in order to compensate for the price discounts. In Section 1.4, we
reviewed the trade-off between cost and time: more of one means less of the
other. It is for this reason that it is wiser to analyse total cost of ownership be­
fore negotiating price.
The total cost of ownership (TCO) concept acknowledges that price might only
be the tip of the iceberg of cost drivers. Figure 9.7 displays this graphically. For
example, price matters when buying a car. But so do maintenance costs, war­
ranty, durability of the car, how quickly you can take delivery, the running costs
(fuel, oil) and related costs (insurance, taxes). Beyond the initial purchase price
there are costs that occur over time, during the lifecycle of the product, such
as warranty. TCO is the equivalent to inbound logistics that cost-to-serve
(CTS, section 3.5.2) is to outbound logistics.

Figure 9.7

Total cost of ownership - initial purchase price might be only a fraction




The objective of TCO is to get below the price of a purchase, and to iden­
tify how m uch it costs a focal firm over the product lifecycle. This includes pre­
purchase costs, such as supplier evaluation and quality assurance (QA). Table 9.2
shows a TCO model for three suppliers of a com ponent to a focal firm in the
telecoms sector (Ellram and Siferd, 1998). Whilst supplier A appeared to be the
low-price supplier, it was highest on TCO once transportation and QA costs had
been added to the basic piece part price.

The TCO situation can change over time. Figure 9.8 compares costs of products
A and B: product A has a lower purchase price but higher maintenance costs. As
a result, over time product A is more expensive than product B. If the purchase
had been made with the intention to use the product for >5 years, it would be
advisable to purchase product B over product A.
Figure 9.9 compares costs of product C and D over time. Product C again has a
lower initial purchase price, but that price does not include shipping and packag­
ing. The price of product D does include shipping and packaging - making it a
cheaper product once at the factory (total delivered costs).

W hilst it may be difficult to quantify total costs fully, simply considering
total costs before buying provides an advantage in procurem ent. For example,
service terms could be m ore im portant th an price for a particular supply, and
the category strategy would show this. Alternatively, it could be th at tech n o ­
logical edge is more of a differentiator between competitors, so this should
be reflected in the search criteria for suppliers. Table 9.3 lists cost items for
different cost areas over the product life cycle, and Activity 9.2 invites you to
apply these.

Using the TCO checklist in Table 9.3, consider the purchase of: 1) a computer; and 2) a news­
paper. List which cost factors m ight be relevant in the respective purchases, and compare your
views for the two.

9.2.4 Operating Principle IV: Supplier relationship management
(SRM)
After the contract with suppliers has been signed for a particular category, the
work of procurement is not done - even though, traditionally, that is what might
have been thought. W hen a contract has been signed, it still needs to be imple­
mented. A lot of contracts that have been closed have never been implemented
fully due to lack of business support, lack of leadership with the new supplier(s),
or lack of alignment with business needs. So, again, without business alignment
and category strategies, contracting could be a wasted effort. But a contract sup­
plier that is not managed m ight be equally ineffective. W ithout im plementation
and supplier relationship management, many of the contracted benefits evapo­
rate before realising them during the contract's duration. So, if not managed past
contract agreement, the procurement process likely will generate limited value.
SRM aims for collaboration with suppliers so that a focal firm can 'develop new
products competitively and produce goods efficiently' (Park et al., 2010). The
basic steps to supplier relationship management are:
1 Reduce the supply base.
2 Segment the supply base.
3 Establish policies per supply market segment.
4 Implement vendor rating and improvement planning.
5 Assign executive ownership to most im portant suppliers to foster relationship
potential.
6 Manage towards customer of choice status.


Figure 9.10 proposes an integrative framework for SRM. The process of con­
tinuous improvement is facilitated by the alignment of commodity strategies,
supplier selection, and long-term supplier collaboration supported by assessment
and development (Park et al., 2010).

9.3 Managing the supply base
Key issues: How can you segment your suppliers into strategic, bottleneck, non-

critical and leverage items and w hat are the implications for preferred supplier
selection? How do you rate your vendors? W hat is the impact of sustainable sup­
ply chain managem ent (SSCM)?

Paradoxically, the first step to managing the supply base for value through rela­
tionships is to get rid of the majority of suppliers. The rationale for this action is
the inability of a focal firm to allocate development resources to suppliers when
there are simply too m any of them.
One of the steps to prepare for reduction of the supply base is to collect the list
across business units and operating entities, together with the am ount of annual
spend and which parts of the organisation are buying from which suppliers. This
information also proves valuable in strategic sourcing efforts because it is helpful
to have this information available in advance of developing a category strategy.
Based on this spend information, the opportunity to rationalise much of the sup­
ply base may be revealed. For example, it may reveal that different business units
within a focal firm are buying from the same suppliers under different contractual
terms, or that a num ber of different suppliers are used for non-critical items (see
next section) without anybody ever considering to contract a few with better
terms. It also tends to reveal that the majority of spend is concentrated with a
few suppliers, and that the remaining suppliers are high in number, low in spend.
The few suppliers with whom a lot of business is done are obvious candidates
for relationship management; others may not provide returns on the substantial
investments involved (Section 8.4).




CASE S T U D Y

9.3

Supplier rationalisation at Nuon
Nuon, a Dutch-based utility company, had about 12,000 suppliers, the total spend with
whom was about €1 billion. The procurement team analysed this supply base, and was
helped in this task because there was one single list of suppliers - which is not at all
always the case! In more internationally operating companies there are often as many
lists of suppliers as there are operating countries or subsidiaries. When studying the list
of suppliers, several issues emerged:
•

•
•

All suppliers essentially were treated in the same way: their invoices were paid in
strict sequence of arrival, they all operated under the same generic terms and condi­
tions, and no time was invested in any of these suppliers unless there were problems.
Part of the reason for this was that the list was simply too long for procurement
professionals to work other than in 'firefighting' mode.
The list was too long for procurement professionals to be familiar with, let alone
manage all suppliers effectively.
The list contained errors because it was not owned by procurement; there was a sup­
plier called IBM and a supplier called I.B.M. and a supplier called IBM the Netherlands.
What the procurement team did was:

1 Assign ownership of the supplier list to the management team, and appoint a 'point
person' in the operational procurement team to administer the list. This person peri­
odically sat down with procurement teams (which all had respective categories under
their control) during 'drive in' days.
2 During these days the procurement teams met w ith the supplier list manager con­
secutively to review their list and correct errors, relocate suppliers when in the wrong
category, and remove inactive suppliers or suppliers that did not fit within the cat­
egory strategy.
3 The supplier list manager also created 'speed bumps' (barriers) to introducing new
suppliers: new suppliers had to be submitted for inclusion and procurement m ight be
asked to underwrite their inclusion in the list.
It was found that simply assuming ownership over the list - a role not contested by
anybody - helped drive progress and awareness. Additionally, supplier rationalisation
targets were set, and the supplier count was placed on the management team's 'dash­
board' (Case study 3.6) in order to ensure managerial focus and scope being devoted
consistently to the supply base.
After clearing a lot of errors and 'clutter' from the supplier list, it was found that less
than 10 per cent of the suppliers generated more than 90 per cent of the spend. In
other words, there was a long 'tail' of suppliers (Activity 2.1) that had very little spend
and that were supplying only infrequently.
In order to reduce the supplier list further, the expenses policy was adjusted to elimi­
nate a substantial portion of the list where lunch places, restaurants and bars had been
asked to invoice rather than have the employee pre-pay and then claim. Also, a pur­
chasing card was introduced. This is a credit card in an employee's name but linked to
the firm's accounts. The introduction of this payment method allowed for a lot of small
purchases (for example, books, team outings and flowers) to be made by credit card w ithout the need to have the supplier on the list. Finally, the ongoing focus of the
organisation strategically to source categories of spend helped reduce the supply base.


For example, when contracts were developed for IT consultants, the list of IT consultants
was reduced from 200 to a manageable 16.
In just three years, these efforts helped to drive down the supplier list from 12,000 to
4,000 - making for a much more manageable supply base. Also, the structural focus on
the list helped track compliance w ith contracts (for example - are there suppliers on the
list that are not contracted? Are there old suppliers returning?) - simply because the list
was being managed actively and was down to a controllable size.

A fundamental factor in supply base rationalisation is 'which suppliers should
be selected for partnership?' Section 8.3 defines the characteristics of partnerships
in the supply chain. Selection criteria for partnership should be based on the
products involved and 'the supplier's competencies - particularly their capability
to contribute to new product development' (Goffin et al., 2006).

9.3.1

Segmenting the supply base
Not all suppliers are created equal. There are large and small suppliers by spend;
suppliers that do business with multiple parts of a focal firm; suppliers that have
been contracted through a strategic sourcing effort - and those that are not.
Therefore it is advisable to segment the supply base, just as we segment markets
and customers (Section 2.2). In the best case scenario, supplier segmentation
should align with market segmentation, based on the notion that supply chains
should be organised from the customer back, across the businesses and compa­
nies involved ('vertical integration').
Basic segmentation criteria tend to include:
• the am ount of spend with the supplier; and
• criticality of supplies for the smooth operation of the supply chain and for
delivery to the customer.

Activity 9.3
Supplier segmentation is the supplier-facing version of customer segmentation in a B2B market. So
a salesperson meeting with a procurement person is like two different parts of the business meeting
each other, creating a match or a mismatch. Consider the conversation between a salesperson visit­
ing a client considered to be a non-core 'cash cow' (customers who can be depended on for steady,
dependable cash flow with little opportunity for growth), whilst the procurement person is consid­
ering the customer in terms of forming a strategic relationship. Also consider the reverse situation.

A number of approaches seek to segment suppliers. The widely used purchase
portfolio matrix (Kraljic, 1983), one version of which is presented in Figure 9.11,
is based on the notion that a focal firm will seek to maximise purchasing power
when it can. This approach assumes that the key factors that affect the relationship
are the strength of the buying company in the buyer-supplier relationship, and
the number of suppliers able and willing to supply a product in the short term.





Figure 9.11

Purchase portfolio matrix

Strategic items

Strategic items are those for which the buyer has strength but there are few avail­
able suppliers. In this situation, procurement should use its power strategically to
draw suppliers into a relationship that ensures supply in the long term.
Bottleneck items

Where the buyer has little power and there are few alternatives, then these items
are termed bottlenecks. The aim of purchasing in this situation is to reduce depen­
dence on these items through diversification to find additional suppliers, seek
substitute products and work with design teams to ensure that bottleneck items
are avoided in new products where possible.
Non-critical items

With a good choice of suppliers, possibly through following a strategy of using
standardised parts, the traditional buying mechanism of competitive tendering
is most valid for non-critical items. Such items are the ones with the following
characteristics:
• they are not jointly developed;
• they are unbranded;
• they do not affect performance and safety in particular;
• they have required low investment in specific tools and equipment.
Leverage items

Where there are a large num ber of available suppliers and the buyer has high
spending power, then the buyer will be able to exercise this power to reduce


prices and push for preferential treatment. Naturally, care should be taken not to
antagonise suppliers just in case these favourable market conditions change. A
more tactical approach may be appropriate.
This approach to segmentation is heavily weighted towards the buyer's view­
point. It is also a little unfashionable because it uses the term 'power' in supplier
relationships, and assumes that traditional market-based negotiations will be
used for some product groups. However, it applies to many firms today, and re­
flects the tough approach taken by purchasing teams in some of their customers.
Accepting that these sorts of conditions are likely to prevail or even intensify, it is
clear that suppliers need to work on their relative strategic importance to a focal
firm in order to strengthen their position in a supply relationship. Indeed, this
may be happening already in the strategic quadrant, where the supplier tends to
dominate, according to a Dutch survey of procurement professionals (Marjolein
and Gelderman, 2007).
A major value of the Kraljic framework is th at it helps procurem ent profes­
sionals 'to move commodities and suppliers around specific segments in the
portfolio in such a way that the dependence on specific suppliers is reduced'
(Gelderman and van Weele, 2002). Thereby, it is possible for positions to be
changed within the matrix - either by suppliers or commodities. For example,
some bottleneck items (such as, m aintenance, repair and overhaul - MRO)
m ight be migrated into the leverage segment by simplifying the specification or making it more generic and so allowing pooling of dem and between dif­
ferent product groups. Figure 9.12 shows such possible migration routes from
'bottleneck' to 'leverage'. Such migrations and more strategic supply relation­
ships help in the im plem entation of target pricing, whereby m arketing in a focal
firm establishes the price of a product that will support the target market share.
Target price less margin leaves the target cost, which is then used to establish
prices for suppliers (as well as design and m anufacturing target costs). Target
pricing encourages more collaborative partnerships, and less adversarial rela­
tionships (Section 8.3). As Newman and McKeller (1995) state, 'cohesiveness is
an ingredient of target pricing'.

Figure 9.12

Migration of bottleneck items




Activity 9.4
Selecting a focal firm of your choice, use a copy of the purchase portfolio matrix (Figure 9.11)
and plot on it the names of its top 10 customers and top 10 suppliers. Which position would your
chosen focal firm prefer to be in? Suggest actions that would improve the situation.

But, in what may be a departure from the Kraljic framework, the impact of
sustainable supply chain management (SSCM) has apparently been to distort
the familiar relationships. By changing the axes of the matrix to risk to the triple
bottom line (TBL, Section 1.3.2) and risk to supply, Pagell et al. (2010) created
modified segments (Figure 9.13). 'Price' becomes subordinated to 'TBL risk', with
all three values - environmental, social and economic - at stake. Some segments
remained relatively unchanged - bottleneck and non-critical items are in the
same positions when TBL risk is low. In the strategic segment, risks have been
expanded to encompass all three TBL values. The biggest change was in leverage
items. In SSCM, focal firms are dividing leverage items into three subsegments:
• True commodities: retain the characteristics of the 'traditional' leverage items:
suppliers would have an impact on only a single value of the TBL.
• Strategic commodities: are recognised for their potential ability to be leveraged in
terms of their long-term competitive advantage. Instead of using buyer power,
small numbers of selected suppliers were being given long-term contracts and
premium prices to invest in new product development.
• Transitional commodities: initially these may be regarded as strategic commodi­
ties. But by working to reduce TBL risk, it may be possible to convert them over
time into true commodities.
The emphasis is less on price, more on supply-base continuity. Partners in SSCM
aim to work together in a m anner that 'allows them to thrive, invest, innovate
and grow' (Pagell et al., 2010).

Figure 9.13

The sustainable purchasing portfolio matrix


Preferred suppliers

Suppliers that win contracts as part of a strategic sourcing project tend to be consid­
ered as preferred suppliers. These are favoured over non-contracted suppliers, and with
the implementation of these contracts the suppliers get support and stewardship
from the customer. Often, their success is a target for a procurement professional,
and contract usage is measured as a key performance indicator. So these suppliers
are kept closer, and the relationship receives attention. But time and resources are
not committed by the customer to the extent allocated to strategic relationships.
Strategic relationships

A very small number of suppliers can become of strategic importance to the fun­
damental success of a focal firm, and to the performance of the supply chain. The
single most im portant characteristic of such relationships is that there can be
very few. Unfortunately, partnership-type terminology is one of the most inflated
business terms. The term is used often by sales personnel to try to establish an
appearance of commitment, whereas the real comm itm ent for these types of rela­
tionships is simply unaffordable and uneconomical to spread too thinly.

Dreaming up relationships or lining up grounded planes
Boeing's challenges with the market introduction of the Dreamliner plane are already
touched upon in Chapter 4. After its introduction, the Dreamliner ended up grounded
due to battery issues. Boeing was in need of changing its battery design and technol­
ogy. Despite the company's focus on supplier relationships, including Boeing Supplier
Awards (see www.boeingsuppliers.com), the management of supplier relationships
were pointed at as a main reason for its challenges.
In a March 2013 article entitled 'Relationship tests for Boeing - Questions over
the reliability of the Dreamliner jet has provided crucial lessons in managing supplier
relationships', procurement leaders report:
If the Dreamliner's birth was a painful [...] one, its infancy has proved that
there are lessons for Boeing to learn. The new aircraft [...] struggled under
its own ambition before the first deliveries came through years later than
initially projected. Now, oil leaks, fuel leaks, electrical problems, cracks in
cockpit windows and fires have forced airlines across the globe to ground
fleets and scramble for replacements [...] Some suppliers went to the press
to demonstrate unreasonable demands placed on them.
It was reported that, w ith the majority of the plane made by suppliers, changes and
rapid growth in volume of orders challenged the supply line and its financing, whilst
upfront and open communication about this was limited, introducing risks in the supply
chain.
The manufacturer is a crucible for how, with high pressure on production,
an expected zero product failure rate and a large outsourced supply base,
relationship management needs to be perfect or face creating risks.

9.3.2 Establishing policies per supplier segment
If suppliers are segmented as a reflection of how they are not all similar, the obvious
next step is to agree upon, and implement, policies that reflect the differing na­
ture of relationships with suppliers in different segments. These tend to be centred
around the amount of time and resources allocated to the relationship (for example,
from few in the commercial segment to many in the strategic segment) and the
degree to which the relationships are embedded and stewarded inside the company.
Typical policy considerations are shown in Figure 9.14. After this step, we move
from preparing for supplier relationship success by weeding out select relation­
ships and establishing the relationship framework. This helps to implement dif­
ferentiated levels of resource towards capturing relationship value. These efforts
are of increasing selectivity and commitment.

Supplier segments and policy considerations

SRM at Eaton
Eaton Corporation is a $16 billion diversified power management and technology manu­
facturer of over 400,000 products as diverse as pumps and valves, cylinders, connectors,
hoses and motors. The company has a programme under way to move from 700+ to
some 250 main suppliers of materials by consolidating spend w ith fewer suppliers, in
particular suppliers that can help achieve best total costs (see total cost of ownership in
Section 9.2.3), best service and quality. As a result, Eaton has recognised the need to focus
on strategic suppliers (see supplier segmentation in Section 9.3.1) and be an attractive
customer to those suppliers also (see Section 9.3.5 on customer of choice). Criteria used
for deciding which suppliers are strategic include:
•

they meet basic requirements of competitive pricing, quality and service standards
and customer satisfaction;


•
•
•

they meet extended requirements such as supporting flexibility, complexity reduc­
tion and business continuity (e.g. there is a basis for a long-term relationship);
they dedicate resources to the joint business relationship (people, process, technol­
ogy, capacity and investments);
they grant access to brainpower and innovations and align to Eaton's strategic goals.

In the context of its supplier relationship management efforts, Eaton defines its procure­
ment function to fundamentally be:
•
•
•

a relationship builder agent;
a change agent; and
a business process improvement agent.

Based upon this focus and these capabilities, Eaton hopes to be a long-term business
partner with strategic suppliers and focus not just on supply chain operations but also
on jointly improving supply performance over time a n d exploring innovation opportu­
nities suggested by suppliers, as illustrated in Figure 9.15. This effort shows how sup­
plier relationship management is, fundamentally, a two-way stream and, unlike strategic
sourcing processes, an ongoing effort with long-term benefits and targets.

Eaton's approach to collaborative supplier management

9.3.3 Vendor rating
Vendor rating is a measurement effort focused on supplier performance. Basic spot
checks on delivery reliability (correct quantities and times) are used typically for
commercial suppliers. Broader-based measures are needed for strategic and pre­
ferred relationships, as shown in Figure 9.14. Vendor rating is not 'measuring
for the sake of measuring': it is measuring for the sake of jointly improving both




supplier and customer processes. In the best cases, vendor rating results are used
as a basis for a standing discussion of joint improvement opportunities between a
supplier and customer team of stakeholders. Joint action plans are developed and
progress is evaluated, joint improvement projects and teams may be involved. The
supplier is asked explicitly to offer improvement suggestions to the customer, and
performance challenges are owned jointly, not just reported to the supplier with
a one-sided assignment to 'fix them '. In short, vendor rating is a mechanism to
develop and advance the relationship, and to centre relationship m anagement on
business-relevant improvement opportunities, structurally and consistently. The
vendor rating results are discussed on a regular basis, and use an agreed set of m et­
rics to provide structure and consistency in focus and commitment.
The steps involved in setting up a vendor rating system are:
1 Select the team: vendor rating is best undertaken by a cross-functional team of
stakeholders who have various interests in a given commodity from design
through to logistics. The process is not exclusive to the procurement function vendor rating works better when there are business peers of procurement pro­
fessionals involved in the dialogue to represent a broad internal client base.
Often, performance data are partially collected, based upon qualitative input
from users, and improvement suggestions should not come from procurement
alone. So, as in strategic sourcing, business engagement and alignment is im­
portant preparation for vendor rating effectiveness.
2 Establish the rating criteria: the actual set of metrics used is a tool, and there is
some sophistication that goes into its design. For example, the metrics catego­
ries may be consistent across categories but with different weighting between
the categories, depending upon the category strategy. Also, metrics should be
consistent between suppliers in the same category to allow for comparison
between suppliers. The metrics categories typically include price, delivery re­
liability and quality, with innovation and process improvement as possible
extras. Delivery tends to be reliability more than operational in nature: an on
time in full (OTIF) measure, for example, that can be extracted from the focal
firm's ERP system. Quality and innovation may be more subjective in nature.
3 Determine the effective weighting: this establishes the team's view of the relative
importance of each criterion. This may be achieved by asking members to u n ­
dertake a paired comparison of the criteria that have been defined in step 2.
4 Score each supplier's performance: team members are asked to rate the criteria for
each supplier. To minimise the risk of bias, a set of rating guidelines is established
for each criterion, and a scale agreed - for example, from 1 = poor to 10 = excellent.
An example of the output of a vendor rating for a supplier (Yayha and Kingsman, 1999) is shown in Figure 9.16.
Sharing performance feedback may occasionally be considered risky or as giving
up negotiation leverage when the supplier performance is good. That would be
true if negotiation leverage is all that matters, but in preferred supplier relation­
ships that is not at all the case. These are the relationships in which good perfor­
mance is celebrated and shared as a joint success. Essentially, the customer wants
the supplier to do well. Additionally, with a continuous improvement focus, no
performance is perfect, so there is always work to be done and the performance
bar is always rising. Figure 9.17 shows the output for three areas - price, quality

and delivery reliability. Whilst supplier A scores very positively on price, it shows
weaker performance on delivery reliability, prompting supplier and customer to
work on forecasting processes collaboratively.
Beyond vendor rating, there are advanced levels of business involvement in
supplier relationship management when it gets to more exclusive relationships,
as we explain next.

9.3.4 Executive ownership of supply relationships
The rationale behind executive ownership is th a t there is so m uch value to
be gained from select supplier relationships that it should not be left to pro­
curem ent alone to m anage them - and th at it is w orth the involvem ent of
senior executives from across business units th at use supplier services and
goods. Typically, companies will shortlist their most im portant suppliers and
invite senior executives of business units that are prom inent users of the
suppliers on the list to assume ownership of between one and three supplier
relationships.
The role of an executive owner of the relationship includes:
• hosting two or three top-to-top meetings with peers from the supplier to dis­
cuss the relationship and business opportunities;
• serving as a steward of the supplier inside the organisation;
• serving as an escalation point for usage and performance issues with the
supplier;
• serving as a sponsor of joint improvement projects and ensuring proper
resource allocation towards these projects.
Procurement may do most of the detailed work to support the executive owner,
but should not seek to take over the relationship. Rather, procurement should
seek to enable the relationship. If it is hard in a business to find executives who
are willing to take on ownership of a few supplier relationships, the value of
suppliers is not being properly recognised within the focal firm. In such cases,
procurement has some internal marketing to do. Alternatively, it may be that
executives already have suppliers that they regularly interact with, but on a more
informal basis. Here, procurement needs to infuse the systematic selection of the
shortlist and rigour into the way that relationships are managed. The value that
can be derived from this should provide the incentive. Finally, it may be that the
supplier predominantly will offer up salesforce resources to the exchange. In that
case there is work for procurement to do to ensure appropriate com m itm ent to
the relationship on the supplier side. W ithout it, the exchange eventually will
unravel and attention will shift away.
In addition to the very close 'one-on-one' engagem ent w ith select suppliers,
a lot of companies also use supplier awards and events to acknowledge and
award suppliers more publicly. These events can include a broader range of
preferred suppliers and be tied to vendor rating continuous im provem ent ef­
forts. They also serve as an effective channel for com m unication and supplier
engagement.

Acknowledgement of suppliers by P&G
P&G hosts an annual supplier appreciation event where it makes awards to its best
suppliers. As a sign of the importance and prominence associated with this event by
P&G, the 2009 event was published on the very front page of the company's website.
Suppliers of the year, such as Novozymes of Bagsvaerd in Denmark - a strategic enzyme
supplier for P&G's laundry and cleaning products - achieved this recognition by 'con­
sistently scoring the highest in broad-based qualitative and quantitative evaluations by
P&G employees throughout the supply chain'. The company's global head of procure­
ment said, during the event:
From market-changing innovation to supply chain excellence, our supplier
partners are foundational for building a stronger future. P&G is at its best
when we have fostered relationships with our external business partners that
enable collaboration in achieving mutual goals, addressing challenges, and
delivering ongoing innovation.
(Rick Hughes, VP Global Purchases, P&G)
But, perhaps more importantly - and as a sign of business ownership that could not
be more clear - the company CEO participated in the event and said:
I want to acknowledge the tremendous contributions and commitments that
our external business partners make to help us achieve our strategies and
goals.
(Bob McDonald, CEO, P&G)

9.3.5 Migrating towards customer of choice status
A final stage in im plem enting and rolling out supplier relationship m anage­
m ent is more of an aspirational stage that is not achieved by m any focal firms.
In this stage all the investment in preparing to focus on a select few suppli­
ers and the resource allocation geared towards selected suppliers, begins to pay
off at an advanced level of supplier privileges. Supplier relationship m anage­
m ent in m any respects is 'reverse m arketing' - it is the marketing of a focal firm
to its suppliers, seeking to acquire preferred status as a customer. Think back
to Activity 9.3 on segmentation: does this not have a lot to do with 'selling'
the supplier? Again, this goes well beyond the traditional approach of pro­
curement as the function that drives prices down through tough negotiations.
This has everything to do with unleashing the full power of business-aligned
procurement - with business engagement, ownership and involvement at
multiple levels, from category strategy development, through strategic sourcing,
through account planning and segmentation and strategic relationship own­
ership. The purpose of seeking customer of choice status is to acquire a level
of support from suppliers, not just in price points or shipm ent conditions but
wholly and fully that is preferred to competition. In search of this goal, supplier




relationship m anagem ent m ight pay off as a competitive differentiator. This
obviously requires an organisation's ability to achieve a status with its supplier,
making it worthy of such investment.
The recent recession seems to have driven US-owned auto manufacturers to­
wards this goal. Planning Perspectives carries out an annual survey of supplier
relations in the sector. CEO John Henke said:
If there was a silver lining to the recession for US suppliers, it has to be that it caused
the domestic automakers to wake up and realise how important their suppliers are
to their future fortunes.

Henke 'believes the US firms' improvement reflects the fact that many of their
suppliers went bankrupt or were nearly bankrupt to the extent that it threatened
the auto businesses. This led to companies working hard to be fair and m an­
age their suppliers more equitably, whilst continuing to consolidate their overall
number of suppliers' (Allen, 2010).
Customer o f choice status entails several benefits, including:
• First access to innovations and R&D.
• Customised solutions on a technology, process, service and product level hard­
wired into company supply chain processes.
• Best account management staff allocated to the account.
• Supplier wanting to do more than is needed.
• All senior executive ownership met with equal level engagement, both in senior­
ity, resource allocation, account m anagement support and time commitment.
The box below offers a set of tips and suggestions for supplier relationship
management.

Tips: For effective supplier relationship management

1 Supplier relationship management is a process, not a one-off activity.
2 We need to align internally before looking outward, but often look outside first.
3 Again, this is also not just about price: do not set all measures in a one-sided way but
have the discussion about which measures to use as a basic level engagement with
suppliers, ending up with joint and shared scorecards.
4 Procurement challenges suppliers but should steward them internally.
5 D on't try to do it on your own: the more sponsors and business interactions the bet­
ter (including for vendor rating).
6 If you do not know how suppliers are graded, the supplier might, as suppliers very
often conduct customer satisfaction surveys.
7 Measuring is less important than joint action planning; also share relative positions
of a supplier against its competition to drive up performance.
8 Any feedback conversation is an improvement opportunity to drive progress.


9.4 Procurement technology
Key issue: Understanding the technology implications for procurement.

As is the case with m any parts of the supply chain, there are several types of
technology dedicated to procurem ent (sub-)processes. In the late 1980s, during
the technology boom, there were a lot of portals and e-auction sites and tech­
nologies considered part of the big revolution. These technologies are, how ­
ever, mostly related to the operational ordering and buying part of the process.
Hence, one of the reasons for it going bust was that its value contribution
was limited mostly to ease of operational ordering and price reductions whilst
excluding more strategic dom ains and advanced value drivers of procurem ent
contribution.
Today, there are procurement technologies related to all processes, from e-auction
technology (including B2B versions of eBay) for ordering in commodity markets
to e-sourcing process support software that can facilitate a strategic sourcing pro­
cess. Catalogues (supplier generated or internally managed) and e-procurement
technologies are often used in the operational process or with the less-strategic
commodity buys where relationships are less important. Then there are linkages
into supply chain technology that are used in procurement, including ordering in
the ERP system or the use of EDI linkages to suppliers to accelerate paperless or­
dering, order confirmation and paying. Self-billing is often used by suppliers that
are hooked into the operational software of their customers; these suppliers can
bill just for orders generated in the ERP. Technology can help create ease of order­
ing and, in fact, this can be both a way to compel the business into using pre­
ferred suppliers and a way for procurement to create some basic-level customer
satisfaction (making the life of peers in the business easier). It should be noted,
however, that technology in procurement can make processes run more sm ooth­
ly and more efficiently but can never replace the value of top procurement talent
(see following sections).

9.5 Markers of boardroom value
If procurement is such a lever of supply chain performance and competitiveness
in more and more operating environments and companies, it is understandable
that there are markers of boardroom value that may be found in advanced organi­
sations. These markers include:
• Explicit m ention and coverage of procurement in the annual report, investors'
updates and CEO/CFO speeches. An increasing num ber of purchasing execu­
tives are finding their way to board-level appointments, as Hall (2010) says:
'Our study found a 41 per cent increase over the past year in the num ber of
European companies with procurement represented on the board. And last
year was up 32 per cent from the 2008 study. So, whilst we've frequently found
that US companies gave procurement far more recognition than European
counterparts, that simply isn't the case any more.'




• Published targets for procurement return in mergers, savings or supplier in­
novation targets.
• Procurement targets are m entioned explicitly in the budget letter to the busi­
nesses at the start of the budgeting season, preferably with an expectation of
paragraphs of the business plan to include procurement references.
• All businesses have stated plans, objectives and key performance indicators on
their dashboard (see Case study 3.6) that relate to procurement so that they
are managing towards clear business-centric and mission-critical procurement
(related) targets.
• Internal service awards are being won by procurement professionals as a sign of
recognition within the company of its service and valuable business contributions.
• A 'tour of duty' in procurement becomes a plus for general managers and heads
of business units, just like a 'tour of duty' in sales is - once this stage is reached
it is clear that, as a function, procurement has arrived and its impact in busi­
ness is acknowledged. Talent in procurement is not the sole property of the
function but becomes a company or supply chain asset. The nature of this tal­
ent is not unique to procurement either, as the next section will help clarify.

9.6 W hat does top procurement talent look like?
Obviously, talent needs vary by supply chain segment, and within the procure­
m ent segment it varies by subprocess. If savings are very important, then nego­
tiating skills are important, particularly in the operational buying process. For
strategic sourcing seeking to unleash contributions to supply chain competitive­
ness, a lot more skills are needed. Whereas, traditionally, negotiating skills are
emphasised in procurement, the list of skill requirements has grown long and far
beyond that. Skill requirements include:
• Strategic thinking: in order to approach supply markets more smartly and with
company strategic priorities in mind.
• Entrepreneurial focus: to be able to spot opportunities in the supply market
against end-market needs.
• Creativity and solution orientation: to be able to find ways around supply market
constraints and barriers.
• Communication skills: to engage internally and build bridges to suppliers.
• Quality and improvement focus: to continue to improve the performance of the
supply base over time.
• Relationship skills: not to 'wheel and deal' but to develop joint ongoing im­
provement focus with suppliers and grow those relationships over time.
• Stewardship skills: to represent suppliers internally and ensure they achieve
proper alignment with the business.
• Consultative skills: to engage with the business and ensure proper articulation
of business needs for suppliers to fulfil.


• Service posture: towards business partners who specify and order, and towards
suppliers who actually do the majority of the work. Whilst it is fine to report
results, procurement talent should not seek the spotlight over suppliers and its
internal customers.
In short, this profile is suited ideally to Master's graduates in the supply chain
domain. Often, procurement roles are much sought after, even if just for a few
years, due to the opportunity to make a clear and visible impact on large parts of
the business. Procurement results are clear and often targeted in investment up­
dates, merger and acquisition plans, budgets and business plans. So procurement
allows for demonstrable impact with senior exposure, which in turn makes it an
even more relevant milestone along the career path of future CEOs.

Summary
What is the role of procurement in logistics?

• Procurement is the upstream part of the supply chain that faces suppliers.
Given the am ount of value procured by most companies, procurement plays
a key role, not only in helping manage the company bottom line, but also in
ensuring critical suppliers, delivery service and product quality.
• Essentially, most companies and supply chains are critically dependent on sup­
plies and suppliers for customer service and performance. It is therefore recom­
mended that procurement is involved early and fully, so that strategies can be
developed per product category, strategies that appreciate total cost of owner­
ship, not just purchase price.
• Supplier relationships should be managed proactively with segments, perfor­
mance measurement and management, policies per segment, and executive
ownership for key relationships.
• The talent profile required for effectiveness in procurement is that of (future)
top leaders of the company.
• The ability to demonstrate high-level, concrete business impact within procure­
m ent makes it a function much sought out by aspiring and ambitious talent.
How can a procurement strategy be crafted and delivered?

• Procurement strategy begins with internal business alignment of procurement
with other business functions. It continues with developing strategies for pro­
curement categories. It is guided by total cost of ownership, rather than purchase
price variance (PPV) and it is facilitated by supplier relationship management.
• Supplier relationship management starts with rationalising the supply base. The
remaining supply base is then segmented. Strategic relationships are formed
with a small number of suppliers, and policies established for each supplier
segment. Supplier performance is established and monitored collaboratively
using vendor rating. The longer-term aim is to migrate towards 'customer of
choice' status.




Discussion questions
1 List 'before' and 'after' descriptions for procurement as a function and the profession­
als within that function when considering what procurement came from (staff order
processor negotiating discounts after supplier selection was made by others) and
how it is described in this chapter when it comes to:
a business alignment and business involvement;
b stage and degree of involvement of procurement in supply chain design and
strategy;
c amount of time devoted to strategy discussion;
d link between category strategy, supplier segmentation, and vendor rating, and
company and supply chain strategic priorities;
e calibre of staff in the function (defined as: potential to migrate to other parts of the
business, potentially make CEO one day and have a visible impact on company
and supply chain performance, both on a day-to-day basis as well as in terms of
progressing strategy).
Please also offer descriptions/examples of what these differences look like.

2 A recent CAPS report (Monckza and Petersen, 2009) listed 10 top issues relating to
the implementation of procurement strategy:
• Vision, Mission and the Strategic Plan
• Commodity and Supplier Strategy Process
• Strategic Cost Management
• Engagement by Corporate Executives and Business Unit Leaders
• Human Resource Development
• Procurement & Supply Organisation Structure & Governance
• Measurement & Evaluation
• Total Cost of Ownership
• Functional & Business Processes, Practices & Systems
• Structuring & Maintaining the Supply Base.
Explain how each of these issues contributes to a well-crafted procurement strategy.

Part Four
CHANGING THE FUTURE
The final part of this book takes a somewhat different approach. It takes the lessons
learned in the previous nine chapters and considers how future changes can be ex­
pected. The rationale fo r these changes is based on earlier lessons com bined w ith
current leading-edge thinking on logistics. Chapter 10 assesses current approaches
to the supply network, and th eir im pact on logistics in several areas such as internal
alignm ent, sustainability, humanitarian logistics, spotting opportunities fo r collabora­
tive developments, and the creation of supply chains and supply chain managers of
the future. We hope th a t this w ill provide inp ut to the process of taking the lessons
learned in this book off the page and p uttin g them into practice to create im prove­
ments in tom orrow 's supply chains.






CHAPTER 10

Logistics future challenges
and opportunities
The intended objectives of this chapter are to:
•

collect together major changes that are impacting on supply chain strate­
gies (the 'what');

•

identify how managem ent of the supply chains of the future will be af­
fected by the advance of new structures and approaches to aligning the
organisation, external partners and managem ent development;

•

list key issues in managing the transition towards future state supply
chains (the 'how').

By the end of this chapter, you should be able to understand:
•

key issues that will affect the way supply chains of the future will be
structured;

•

improved ways in which supply chains may compete in the marketplace;

•

ways of approaching implementation in major change areas.

Introduction
We are looking at an exciting future for logistics and the supply chain in general,
and the managers in it, in particular CEOs, are well aware of this. New requests
from the board for supply chain to help achieve pillars of future strategic suc­
cess and competitive differentiation are supercharging logistics and supply chain
managers - it is a good time to study this field.
Everything you have learned in the book so far offers you crucial basics to
travel on the journey towards supply chain m anagem ent becoming a key enabler
of a firm's competitive position. So the question becomes, what is it that we
will be working on in the next few years as we strive to deliver on the promise
of supply chain management? There is not one single answer to this question.
If one thing should be clear from the cases and examples offered in this book
so far, it is that there are multiple answers, depending upon markets, company
maturity and strategy. No two supply chains are alike, and companies often par­
ticipate in multiple supply chains. Furthermore, there are multiple scenarios and
initiative areas on which both practice and research should focus. There is, ac­
cordingly, plenty of scope for progress, both in terms of basics and in the more




innovative areas. The difference between 'satisfactory' focal firms and managers
and 'excellent' focal firms and managers will be in the degree of executing con­
cepts, such as those covered in this book, and im plementing them for real. In
this chapter we offer both key areas where work is to be done, even for the best
companies, as well as levers to develop for successful supply chain managers of
the future. So, in this chapter, we look both at the 'w hat' and the 'how ' of supply
chains of the future.

10.1 Changing economics?
Key issue: Supply chain integration assumes integration that does not come natu­
rally to firms and managers.

Supporting the concept of integrated logistics and supply chain managem ent is
the fundamental belief that, when functions, regions and companies are closely
aligned and work collaboratively, the customer will be served better. The reality,
of course, is that these are big assumptions that are very hard to achieve in prac­
tice. Focal firms still have to report their financial results and set their strategies.
Different functions in the supply chain have different priorities and internal chal­
lenges. Cultural differences between firms and countries still play a big role along
the supply chain (Case study 4.4 refers to some of these).
Economically, supply chain integration has m any benefits - for example,
lower inventories and faster response times. Im plem entation may be less about


changing economics and more about changing mindsets and behaviours.
Godsell and van Hoek (2009) list five com m on practices th at companies adopt
for the benefit of sales or financial reporting th at really hurt supply chain
efforts. They are:
1 Pulling forward sales to hit a revenue target, causing huge short-term surges
in demand and related possible inventory shortages, followed by a drop in
demand and inventory build.
2 Reporting on time in full measures against delivery dates promised by the
focal firm - not those requested by the customer. This creates the illusion of
'customer focus', while potentially being too late or too early from the actual
customer's point of view.
3 Having an inventory policy that is applied generally across the product range
to focus on the challenges of seasonal peaks and long lead times - when
demand for some products in the range can be more accurately forecast (for
example, T-shirts in Table 1.2).
4 M anipulating orders in favour of reporting ambitions - for example, stop­
ping inventory build towards the end of a reporting period to improve the
balance sheet, but ordering extra quantities after the period has ended.
Quarterly financial reporting requirements in the USA can encourage this
behaviour.
5 Manipulating sales forecasts so that they will add up to the numbers promised
by finance to the investor comm unity and result in poor ordering policies.
In short, the point is:
a Can we stop treating the supply chain like a concept or a philosophy and start
working towards its operational benefits in meeting end-customer needs?
b Can we stop using the supply chain as a playground for the strategically poor

who are seeking short-term gains from other functional angles?
It is likely that what will drive change is that CEOs and boards are ask­
ing more of supply chain and logistics teams towards the accomplishment of
enterprise objectives and strategies. According to a McKinsey survey (Gyorey,
Jochim, and Norton, 2010) CEOs are becoming more involved in helping the
supply chain team to set strategies and see them through. In a recent interview
(Ignatious, 2012) the CEO of Unilever talked about his plans to grow the com­
pany, and make it more innovative and sustainable. Against all of these strategic
agendas there are stated supply chain contributions expected. As a result, this is
an interesting time to study supply chain - the eye of the board and the business
is turning to supply chain.
The major change is not only the growing importance of sustainability, CSR
and innovation on the supply chain agenda (which the next two sections will
cover) but also the implications for supply chain managers and how to manage
change, which later sections will cover. Prior to all of that, it changes internal
alignment complexities, with the board now solidly on the stakeholder map for
supply chain alignment.




10.2 Internal alignment triad
Internal alignment between peer functions and supply chain disciplines has been
identified before as a prerequisite for success in logistics and supply chains (see
Section 8.1.1). And while growing C-suite sponsorship for supply chain contri­
butions to enterprise value creation is a certain positive factor for the future of
the discipline, it also means that supply chain professionals now need to align
horizontally with the business but also vertically with C-level executives. As a
result, in the future, internal alignment needs to be achieved in a triad
interrelation between supply chain, the business and the board.
Figure 10.1 shows a grid that categorises alignment between the supply chain
and the CEO/board. The top-right quadrant covers areas or initiatives where there
is clear alignment between the priorities of the CEO and those of the supply chain
function. These are the top priority areas where the supply chain has to deliver
results; cost savings are the clear example of a priority area in this quadrant. The
top-left corner includes areas where the supply chain would like to contribute
but the CEO does not perceive a major impact. In this area we m ight find talent
m anagement and supplier relationships management, where the supply chain
perceives it can make a difference, but has so far failed to make the case to the
CEO. These areas require a 'sell and tell' approach, as well as the use of pilot
projects, to demonstrate the value to the organisation.

Figure 10.1

Supply chain - CEO alignment matrix

The bottom-right quadrant includes areas that the CEO emphasises, but the sup­
ply chain fails to see their impact. Finally, the bottom-left corner refers to activities
where neither the CEO nor the supply chain functions place high importance.
Aligning priorities between supply chain and the CEO is only the first step in the
process of alignment, as, in order to deliver performance, aligning with the rest of
the business is just as important. To incorporate this into the model, we have split



Figure 10.2

Supply chain - CEO other functions alignment matrix

each of the quadrants into two halves, representing alignment (or misalignment)
between supply chain and their peers in the business, as can be seen in Figure 10.2.
The top-right corner is split into 'Bullseye' and 'Delivery Pitfalls'. Bullseye includes
those areas or initiatives where all three parties concur on their high priority and
agree they should be the main focus. Delivery pitfalls are areas or initiatives where
there is support from the CEO, but some business resistance exists. In these cases,
supply chain professionals can rely on their CEO to try to persuade business col­
leagues and align performance measures to gain their support, but they also need
to watch out that they do not commit to objectives set by the CEO too quickly, as
they might run into real resistance in implementation in the business.
The top-left quadrant is divided into 'Business-led' and 'Ivory tower risk'.
Business-led refers to those areas that both the supply chain and the organi­
sation prioritise, but that are not perceived as central to the CEO. Here supply
chain teams can collaborate with the rest of the organisation to make things work
and show results, letting the business sing praises to gain CEO approval. Ivory
towers are perceived as highly important for the supply chain, but neither the CEO
nor the business finds them important. In these cases, supply chain teams have
to be careful not to embark on pet projects and, if they decide to pursue these
initiatives, they should monitor closely performance and communicate results to
persuade other stakeholders.
The bottom right quadrant is divided into 'Will need to do' and 'Potential
bind'. W ill need to do are those areas or initiatives that the CEO and the business
consider important, but the supply chain does not. These are areas where supply
chain teams need to support but should not take a leading role and, if possible,
automate. Potential bind includes areas that the CEO prioritises, but neither the




business nor supply chain consider important. In these cases, there is a risk of
being caught between fires and procurement should try to work with other areas
of the business to make the case for a change in priorities from the CEO.
Finally, the bottom-left quadrant is divided into 'Challenge' and 'No-brainer'.
Challenges are those initiatives that the business wants to pursue, despite a lack
of support from the CEO and where the supply chain does not perceive value. In
these cases, the supply chain should try to persuade colleagues about the return
on investment or give them the opportunity to pursue their initiatives without
major input from supply chain teams. No-brainers are those initiatives that re­
ceive no support from the business and should be de-prioritised and, if possible,
abandoned.
In summary, alignment across business, functions and hierarchies has long
been acknowledged as an antecedent for supply chain performance. In this sec­
tion we expanded the thinking about internal alignment to a triadic perspective.
Given the supply chain's rise on the CEO's list of contributors to its strategic
agenda, this triadic perspective is becoming more relevant and can be expected to
continue to become so in the future. As a result, supply chain managers will need
to incorporate the framework introduced in their strategic planning and initiative
prioritisation efforts.

10.3 Corporate social responsibility: same trade-offs
Key issue: Sustainable and socially responsible organisations will need to leverage
supply chain capabilities.

There is a lot of talk these days about how sustainability means that focal firms
have to change their ways of thinking and the economics they use in making
decisions. Whilst we agree that sustainability needs to be factored into decision
making widely and generally as a consideration of importance (the Akzo Case
study 4.8 refers), we do not believe this challenges existing economic frame­
works such as the trade-off between lead time and transportation costs (for
example, Figure 4.7). This trade-off implies that shorter lead times create higher
transportation costs (for example, air freight), while lower transportation costs
(for example, container vessel) increase lead times. Increased fuel prices, or trans­
portation costs due to factoring in more environmental considerations and costs,
may lead to some longer lead times, but, while the curves in the trade-off model
may change, the framework still applies.
This scenario became a reality w hen fuel prices increased rapidly in advance of
the recent recessionary markets. Many firms were reconsidering global sourcing
and shifting sourcing back locally to save on transportation costs. Essentially, the
equilibrium of the trade-off between lead time and transportation costs shifted
with changes in fuel prices. But the framework was still valid. Also, w hen the
costs of capital increased with the credit crisis prior to the 2009/2010 recession,
inventory holding became more expensive and, as a result, companies were re­
considering centralised inventories. But the model of centralisation of inventory
to reduce inventory costs versus longer transportation routes remained valid. In
short, sustainability considerations might change the economic equilibrium but
the basic economic trade-offs are still the same (van Hoek and Johnson, 2010).


CASE S T U D Y

10.1

Sustainability at Heineken - beyond washing the green
bottle green
Heineken is involving its supply base actively to ensure compliance with CSR standards
and to increase sustainability throughout the supply chain. In 2005 the procurement
department did something many procurement departments do: developed a code of
conduct for suppliers to sign as an added annex of existing contracts. That effort initially
may have looked like that of many other companies, a bit of a paper exercise, but, a few
years later, the procurement team was able to really raise the effort with business and
board support for its intentions to make the supply chain more green.
On the back of that support the team improved and updated its code for re-release on
a much larger scale and as part of a multiple-step programme in 2010.
The code contains four areas (integrity and business practices, human rights, environ­
ment and communication) and over a dozen specific practices. The 2010 version also is
not just a statement of ways of working but comes with more 'teeth' in that suppliers are
asked to develop improvement efforts and programmes and are told that non-compliance
might lead to deselection as a Heineken supplier. Further to that, organisational commit­
ment is substantiated; buyers are not just sending out the code asking for it to be signed,
but also making it part of an ongoing dialogue. Sign-off within the Heineken organisation is
at the level of a local managing director for a local supplier and with the CPO and an ExCo
(executive committee) member for strategic suppliers. Finally, the fact that about 35,000
suppliers have been signed up shows that Heineken is engaged in the effort on a large scale.
The most interesting element of the effort m ight well be that, rather than a paperbased exercise, it is a multiple-step programme:
Step 1: Agree the code of conduct for suppliers.
Step 2: A supplier compliance risk analysis is conducted across the supply base. This is
a further step towards ensuring that the programme is not just about collecting pieces
of paper. And the small percentage of suppliers that are identified as at potential risk are
taking step 3.
Step 3: At this step, suppliers are asked to join the benchmarking and assessment service
of Ecovadis. This service includes a self-assessment of sustainability practices and offers
a benchmark against other Heineken and non-Heineken suppliers. The benefit of this
is the help in identifying improvement opportunities. Ecovadis also proactively drives
market intelligence through a newsfeed on members to Heineken (for example alerts on
pollution fines or labour unrest).
Step 4: This is the final step and involves a third-party audit for the smaller group of
suppliers that are considered high risk. The findings from this assessment are made avail­
able through AIM-progress and therefore hold the benefit of driving standardisation in
assessments and codes, as well as reducing the number of exercises that suppliers have
to go through, which is another step forward.
This case represents more than basic practice because the programme:
•
•
•
•
•

is not limited just to developing a code of conduct, having suppliers sign it and claim
that it makes the supply chain more sustainable;
is part of ongoing buyer conversation - this is not just a 'tick in the box' exercise;
is supported by the board and focused on engaging the business;
includes several levels of assessments so there are multiple tiers to it;
tries to standardise and share benchmarks and audits more broadly so that it reduces
the proliferation of standards and information requests from suppliers.




Testimony to the value of embedding sustainability efforts into supplier relationship
management efforts is a recent win where a major supplier did not think it would be
willing to sign up to child labour clauses until the Heineken team introduced ILO stan­
dards that help regulate this issue with local relevance. The supplier did not know about
these standards but was absolutely able to sign up to them. Again, this is due to joint
progress rather than sending a piece of paper around the supply chain.

Questions

Look up Heineken's code of conduct at www.heinekeninternational.com/content/
live//sustainability/Enablers/Heineken-Supplier-Code-Version-JvdM-05012012.pdf and
consider:
1 its applicability to other industries: food and non-food;
2 why the Heineken case goes beyond the NEC example from Chapter 4 (Table 4.8);
3 why standards like ILO and services such as AIM m ight lower the burden on suppliers,
bearing in mind that many companies have been introducing codes to their supply
base.

10.4 Humanitarian logistics
Key issue: Humanitarian logistics is required in response to humanitarian disasters,
but what logistics strategies are appropriate and at what stage of the relief effort?

In recent years there have been numerous natural disasters, resulting in humanitar­
ian crises. For example, the Haiti earthquake in 2010, which resulted in over 100,000
deaths and where the humanitarian logistics response was complex, and of limited
success, leading to long-term hum an suffering, as illustrated by Case study 10.2.
An effective logistical response to these disasters is vital in saving lives, but
before considering hum anitarian logistics strategies, we need to first consider its
definition. Van Wassenhove (2006, pp. 476) defines it as:
The process and systems involved in mobilizing people, resources, skills and
knowledge to help vulnerable people affected by disaster.

Humanitarian logistics is critical to saving lives but it is a huge challenge,
because it faces extreme conditions and a high level of uncertainty. Frequently,
there is little, or no, warning of the impending disaster, nor information about
the scale of it. So it is widely accepted that an agile logistics strategy (as fully
described in Chapter 7) is an appropriate response.
But, whilst the agile principles may be appropriate, it is necessary to appreciate
the important differences between hum anitarian and traditional supply chains.
Balcik and Beamon (2008) summarise some of the key differences:
• Unpredictability of demand location, time, type and dimension.
• Suddenness of large demand occurrence, short lead time and high variety of
goods to supply.


• Timeliness of delivery related to the effect on beneficiaries.
• Lack of resources (supply, people, technology, transport capacity and money).
One of the fundamental differences between traditional and humanitarian
logistics has been defined clearly by Van Wassenhove (2006, pp. 477):
Unlike th e private sector w here th e b ottom line [profit] m otivates th e con stan t need
to measure perform ance an d invest in im proving it, th e h u m an ita ria n sector oper­
ates w ith o u t th e m arket forces of d em and an d supply regulated th ro ugh price.

Indeed, an important distinction is that in humanitarian logistics the customer is
not clear. On the one hand, the 'donors' provide the funds and on the other hand
the 'beneficiaries' receive the service. Therefore, the business model is different.
Kovács and Spens (2009) review literature on the different phases of disaster
response and define three phases:
• Preparedness before the disaster.
• Immediate response after the disaster.
• Reconstruction, which happens over a longer period of time.

10.4.1 Preparedness phase
Preparedness is used to enable the immediate response to be more effective and

thus reduce the severity of the disaster outcome. This phase is crucial, as here
the physical network, IT systems and the bases for collaboration are developed
(Kovács and Spens, 2007). Network design is very important for shortening
response times, for instance, ‘Pre-positioning critical relief supplies in strategic loca­
tions around the world is a strategy recently implemented by some humanitarian
relief organizations to improve their capacities in delivering sufficient relief aid
within a relatively short timeframe' (Balcik and Beamon, 2008; pp. 102).
Another important aspect of preparedness is collaboration and coordina­
tion amongst all the actors involved in humanitarian emergencies, such as
donors, aid agencies, other non-government organisations (NGOs), governments,
military and logistics providers (for example Balcik et al., 2010). Tomasini and
Van Wassenhove (2009) identify two perspectives of coordination in hum anitar­
ian logistics: the former is geographic and differentiates between the international,
national and field levels, and the latter links different types of coordination to the
disaster life cycle, according to the objectives and stakeholders involved.

10.4.2 Immediate response phase
The immediate response phase has two consecutive objectives: the first one is to
activate the 'silent' network, or temporary networks, as defined by Jahre et al.
(2009). The linkages with feasible donors, suppliers, other NGOs, and so on, are
created in the preparedness phase but are activated only when the catastrophic
event happens. To do this, a contingency team is shaped, whose m ain aim is to
create proper channels of both information and material flow.




The second objective is to restore, in the shortest time possible, the basic ser­
vices and delivery of goods to reach the highest possible num ber of beneficiaries.
As Kovács and Spens (2007) mention, the immediate response links hum anitar­
ian demand, supply and fulfilment management, operating under a shortage of
resources and information. As highlighted by Van Wassenhove (2006, pp. 480),
'At the start, it is speed at any cost and the first 72 hours are crucial.'

10.4.3 Reconstruction phase
The reconstruction phase aims to address the problem from a long-term perspec­
tive. The effects of a disaster can be enduring and have dire consequences for
the population involved. Unfortunately, this phase is often neglected, due to the
shortage of funds (Kovács and Spens, 2007).
Cozzolino, et al. (2011) observe that the immediate response and reconstruction
phases require two different strategies, as shown in Figure 10.3.

Figure 10.3

Humanitarian logistics phases and the related strategies

(Source: Cozzolino et al. 2011)

On the one hand, the immediate response is about speed and flexibility having sufficient capacity and resources available quickly - while cost is not the
key priority. These requirements can be matched with the agile supply chain
strategy (as described in Chapter 7). The aim of the reconstruction phase is to
create a constant and efficient supply flow, where lower costs are required.
Clearly, this requires a lean supply chain, as described in Chapter 7. Dr Silvia Rossi
sums up the application of lean and agile strategies:
H um anitarian supply chains are know n to be quite inefficient com pared to co m ­
m ercial ones, largely due to th e exceptionally h igh levels of un predictab ility associ­
ated w ith them . This results in the concept of 'reasonable costs', rath e r th a n 'low est
costs', in th e im m ediate response phase. H igher efficiency an d effectiveness can be
achieved if the agile an d lean principles are applied to th e im m ediate response an d


reconstruction phases, respectively, leading to more lives saved, and the efficient
restoration of social and economic conditions in the long run.

Now we will consider the Haiti earthquake in Case study 10.2 and how the
three phases were of limited success, such that the population continues to suffer
the after effects of the earthquake three years on.

Humanitarian logistics response to the Haiti earthquake
Haiti was hit by a disastrous earthquake of 7.0 magnitude on 12 January 2010. It caused
more than 120,000 deaths, more than 300,000 injuries and more than 1.5 million people
to become homeless.
The country of Haiti (established in 1804) has always experienced political instabil­
ity, especially after the occupation of the US army in 1913. Since 1934, when the USA
withdrew their troops (albeit keeping the fiscal control until the late 1940s), democratic
elections have not guaranteed a stable government and the UN has interveened to
restore political continuity.
The economic conditions of Haiti are also poor, with around 72 per cent of the popula­
tion living on less than $2 a day. It's clear that the Haiti population was already enduring a
degree of poverty before the disaster, now let us consider the three phases of the disaster
response.

Preparedness phase
Due to its geographical position, Haiti has been affected by severe floods and hurri­
canes in the last few decades, the effects of which have been exacerbated by the poorly
governed urbanisation. Funds from donors have been substantial after the disasters,
although donors have always preferred to link their donations to specific projects rather
than capacity building. By the late 2000s, still 86 per cent of the urban population was
settled in slums, where the weak and unstable institutions have failed in creating and
sustaining an adequate public service - although, in 2001, a national plan for disaster
risk management was developed, followed by the raising of public awareness, an early
warning and evacuation system and training to reduce loss of life. However, the ongo­
ing political instability and the widespread poverty (as suggested by political indicators
in Figure 10.4) have reduced the effectiveness of such measures.

Im m ed ia te response phase
Within three days of the earthquake, $575 million was requested in the appeal - and
within one month all the funds were secured.
The UN's Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) was coordi­
nating 12 clusters made up of UN agencies and international NGOs to respond to
the emergency. Each cluster had a very high number of members due to the pres­
ence of hundreds of relief organisations. To aid the smooth running of the opera­
tion, subclusters were created. However, the many and varied organisations, most
of them w ith very lim ited knowledge of the country, tended to pursue their own
agendas.
The logistical response was hindered by the condition of the facilities:
•

Sea port: The port of the city was very badly damaged by the quake. The US Army

provided a number of carriers as floating airports, together w ith helicopters, for
relief operations. Supplies of food, medicines and troops were ferried to and from
the island. The carriers also served as hospitals.
•

Airport: despite the severe damage to the small airport, up to 100 flights per day

operated, but the airport had no warehouse facilities for storage of the delivered aid.
Further, disputes among different countries and agencies for landing priorities were
reported.
•

Roads: the road connecting Haiti to the Dominican Republic was crowded with Hai­
tians trying to leave the country and relief supplies entering the country. The average
driving time between Santo Domingo and Port au Prince (160 miles) was 18 hours,
due to the road conditions.

•

Airdrops: Since the ground was so devastated, landings were impossible, so the US

army airdropped thousands of ready-meals and water supplies to a secure patch of
land. It created riots among beneficiaries, as there was no control in the distribution.

Reconstruction phase
'Funding for aid work has been declining since 2010. UN agencies and their partners
appealed for US$382 million in 2011 but only received about 55 per cent of the
required funding. In 2012, they received about 45 per cent of the required funding
of $151 million. This year's appeal for $144 million, which has not received any fund­
ing yet, will focus on the most critical needs including supporting people affected by
the food crisis' (OCHA, 2013; www.unocha.org/top-stories/all-stories/haiti-three-yearsafter-earthquake).
Haiti was affected by hurricanes after the earthquake, w hich fu rthe r hindered
the reconstruction effort. The num ber of people living in camps and tem porary
shelters has decreased considerably from the peak of 1.5 m illion (as illustrated by
Figure 10.5). However, the living conditions are far from being back to how they
were before the earthquake.
The living conditions in the camps are violent and very difficult. It is said that foreign
relief officers brought cholera to the country and the disease is now widespread (as
shown in Figure 10.6) and continues to kill thousands of Haitians.

1 Discuss the key issues hindering the logistics efforts in both the response and recon­
struction phases.
2 How were the agile and lean principles applied?

10.5 Selecting collaborative opportunities to accelerate
time to market
Key issue: W here and how to place bets on collaborative opportunities upstream
and downstream in the supply chain.

Once a company has its internal organisation more aligned to supply chain
opportunities, priorities and initiatives, it is in a better position to select external
collaborative opportunities. In some respects, this is like placing bets - but not like
playing roulette, if managed carefully! There are new developments pertaining to
selecting opportunities downstream (with customers) and upstream (with sup­
pliers and partners). Specifically, the notion of being selective is key. Some argue
that the term 'partnership' is one of the most inflated terms in modern business
and it is well known that you can truly partner with only a few. So where should
we focus upstream and downstream in the supply chain for maximum benefit?

10.5.1 Selecting upstream collaboration opportunities
Beyond sourcing parts and services needed to make and deliver products and ser­
vice for customers, firms are looking increasingly at collaboration opportunities
in new product development and R&D. Of course companies can do this really
effectively only when they are aligned internally first (see Section 10.2 above).
Procter & Gamble has a stated objective to move towards having 50 per cent or
more of its innovation from external partners, and has launched a programme
called 'Connect + Develop' to enable this (see Figures 10.7 and 10.8).
The company has tackled this diligently:
• The programme has CEO-level support and public endorsement, making it
crystal clear that this is not just a supply chain initiative or playground but
that this is mission critical for the company.
• It has established a dedicated organisation with senior leadership, programme
management, deal makers, business developers and engineers.
• It has developed a 'needs list', containing technologies in which the
company is interested. This helps to focus the search for innovation, and serves
as a screening tool for assessing collaborative opportunities. Note also that this
means the company is publicly, and on record, sharing areas where it could use
help. This is completely counter to old procurement practices of playing divide
and rule with information.

innovation and application.

Y10.3 Unilever partner to win
Unilever has also become very focused on seeking upstream collaboration opportuni­
ties to support its ambition to double the size of the company whilst reducing its envi­
ronmental impact. For procurement and supply chain, this target meant it needed to
involve suppliers to accelerate time to market. Initially, a supplier summit was organised
to invite supplier suggestions.
Across about 60 top suppliers 100 ideas were suggested and 20 Unilever groups with
200 people participated in this exchange. This provided the launch point for a change
in supplier collaboration and engagement. By 2013 Unilever's chief supply chain officer
stated that 74 per cent of the innovation pipeline initiatives involved engagement of
a group of about 60 partnering suppliers. He also stressed that this requires different
approaches to the suppliers: less focus on aggregating spend and creating negotiations
leverage, more on openness and joint investing.

Most recently, P&G has also added a focus of leveraging the Connect + Develop
approach to supplier innovation potential into its supply chain design and
operations. This expands these collaborations beyond a time to market and new prod­
uct development focus into customer service efforts, downstream. This is interesting
because partnering with customers can be a much scarier notion than partnering
upstream. It implies sharing a lot of inside information with customers and talking
openly about what a company cannot do. Traditionally, this is not how companies
(and sales staff) sell. W hen making the mind-shift, however, there is a lot of potential
on the table. Specifically, some companies are initiating customer collaboration ef­
forts that involve working to resolve supply chain problems jointly with customers
to serve the end-consumer better. Amongst the areas where fruitful collaboration op­
portunities have been found are several process integration areas, including:
• linking supplier delivery to customer warehousing and materials handling processes;
• linking supplier to customer forecasting;
• linking customer ordering to supplier delivery planning systems.


Additionally, a focus on serving the end-consumer better implies collaborative
opportunities such as:
• supplier suggestions for campaigns and merchandising;
• joint product and packaging design;
• joint product mix development to improve inventory turns on the retailer's shelf.
An example of the latter would be for a consumer product company to
suggest replacing certain of its own products on a retailer's shelf with others, and
suggesting improved store and shelf planograms. Essentially, these collaborations
centre on a supplier actively (re-) designing part of the customer's operation and
adjusting its own systems accordingly. These efforts can come at an investment
premium and involve market risks. Hence, it is important to select wisely which
customer relationships to engage with in these collaborative efforts. One global
manufacturer uses a set of screens to evaluate customer relations in terms of col­
laboration opportunities. Counter to common wisdom, they do not look so much
at the size of the customer account but rather at the nature of the customer's
business and their relationship. The company may select smaller customers for
investment in collaboration because the customer could be, for example, one of
the rising stars in the industry worth investing in now, or it might be a particularly
innovative customer investment that could have a much broader spin-off. The
characteristics the company uses to evaluate customer relationships are not so
much financial or sales-orientated, but focus on 'soft' factors (see Section 1.3.3),
such as openness to innovative suggestions and willingness to experiment. The
company found that its efforts to evaluate customer relationships before offer­
ing up collaborative options helped in prioritising projects for greater returns and
greater opportunities for success.

Activity 10.1
1 What are the main risks involved in collaborating with customers? Consider industrial as well
as consumer sectors by referring to Table 2.1.
2 Why are internal stewardship and process ownership necessary for collaborations?

10.6 The supply chain manager of the future
Key issue: W h at are the changing needs and requirements that apply to the most

effective supply chain managers?

Ultimately, the purpose of this book is to support the development of effective
supply chain managers. This is, arguably, the most im portant job to begin with.
In that respect it should be noted that today's and tomorrow's supply chain




managers look very different from the supply chain staff of the recent past. There
are several key capabilities that will make or break supply chain managers of the
near future:
• These managers need to be effective at interfacing with customers. This is new
because, in the past, supply chain staff used to be almost completely internally
and operationally focused. Sales monopolised the customer, leaving supply
chain managers short of 'supply chain relevant' customer insight.
• Functional knowledge is a base requirement (this used to be a differentiator,
now it is a qualifier).
• They need to have strong interpersonal skills (van Hoek et al., 2002). Supply
chain staff used to be technical and operational in background and training.
They were heavily focused internally, without the ability to align peers around
efforts and priorities, and unable to engage business people in their efforts.
• They need to have general m anagement and strategic m anagement capabilities
and skills. Hence, they should no longer be solely operationally focused and
boxed in, which makes them unable to integrate and be seen as contributing
to corporate strategic goals.
• They need to be able to develop and foster relationships internally and exter­
nally (as opposed to being focused on only running an operation).
• They need to be able to translate supply chain efforts and jargon into business
language that their peers can respond to and relate to their own day-to-day efforts.
• They need to have a service ethic that does not include always saying 'yes'.
Traditionally, supply chain people have been very good at either saying 'no'
to special requests, or saying 'yes' all the time. They therefore need to m an­
age trade-offs in operations, while finding creative ways to serve the customer
and becoming an essential part of the business organisation (chain wrapped
around the heart) and being considered key business partners.
• They need to be 'business people' that help build and grow the business and use
the supply chain as a tool - not the purpose - in doing so. Creativity, innovative
approaches to business problems and entrepreneurial approaches to leveraging
supply chain capabilities and practices to the benefit of the customer are key.
This will help supply chain managers avoid traditional pitfalls such as:
• being unable to align the organisation around supply chain opportunities;
• lacking crucial voice o f the customer (VoC) insights to achieve success w ith
final customers (VoC processes aim to go beyond customer satisfaction m ea­
surem ent by crafting a more comprehensive, cross-functional exchange with
selected customers - for example, Delgado-Hernandez et al., 2007);
• being only operationally focused, with limited insight into strategic business
goals;
• taking initiatives in an effort to help peers, but not succeeding due to the
points listed above;
• being great at supply chain concepts, but weak at solving customer problems
and becoming a partner that is mission critical for the focal firm.



1 Consider what personal development courses are key for a supply chain student to follow, in
addition to supply chain programmes.
2 Find an example of a recent supply chain job advertisement at a management level, critique
it for competency requirements and propose how it m ight be modified to fit the future chal­
lenges in the area.

Finally, we have a few pointers for the supply chain managers of the future:
• Traditional logistics people are often seen as being best at saying 'no', often
because of initiative overload. Avoid saying 'no' for technical reasons, but ask
about the business need that a request serves.
• One way to select what initiatives to support is to avoid being caught out by
those without clear business and cross-functional involvement, ownership,
sponsorship and goal sharing.
• Do not rely on technology as a 'be all and end all'. Most of the tough
supply chain challenges can at best be supported by technology, but mostly they
involve people and processes - and m anagement of change skills.
• Traditional supply chain people often spend a lot of time taking calls about
problems, fighting fires and being the hero of the day. But this can distract from
working on structural solutions that will prevent those problem calls from hap­
pening to begin with. So stop fixing things and start solving problems.
• Traditional logistics people were born and raised in areas of functional expertise
and have built their careers around those skills. This leads to communication
and business alignment issues. Supply chain management is a cross-functional
job. So stop being a functional expert and start being a business general manager.
• Think growth, not just cost containment. The supply chain is often called on
first to deliver savings and operational synergies - most often in tough times
and during mergers. While the supply chain has a key role to play here, an
emphasis on cost containm ent underestimates the contribution of the supply
chain to growth, and keeps it in a negative box - insulated from the happy
times during periods of growth!
• Put the end-customer first - as ally and, ultimately, as judge.

10.7 Changing chains
Key issue: How do we actually make the transition to supply chain effectiveness

happen?

Based upon the experiences of having worked with and for many companies
and the detailed study of companies in different industries, countries, stages




of development and parts of the supply (details in van Hoek, et al., 2010), it
appears that there are some big lessons about changing supply chains that are
being learned today. Most textbooks and research on supply chains pay too
much attention to the technical aspects of management, leaving change manage­
m ent largely uncovered and unstudied. We have found that there are some clear
pointers in making change happen in a supply chain. Whilst this list is not
exhaustive, we intend it to be informative and useful.
Focal firms that make change happen in supply chains over and over again
experience the following:
1 Prepare for the (longer) run: major supply chain change efforts tend to take
longer than initially planned and longer than might be anticipated up front.
And there are typically no short cuts to true implementation of the plan
(no matter what consultants and vendors m ight say).
2 Plan to re-plan: most major supply chain change efforts end up being
executed differently than initially planned and the change programmes often
are revised along the way in order to be able to respond to changed circum­
stances or additional change issues found along the change journey.
3 A voyage o f discovery: there is real learning as you go along. As change
programmes evolve and progress, managers learn about new changes and
behavioural challenges - and how to incorporate them into the change
programme.
4 The boardroom pitch is only the start o f the test: after pitching successfully to
senior management and gaining their buy-in, middle managem ent and staff
across the organisation need to be engaged in the effort to give the programme
a chance for real implementation. Additionally, given the learning that needs
to happen along the way and the extended time period, real reconfiguration
and implementation changes require (senior) managem ent commitment,
which needs to be earned repeatedly. So, in short, boardroom support helps
launch the change but is not merely sufficient when it comes to making the
change actually happen.
5 Integrative but not integral: change programmes in supply chains often focus on
different parts of the supply chain. Whilst they all require integrative actions
to ensure business alignment and cross-functional peer support, they often
do not address the whole supply chain. Often it might be one part of the sup­
ply chain taking the lead - logistics or procurement, for example - and that
is fine: the supply chain is big and comprehensive enough for m any strides
forward, some even simultaneous.
6 Internal customers are a proxy for end-customers: customer service first is key
in all good supply chain efforts but not all parts of the supply chain have
direct access to the customer, let alone the end-customer. For those, often more
upstream, segments of the supply chain, internal customers might be fo­
cused on as a proxy for end-customers. Just like external integration requires
internal alignment as a basis, focusing on internal service is a good foundation for
external service capability: good service ethos also runs everywhere in your blood,
not just when in front of a customer.


7 Inside first: many supply chain reconfigurations start internally to the com­
pany before they impact other segments of the supply chain externally fol­
lowing the lessons on internal alignment.
8 IT integration: this was also a hot topic in the early 1990s but it appears to still be
hard to achieve and is not easily enabled but rather a source of a lot of work. It
is important to keep that in mind, and not to assume that technology makes it
easy to change broken processes. Technology cannot change broken processes
or poor alignment without the hard managerial change work to support it.
9 Benchmarks and best practices open eyes and help change programmes to stay on
track: external benchmarks are useful to set direction, make the case for change
and audit progress on the change journey using externally verifiable standards.
10 Cross-functionality: is key to engaging relevant stakeholders in the supply
chain, although not all functions and businesses need to engage. Rather than
full supply chain integration, the concept of selective integration is key and
specific to company and context. This also helps make change management
more focused and perhaps doable.
11 Consistent cross-functionality: is a key characteristic of supply chain reconfigu­
ration. Together with the complexity of the change process we suggest this is
a marker of effective supply chain change management.
12 Training and communication: these are well-known levers. Training staff and
m anagement are key enablers of change effectiveness and readiness. Com­
munications - to remind and reinforce across the organisation - are useful
tactics as long as they are updated with the change journey adjustments and
learnings during the change journey.
Kimberly-Clark Europe implemented segmented supply chain strategy, as
described in Case study 2.5 in Chapter 2. However, identifying the segments and
implementing tailored practices was not straightforward. Case study 10.4, below,
describes enablers to the organisational change required.

.4 Enablers to supply chain organisational change at
Kimberly-Clark (K-C) Europe
K-C Europe found that implementing segmented supply chain strategy was essentially an
organisational change that needed to be underpinned by all the good principles of project
and change management. They identified five specific enablers to the successful change:
1 O wned by the board: SC segmentation is an integral part of business strategy, and
ownership has to reside w ith the board. It must not be seen as a supply chain initia­
tive, but part of the broader business strategy.
2 One ow ner o f dem and an d supply planning: One of the biggest tensions that can ex­
ist within an organisation is between the commercial and supply chain teams. The
tension predominantly is fuelled over issues w ith balancing demand and supply,
given that failure to do so is costly to the business either in lost sales or excess and
potentially obsolete inventory. One way to resolve this tension is to create a single
planning function that is responsible for all demand and supply planning.




3 Clear benefits to the individuals: Employees on both the commercial and supply chain
side of businesses are notoriously overworked. The thought of any additional work
that a new initiative might bring is not very attractive. The reality is that segmentation
should reduce their workload. Make this benefit clear to them. For instance, 'How would
you feel if you had to forecast only 15 per cent of the SKUs?'A quantified statement of
how much easier it will make their job is a powerful selling tool.
4 Simple communication: Supply chain professionals can be fixated on technical solu­
tions and numbers. In terms of effective communication across the business this is
disastrous. The key to effective communication is to keep it simple. Create a com­
pelling story with relatively few words and numbers that employees across all func­
tions can relate to. Avoid technical words that may be pre-laden with meaning. Most
importantly, ensure that the benefits both to the business and the individual are clear.
A good test is to test your communication pack with a teenager. It needs to be simple
enough for them to understand.
5 Inhouse data analytics capability: Having some people (typically one-three) as part of
the planning team who are seriously good at maths and data analytics is a significant
enabler to the implementation and ongoing support of a segmented supply chain
strategy. It helps initially with the analysis to position the SKUs. It also provides a
resource to develop the tools that will enable SKUs to be tracked on an ongoing basis,
along with the decision support necessary to m onitor SKUs and ensure changes in
their segment are recognised and action taken by all across the business.

Question
1 Consider a supply chain change that you are familiar with and determine how each
of the five K-C enablers could be addressed.

10.8 A great function to be in
Key-issue: The future of supply chain has a lot to offer to the students of this book.

As a final section, we wanted to offer a reflection on how m uch the future of sup­
ply chain has to offer for aspiring talent. Just consider:
• a growing CEO and board interest;
• opportunities to impact international operations and flows, with m any ech­
elons and parties in the supply chain;
• a focus on topics of growing importance such as sustainability, innovation and
collaboration;
• an ability to touch many parts of the business and peer functions;
• a large change managem ent agenda that requires the development of general
managem ent skills and capabilities.
All in all, not a bad stop on a career journey for future business leaders and CEOs
and certainly a functional domain where an influx of new talent is very welcome!


Summary
W h a t does the supply chain o f the future look like?

• The chain is wrapped around the heart: the ability to align the organisation

internally, vertically and horizontally, around supply chain opportunities,
priorities and efforts in order to avoid partial, ineffective or failed supply chain
improvement efforts.
• Pulling the chain: working towards sustainable future and growing the impact
of supply chain on enterprise strategic efforts.
• Humanitarian supply chains that are able to harness agile approaches for the
response phase and lean approaches for the reconstructive phase.
• Hooked on the chain: the capability to spot and select the limited number of
collaborative opportunities upstream with partners and suppliers, and down­
stream with customers.
• Critical link in the chain: the development of a 'new breed' of supply chain m an­
agers that will help realise all of the above.
• Changing chains: the capability to make the change actually happen for real.
We hope the readers of this book will have picked up insights and lessons
that they can use on their journey to create supply chains of the future. In our
experience of working for many different companies in different industries and
countries, and based upon our research from across the past decade, we are con­
vinced about one thing: most of the progress in supply chain management is still
'up for grabs'. Both at the basic and more advanced levels, most focal firms still
have only started on the journey of opportunity and possibility. Actually making
the change happen will be the characteristic that sets leaders apart in our field.
We wish readers the best in making change happen, and in working for a better
supply chain of the future.

Discussion questions
1 We started out in Chapter 1 by defining supply chain management as 'Planning and
controlling all of the business processes that link together partners in a supply chain
in order to serve the needs of the end-customer'. How will leading-edge develop­
ments covered in this chapter contribute to this vision?

2 Suggest how the change areas discussed in this chapter apply to our model of the
supply network (Figure 1.2) and to the integration of demand and supply shown in
Figure 1.7.
