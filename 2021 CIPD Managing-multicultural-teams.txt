Introduction

The multicultural team is a phenomenon that, in particular due to globalisation, migration
and greater workforce diversity, has seen long-term growth. Understanding cultural
differences should be a prominent consideration for contemporary people managers.
Exploring the evidence around managing culturally diverse teams is vital, as poor
management can have negative outcomes, as discussed in the CIPD’s evidence-based
report Diversity Management that Works.
The COVID-19 pandemic has prompted many organisations to radically change their
ways of working or even overhaul their business models. As a result, the spotlight now
shines even brighter on managers, who play a pivotal role in helping organisations adapt
and thrive. One major area of change is homeworking: having steadily become more
commonplace over the last two decades, it has seen a huge increase due to the pandemic
and may continue to increase in the future. This presents particular challenges for the
management of multicultural teams and, what’s more, may make them more common.
As our economies start to recover from the effects of the pandemic, it’s vital that
organisations know how to manage multicultural teams effectively.
The challenges posed by multicultural teams
Cultural diversity is reflected in the different values, ways of thinking, and behavioural
patterns of team members.1 Research2 suggests that organisations working with
multicultural teams face a threefold challenge:
• creating a common goal
• enabling each team member to work at their best
• ensuring fair treatment for all, irrespective of background.
Exactly how to approach these challenges and create a supportive and high-performing
team is a difficult question, but it’s generally agreed that overcoming barriers inherent to
cultural differences – for example, problems of communication and different values – will
allow multicultural teams to reap the rewards of innovation and learning, among other
positive outcomes.3
Overcoming the barriers needed to unlock the potential of multicultural teams can be
challenging, but it can also bring something new and unique to work groups.4 We view
cultural diversity, like diversity more generally, as a positive that can facilitate many
beneficial outcomes for businesses, so long as they provide inclusive environments and
careful management of their people.
A developing and relevant research area
While plenty of research in the 2000s explored the link between cultural diversity and
team performance, some5 found positive associations, while others6 suggested a negative
link. One early meta-analysis7 of research on group member heterogeneity concluded that
‘much is still unknown regarding the nature of diversity, its impact on work group outcomes,
and the intervening mechanisms’ (p142).
At the time, more needed to be done to provide clarity on the mechanisms of the
relationship between culturally diverse teams and organisational outcomes. The consensus
was clear: to shine a light on the mixed effects of culturally diverse teams, the key
influences needed to be explored.8 Research in the past decade has indeed sought to do
this, exploring the effects of factors like creativity, communication and cultural intelligence
on the relationship between multicultural teams and work outcomes.

The global COVID-19 pandemic – and the resulting changes to our organisations and
workforces – has brought into focus the role of managers in supporting and developing
successful virtual teams. This is no different in multicultural teams, where managers seek
to contend with a number of challenges that are both heightened by working remotely
and unique to teams whose members are culturally diverse. Naturally, this feels like an
appropriate time to explore these issues in detail.

Aims and approach of the research

In this research, we set out to explore the opportunities and challenges faced by
multicultural teams, with a particular focus on the role managers can play in overcoming
the barriers to working effectively and unlocking their potential.
Exploring the research evidence
We first assessed the research literature on multicultural teams, exploring how multicultural
teams are defined and identifying their benefits and challenges – looking specifically
at creativity, communication and geographical dispersion, and how they mediate the
relationship between cultural diversity and team outcomes. The notion of cultural
intelligence, or cross-cultural competence, was then explored as we considered how it can
be developed to embrace multicultural teams and facilitate their success.
Engaging with managers of multicultural teams
We also conducted online focus groups with managers from three different global regions
to assess their perspectives on managing multicultural teams. We aimed to:
• explore the perspectives of 23 managers on multicultural teams
• identify the key challenges and opportunities in multicultural teams
• gain insight into the skills, capabilities and guidance people need to work effectively in a
multicultural environment
• understand the perceived impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on teamworking in this context.
Research took place in May 2020 in the UK, APAC (Asia-Pacific) and the Middle East (ME). UK
participants were recruited via the YouGov Panel, and APAC and ME participants were recruited
via the CIPD.

Aims and approach of the research

Managing multicultural teams: Exploring the opportunities and challenges

Bringing together this practitioner expertise with a review of the scientific literature, we draw
on two crucial sources of evidence, in line with the principles of evidence-based practice:9

• practitioner expertise
• scientific literature.
This research aims to help people professionals understand the nature of multicultural
teams, the challenges they face, and how to approach these challenges and harness the
benefits of diverse teams. It provides key recommendations on the influencing factors
that must be addressed to balance and manage the various values, experiences and
personalities in your teams.
The following section explores the findings of this dual approach thematically, first
outlining what the evidence tells us about each theme, followed by investigating manager
perspectives from our focus group participants.

What are multicultural teams?

Section summary
• Research evidence and manager insights frame multicultural teams as those
whose members share a variety of values and attitudes – not only as a result of
demographics, but of their experiences too.
• Evidence suggests cultural diversity affects multicultural teams in three differing
ways, which we outline below.
• Managers highlight sensitivity and empathy as key to creating a trusting and
supportive environment for culturally diverse staff.

Evidence base
Multicultural teams are generally defined as a group of people from different nationalities
and cultures whose shared goal is to deliver for an organisation or another stakeholder.10
Evident in these teams is that its members have spent a significant portion of their formative
years in different countries and have consequently learned different values and demeanours
– aspects that we know make up generally agreed definitions of organisational culture, or
‘the way we do things around here’.11
Being part of a culture provides a source of identity for its members.12 Diversity of culture in
organisational teams is therefore thought to influence them in three potentially opposing ways:13
1 First, people are attracted to working alongside those they find similar to themselves in
terms of values, beliefs and attitudes.14
2 Second, people categorise themselves into groups and categorise others as outsiders or
as members of other groups.15 This leads to favouritism towards those belonging to the
group and stereotyping of others.
3 A third perspective positions cultural diversity as an opportunity rather than a problem,
suggesting that it helps bring more varied contributions to teams, enabling new
information and perspectives to be heard and subsequently enhancing the team’s
problem-solving and creativity.16

Respondents felt the UK is a
multicultural society, but less
so than the other regions.

Being part of a
multicultural team is the
norm in the ME region.

Respondents felt pride
at living in a region that
encourages multiculturalism.

Our focus group participants generally had a clear sense of what they understood to be
a multicultural team. They highlighted the mixing of people from different nationalities,
ethnicities and religions, as well as those of varying ages and genders. Many felt that
multiculturalism goes beyond demographics; there was discussion around the different
values, perspectives and experiences people bring to a team; for example, those who work
in different industries.

We have a very diverse group with more than 60 nationalities
and very different perspectives… [It’s a] challenge for some to
work with, but others who are open to listen, engage and be
challenged work well. (focus group member, ME)
Respondents from APAC and ME countries were particularly aware of multiculturalism in
their teams, especially those from multinational firms, where expatriate employees are
the norm. This is something they consider when managing their teams. One participant,
for example, described adjusting their management style as ‘lifelong learning. [You] try
to adjust to some degree, yet also expect the other team members to come forward and
be more open minded, so my team works off the premise “assume good intent first”’
(focus group member, APAC).
Participants highlighted open-mindedness and cultural sensitivity as two key aspects
of their roles. While they noted that the skills needed to manage a multicultural team
are similar to those of any good manager, showing sensitivity to cultural issues through
empathy, attempting to find common ground, and being a good listener are vital to
creating trust and fostering a supportive environment among culturally diverse teams.

	What are the benefits and
challenges of multicultural teams?

Section summary
• Research on the key factors influencing the relationship between cultural diversity
and positive outcomes (notably creativity and communication) has boomed in the
last decade.
• Multicultural teams are more creative than homogenous teams, especially those
with deep-level diversity (in other words, more diverse attitudes and values
towards culture).
• Managers particularly acknowledge the benefits of sharing unique perspectives
and experiences – not just for innovating at work but for team members to
become more well rounded.
• Language barriers present a challenge to effective communication. They reduce
colleagues’ levels of trust and expectations of successful work, and sometimes
lead to ‘code-switching’ – switching to one’s native language.
• Leaders are important to combat these barriers through upholding language
discipline and highlighting the achievements of staff beyond their language skills.
• Showing patience and sensitivity to culturally specific nuances of language is a
key skill for managers to better understand their team’s behaviour.
• An environment home to diverse, different, unique contributions is more important
than one boasting perfect communicators.

Evidence base
In 2010, Stahl et al17 conducted a meta-analysis of exploring the link between diversity
of culture and organisational outcomes. They found cultural diversity to be unrelated to
overall team performance. However, cultural diversity was found to be associated with
other divergent and somewhat contradictory team outcomes. While more culturally diverse
teams were found to experience increased creativity, they suffered from greater conflict –
particularly task conflict, and, to a lesser extent, relationship and process conflict.
Interestingly, while these teams experienced lower social integration and cohesion,
contrary to expectations, the effectiveness of their communication was not reduced,
and they were found to be more satisfied than homogenous teams. It should be noted
that the effect sizes for these relationships were generally small.18 By ‘small’ we mean
that the difference is not big enough to observe in day-to-day activity and would need
to be measured to be detected. In short, the relationship between cultural diversity and
organisational outcomes exists, but is weak.
The researchers’ main recommendation from this 2010 paper was that future research
should move beyond the simple question of the positive or negative effect cultural
diversity has on team performance, and focus more on the mechanisms by which
teams are affected by cultural diversity, and the intervening processes that influence
this relationship. This year (2021), the authors of the original research paper took a
retrospective look at their study and where the body of evidence has developed in the
past decade.19 First of all, they focused on creativity and communication.

Culturally diverse teams are more creative
Creativity is a very important immediate team outcome for several reasons. First, in Stahl
et al (2010),20 the positive relationship between culturally diverse teams and greater
creativity was found to be the strongest of all outcome variables measured. Second,
creativity is part of the process of innovating for new ideas and solutions – in fact, the two
are often measured interchangeably. Third, research on the relationship between cultural
diversity and team creativity has flourished in the last decade, as summarised by a recent
meta-analysis from Wang et al (2019).21 This body of research identifies three levels to
culture – team, organisational and national22 – though Wang focuses on national culture,
which is based on countries and ethnicities. This is because many countries these days
have several different ethnic cultures, and many ethnic cultures exist across more than one
country.23 As mentioned earlier, the shared elements of spending time in a certain country
or among a certain group, such as language, etiquette and geographic location, can
influence the perceptions, values and actions of people in such groups.24
Wang et al (2019) sought to heed the wishes of Stahl et al (2010) in finding more
nuance in the relationship between multicultural teams and organisational outcomes by
distinguishing between surface-level and deep-level diversity in multicultural teams. Put
simply, surface-level diversity is defined as overt demographic differences between team
members. For cultural diversity, ethnicity and nationality are most commonly examined
in team research.25 Deep-level diversity concerns less immediately observable, more
psychological characteristics – notably, the values and attitudes associated with culture.26
Wang et al (2019) found deep-level diversity to be associated with greater team creativity,
given that this enables a greater range of knowledge and perspectives and generates novel
ideas.27 This effect was more positive when teams worked face-to-face and members had
to rely on each other for input and resources. Surface-level diversity, on the other hand –
more associated with threats to identity and intergroup conflict – was found to have no
association with creativity and innovation. This was unexpected, as a negative relationship
was predicted. A negative relationship was present, however, when tasks were simple.
Multicultural teams’ communication is affected by language barriers
As with creativity, research on communication in multicultural teams has not only become
more prevalent but more nuanced in recent years, particularly as a result of a long-overdue
increase in the role of language differences in how teams communicate.
One particularly influential study28 investigated the ways in which multinational team
members’ reactions to language barriers influence their intention to trust and subsequent
trust formation. They first found that members who don’t speak the team’s shared language
well are often not recognised for their high technical skills, instead being perceived as lacking
ability. These negative attributions influence judgements on their trustworthiness. It was
found to be important that a colleague can fulfil their share of a group task; lacking shared
language proficiency, and in turn appearing to lack competence, jeopardises this.
Simple linguistic misunderstandings which lead to unmet expectations could also
misinform employees’ judgements about their colleagues’ dependability, to the point
where they are perceived as unreliable or even untrue to their word. Again, this
dependability (or lack thereof) influences the relationship between language barriers and
judgements on trustworthiness. Put simply, if a colleague misunderstands your instructions,
and subsequently fails to complete these, they may be perceived as less dependable and,
as a result, less trustworthy.

How do employees respond to language barriers?
One prominent reaction to language barriers is switching from the shared team language
to one’s own mother tongue, also known as ‘code-switching’.29 There is evidence that
this occurs in all teams, irrespective of size and function. Some perceive this as simply
a method of ensuring effective communication by allowing team members with lower
proficiency in the shared language a chance to speak in their native tongue, but others
feel it is more emotionally driven, occurring more when stress and emotion are greater.
Switches in language are reported to be short-lived if only a few team members speak the
particular language, but more extensive when more colleagues do. Often, strong negative
emotions are reported towards code-switching, including feelings of exclusion, discomfort
and even suspicion and paranoia.
Another study30 highlights emotion-regulation strategies as methods of managing
language barriers in global teams. Emotional regulation refers to methods by which we
manage and respond to an emotional experience, both consciously or unconsciously
manage our feelings.31 Respondents in the study reported methods such as staying silent
in meetings if they lacked confidence in speaking the shared language, or simply failing to
attend, to avoid anxiety and shame. They also reported excluding those who only spoke
the shared language in both meetings and electronic communication.
How can managers and employees help resolve these issues?
Clearly, speaking a foreign language in multicultural teams creates anxiety, particularly for
those who perceive their skill at speaking a particular language to be insufficient. They’re
unlikely to take risks and to make themselves vulnerable, reducing the chance that they
will gain recognition for their positive contribution to the team. So, what can be done?
Leaders and managers are of course vital here, not only in raising awareness of language
barriers and their consequences, but potentially using their privilege to uphold language
discipline and guide code-switchers back to the shared language, if necessary. More
broadly, staff throughout the team should regularly highlight the task-related achievements
of each team member in meetings to counteract the perceptions of them as incompetent,
encouraging colleagues to look beyond their language proficiency and acknowledge their
skill elsewhere.
Those struggling as a result of their own language proficiency can also use emotion
regulation more positively by taking a step back to understand and reframe the cause
of their anxiety and changing their response to it. For example, in the previous study,
respondents motivated themselves to get accustomed to the shared team language
in order to help others have better access to the team information. This meant they
associated the language with empathetic rather than unpleasant emotions.
Overall, creating an environment that values diversity as a source of creativity and
encourages open communication across language barriers is an important goal. In fact,
proposing ‘poor English’ as the official language of the organisation may be more effective
than aiming for flawless expression.

Manager insights
Given time and support, multicultural teams can thrive
The benefits and challenges of multicultural working were more keenly felt by APAC and
ME respondents, who reported having more diverse teams than UK respondents. Many of
the benefits highlighted align with the literature explored above.

Participants saw innovation
and creativity as the key
benefits of cultural diversity.

Participants experienced
more of the challenges of
working in multicultural
teams, particularly around
communication.

Participants experienced
similar communication
challenges, but greatly valued
the innovation of their teams.

First, although participants acknowledged that multicultural teams are inherently
challenging, they felt that perseverance can reap great rewards. For example, several
respondents noted that considering multiple perspectives often takes time, and sometimes
these perspectives have to be discussed and explained to different members of the team.
But the time and effort this takes is more than made up for by the diversity of experience
and thought that is brought to the table, and is incredibly rewarding and effective for
problem-solving and generating new ideas.

It’s a great experience – you can generate the best ideas and
solutions to problems based on diversity of background.
Sometimes you have to take time to communicate things clearly
and to check understanding, as it can take more time up front to
align common understanding. (focus group member, ME)
Related to this is innovation and creativity. Participants recognised the strength of
diversity, and that having a multicultural team encourages members to see not just
themselves and their customers, but what they produce, from different angles. This
encourages the creation of new and more relevant services for a variety of customers. On
a more personal note, participants noted that they appreciate and enjoy simply learning
about people’s different cultures, traditions and even things like food and humour. As a
result of this, they feel more well rounded as individuals. It’s no wonder that two words
used more frequently than others among participants were ‘enriching’ and ‘enlightening’.
Enabling their members to learn and appreciate new things about their colleagues means
that multicultural teams thrive when given time to innovate and take new approaches to
problem-solving.
Communication in multicultural teams is essential, but challenging
Respondents generally felt the initial stages of working in a multicultural team to be the
most challenging, as this is when misconceptions, and even stereotyping, lead to certain
members’ ideas being side-lined or undermined. As mentioned, patience is paramount,
since understanding different cultures and ways of working takes time and must be
worked on in order to develop.

While respondents recognised the essential nature of communication in effective
teamwork, this was highlighted as the most prominent challenge in multicultural teams.
With varying levels of proficiency in the shared language (key to clear and effective
communication), participants reported incidents of ‘code-switching’, or switching from the
shared language to members’ native language.

Different cultures may have different assumptions about why
somebody is quiet. Is it lack of language competence? Does
it mean agreement or disagreement? These are all realistic
interpretations. (focus group member, APAC)

The complexity of language is a key challenge, according to respondents. This includes
the use of accents and slang, as well as cultural nuances like staying silent to respect a
speaker rather than speaking up. Working to understand these complexities and using
inclusive language, where possible, is important. Participants reported that people from
certain cultures tend to communicate in particular ways; as such, being aware of – and
understanding – these was a key skill to learn.

Very often different people interpret the same thing differently,
and so being sensitive while communicating is very
important. (focus group member, ME)
Cultural diversity in teams presents opportunities and challenges for workplace teams. One
way of overcoming the challenges and harnessing the potential of multicultural teams is by
developing cultural intelligence (CQ), discussed below.

	Embracing multicultural teams
through cultural intelligence

Section summary
• Cultural intelligence (CQ [cultural quotient]), or the ability to successfully interact
among diverse cultures, is one way of embracing multiculturalism in teams and is
particularly important for global leaders.
• Cultural intelligence can be developed through perspective-taking and suspending
judgements about others. Greater CQ is linked to enhanced performance, greater
job satisfaction and knowledge-sharing, among other outcomes.
• Managers highlight the importance of flexibility in approaching cultural diversity
in teams, being attentive to individual differences and working styles, rather than
taking a one-size-fits-all approach to management.
• Participants feel the need for formal and informal training on cross-cultural
competence. In particular, more implicit, ‘on the job’ learning is perceived as useful
for building trust in multicultural teams.

An extensive stream of research has been developed in the last decade or so that explores
the importance of cross-cultural competence and cultural intelligence in allowing culturally
diverse teams to thrive.
As businesses become more global, cultural intelligence (CQ) – an individual’s knowledge,
skill and ability to function and interact effectively in culturally diverse situations – is
essential.33 Not only will those who possess CQ be able to harness the benefits of
multiculturalism, but they will also manage some of the challenges raised earlier. In
highlighting individuals’ potential to meet the demands of different cultural contexts, this
definition of CQ aligns with the broader definition of intelligence, which emphasises the
ability to adapt to one’s environment.34
Cultural intelligence shares some similarities with inclusive behaviours – showing respect to
those who are different from us and ensuring everyone has a say. This is discussed in greater
detail in the CIPD’s research report on building inclusive workplaces. Cultural intelligence is
distinguished from inclusive behaviours, and indeed simply being a good manager, because
it focuses specifically on awareness of – and sensitivity to – cultural diversity.
Leaders need to develop cultural intelligence as a matter of priority
Research35 outlines attributes through which cultural intelligence can be achieved, suggesting
that perhaps the most important ability of a culturally intelligent individual is to suspend
judgement about another person until they have enough information to understand whether
that person will ‘think, feel and behave’ in the way that their culture might suggest. While
culture can suggest how someone may think or behave, other individual factors, such as
personality, should be understood before making a judgement. Situational factors are also
important; a culturally intelligent person should look at the situational context and use this
before making a judgement on the culture of someone else. Finally, the paper highlights the
issue of ethnocentrism – that is, people feel that the norms of their culture are, or should
be, the norm everywhere. This type of bias is difficult to overcome because ‘in some sense
one goes against “human nature”’. However, through undertaking training, involving showing
empathy by understanding the perspective of someone else and walking in their shoes,
individuals can learn to gain a better appreciation for other cultures.
More research36 highlights the importance of cultural intelligence through interviews
with global leaders in six multinational companies. This research found that first-hand,
cross-cultural leadership is key for the development of leaders. Through engaging with
this development, leaders acknowledge the value of cultural sensitivity, networks and
relationships. Not only does this learning provide a vital developmental role, but it’s essential
if global leaders are to successfully fulfil their roles. The research suggests that global leaders
should approach development in a dynamic, ad hoc way, evaluating new situations and
continuously improving their cross-cultural understanding through learning from mistakes.
Outcomes of cultural intelligence
One systematic review37 of cultural intelligence links it to several positive outcomes.
Notably, evidence finds CQ to have a positive influence on cross-cultural job performance
– both task performance (fulfilling in-role obligations) and contextual performance
(going beyond one’s role to help the organisation more widely).38 The same goes for job
satisfaction.39 Another study40 found that employees’ increased CQ led to better task
performance in global virtual teams when contact intensity with the leader increased.
In terms of enhancing performance, the speed at which performance improved in
multicultural teams was greater for those with higher, rather than lower, levels of CQ.41

CQ was also found to promote knowledge-sharing among multicultural teams.42 Indeed, CQ
has been found to enhance the quality of social exchanges between individuals from diverse
culture backgrounds, with one study43 finding that higher CQ reduced the negative association
between knowledge-hiding and creativity; the higher the individual’s level of CQ, the less
negative the relationship. This suggests that CQ helps individuals overcome negative processes
of social categorisation in intercultural environments and, in turn, enhances creativity.
CQ has also been shown to be a particularly important characteristic of leaders. Leaders
with CQ are more likely to enable integration into multinational teams44 and boost expatriate
adjustment and performance.45 Moreover, CQ has been shown to predict international
leadership potential – the judgements outside observers make about future performance
of a leader.46 This is important because, unlike judgements of actual performance, which is
retrospective, judgements of future performance are prospective and are the basis of important
selection decisions. CQ was also found to be positively related to leadership effectiveness,
specifically in the context of cross-border activities47 and culturally diverse teams.48

Manager insights
Leaders should take a flexible approach to managing cultures and personalities
While focus group respondents did not explicitly reference cultural intelligence, they
highlighted a number of similar characteristics – empathy, emotional intelligence, patience
and active listening, among others – that they felt were needed to support and get the
most from their multicultural teams. Another characteristic – flexibility – was cited as the
most important for a leader to have.
This is because there is no clear, flawless formula or one-size-fits-all approach to managing such
teams. But, by understanding when to consider and alter their approach to reflect the context,
and by having a genuine interest in other cultures and working styles, leaders can be agile,
prepared and, subsequently, increase their chances of effective and successful management.
This includes adjusting their leadership style for different individuals, particularly when
interacting with them one-to-one. As the literature on cultural intelligence states, someone’s
culture – while a reasonable indicator of their behaviour – may indeed be less influential than
their personality. Thus, individual differences, more than cultural differences, may require
leaders to change their approach – for example, adjusting how they communicate, their
body language or their tone. While some respondents, particularly from the UK group, were
keen to ‘treat everyone the same’, most highlighted the importance of fair treatment, where
different approaches are taken for different individuals and their unique circumstances.

I had to find a more direct approach with certain team
members and a more persuasive nature with others. As a new
manager, it took a few tough lessons to ensure I was flexing
my managing style. (focus group member, UK)
The need for training
Participants called for a mix of formal and informal training to provide them with the skills
to communicate with – and adapt to – different cultures.
Those from the ME and APAC regions were more likely than UK respondents to have taken
part in formal training to build cross-cultural competence, but respondents from each
group shared their experiences of training. According to respondents, training is often part
of the onboarding process or as a module in ongoing training, such as online and diversity
training. ME and APAC respondents also noted training for expatriates to be common.

Unfortunately, respondents did not always perceive this training as sufficient. While
training on cultural nuances, particularly those from different employee resource groups,
was seen as useful at the time, there is a disconnect between training sessions and dayto-day interactions. Respondents put this down to factors such as training often being
isolated and not tied to values or performance outcomes.
Respondents placed more emphasis on implicit training, learned ‘on the job’ through
observation and informal conversations. The respondents felt more positively about this
because it allows them to build trust with their teams and ensure members of the team
feel a mutual respect. Although formal training was appreciated, sessions that appear
to be box-ticking exercises more than genuine attempts at learning were seen as less
effective than learning softer skills and adapting to unique situations.

I believe most learning happens when people see their leaders
respect diversity and work with this. (focus group member, ME)

Developing an awareness of cultural differences and nuances is key for successful
managers of multicultural teams. The final section explores how leaders manage cultural
diversity in teams that work remotely in different geographical locations and time zones.

virtual teams

Section summary
• The evidence base on the effect of remote working on multicultural teams has
grown in the last two decades, as homeworking becomes more common.
• Global virtual teams benefit from the varied perspectives of culturally diverse
members, but face challenges of working in different time zones and maintaining
effective communication online.
• Managers’ flexibility in dealing with different patterns of communication in their
teams is key to responding to individuals’ needs.
• While multicultural teams, especially those in the UK, have felt the strain of the
pandemic and changes to work, managers are generally optimistic, and report
positive effects of working virtually, such as greater productivity as a result of less
commuting.
• Ensuring the team catches up regularly is key to maintaining engagement and
involvement and avoiding isolation.

Geographic dispersion presents unique challenges to virtual multicultural teams
Given the steady rise in employees working from home over the last two decades, the
evidence base on the geographical dispersion of multicultural teams has flourished. The
global crisis caused by the COVID-19 pandemic has seen a dramatic spike in remote
collaboration that has remained at a relatively stable level for the best part of a year. There
is now a great deal of research exploring the effects of remote working on multicultural
teams, which is more relevant than ever in such uncertain times.
Global virtual teams (GVTs) are those whose members are often culturally diverse and
whose tasks are usually conducted internationally through communication technology,
rather than face-to-face.50 One study summarises current knowledge on GVTs, focusing on
the key drivers that influence their success and ways to mitigate their challenges.
Given that GVTs are often made up of culturally diverse members, the opportunities they
present are similar in nature to those of multicultural teams who work together in a fixed
location. A growing body of research highlights the cultural diversity of GVTs as improving their
effectiveness through providing a variety of perspectives, facilitating creativity and problemsolving.51 Where homogenous teams may encounter ‘groupthink’ and narrow-mindedness,
more diverse global teams are likely to consider alternative solutions to a problem.52
Some challenges that multicultural teams face are unique to being virtual. First, working
in different time zones presents hurdles, particularly to maintaining a healthy work–life
balance and sharing tacit knowledge over online communication.53 There is also a great
deal of discussion over the richness of media used to maintain communication in global
virtual teams. Research argues that gestures, tone and intonation, so important to face-toface discussions, are lost when communicating through text or audio channels.54
Recently published CIPD research into virtual teams explores these issues in detail.
Research finds that virtual teams can be less effective the more they use electronic media
to communicate because they share less information with each other, provide delayed
feedback, and find it more difficult to understand the information they are given. However,
rich media, such as video calls, may be able to influence this relationship more positively
and be used as a good alternative for in-person communication.
The opportunities and challenges of virtual teams are discussed in the CIPD’s evidence review.

Manager insights
Multicultural teams have been affected by the pandemic and homeworking,
but remain optimistic about the future
Participants were very much affected by the COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent
workplace changes, with the majority working from home at the time of data collection.
There were, of course, uncertainties expressed. Those in the UK group in particular, whose
industries were more varied, felt concerned about how their industries would adapt, with
some participants facing furlough. There was also a general feeling of anxiety around
the pandemic itself and a desire to stay safe and free from infection. However, they were
broadly accepting of the situation and were trying to embrace any benefits.

The retail industry is very tough and there were redundancy
worries before COVID, so I feel like this has just heightened it.

Those in the APAC and ME groups expressed more optimism. In APAC countries, in particular,
there were more cases of workers returning to offices as lockdown measures began to ease.
Generally, respondents highlighted the key skills needed during a crisis as similar to those
needed in more ‘typical’ work conditions: empathy, attentiveness, emotional intelligence
and active listening. However, communication was cited as especially important. Simply
bringing the team together and ensuring everyone can have a catch-up – be it work- or
non-work-related – was seen as key to keeping team members feeling engaged and
involved. Typically, managers noted four ‘Cs’ by which they are abiding during the crisis:
calm, compassionate, controlled and clear communication. This was seen as paramount
to ensuring team members feel supported.

We communicate more, have a regular rhythm for both the team
and individual team members. (focus group member, APAC)
I actually think this has weirdly brought the team closer
together. Especially when we get the whole team together just
for a general check-in and catch-up. (focus group member, UK)
Many even reported positive effects of remote working, notably an uptick in productivity
and focus as a result of fewer distractions at home than in the office. Regular team catchups and huddles were noted as important in this regard, not only to ensure everyone stays
connected and up to speed with each other’s work, but to ensure each member of the
team is accountable for their work.

[The] team has overall been amazing; they feel more
productive. In the beginning we were all exhausted, as
everything was reactive, but recently it is becoming more
balanced and we are learning how to do virtual working
sessions and not just task-orientated meetings. (ME)
Managers recognise the benefits of greater productivity and more free time,
but acknowledge communication challenges
There have been some clear benefits – both practical and emotional – to remote working,
according to respondents. On a practical level, managers and workers alike have found
themselves with more free time and a greater work–life balance as a result of having no
commute. Respondents from APAC and ME, in particular, noted that they were sometimes
working remotely and with colleagues from different regions before the pandemic, making
their transition to full-time homeworking more smooth. More generally, respondents noted
greater productivity, engagement, collaboration and more focused decision-making.

I think generally the people are quite happy; they spend less
time commuting, and that translates to better productivity
too. (focus group member, APAC)
As mentioned, regular informal meetings provide more emotional support for workers.
Alongside more regular team social events, these ensure members can come together and
bond with one another. While there was initial trepidation towards working remotely, many
respondents indicated they feel more trusting in their colleagues, as they see evidence of
them completing tasks independently and successfully.

Managers of multicultural teams have, however, faced a series of challenges as a result of
increased remote working. Communication issues, a major barrier to multicultural team
effectiveness, have been exacerbated during the pandemic, with managers reporting
that they struggle to gauge the appropriate level of contact and communicate in both a
succinct and empathetic way. Managers reported that adapting to the different needs of
their members of staff is a challenge, with some finding it difficult to express themselves
and be confident over video calls, making effective communication more challenging.
Indeed, returning to language barriers in multicultural teams, some team members whose
language proficiency is limited may be more comfortable with email than video calls as
this allows them more time to consider their response. Again, this requires flexibility on
the part of the manager to respond to the needs of their individual team members. This is
once again discussed in greater detail in the CIPD’s evidence review on virtual teams.

I feel I can manage better seeing someone’s body language
and facial expression than through a conference call. (focus
group member, UK)
Practically, remote working was seen to cause issues around setting up an appropriate
workstation, dealing with technology issues and balancing home and familial
responsibilities. These issues were noted to cause anxiety around the intrusive nature of
video calling and balancing work and home life, with some commenting that they often
work longer hours than usual.

Remote work doesn’t impact productivity for my team; to the
contrary… people end up working more, not knowing how to
separate work and life. (focus group member, APAC)

Conclusion and recommendations

Cultural diversity brings with it the potential for open and creative teams whose members
respect the fresh perspectives of each other, as well as the risk of conflict as values and
attitudes clash. Through exploring the literature and conducting a qualitative study,
this report provides a greater understanding of the influencing factors that need to
be harnessed in order to overcome the challenges inherent to multicultural teams to
enable them to perform effectively. An inclusive workplace should embrace these fresh
perspectives and provide guidance to sensitively manage any issues. This is where the role
of people professionals is so vital.

Multicultural teams require patience and openness to
be effective
Cultural diversity presents challenges to effective teamwork, as different perspectives
have to be recognised to ensure all members remain involved and engaged. While people
of different cultures may understand and work in different ways, a team’s ability to view
problems from different perspectives can unlock its potential and create a path to greater

creativity, innovation and a fresh approach to work. This requires leaders who show cultural
intelligence, reading the context of the situation and remaining open and empathetic to
the values and experiences of others to successfully mediate culturally diverse situations.
How employers and people professionals can foster patience and openness
• Show sensitivity not only to employees’ demographic differences, but to their different
values, attitudes and experiences too.
• Encourage employees to seek these attitudes and use the different perspectives of
others, not only to enhance team decision-making, but to learn more about each other
on a personal and professional level.
• Suspend your judgement about another person until you have enough information
about them, their cultural values and whether these influence how they act.
• Think flexibly about how to manage different individuals in your teams, avoiding a
blanket approach. Try to treat your people in a way that suits them, making small
changes that cater to individual needs rather than ‘treating everyone the same’.

Communication is a challenge to master
It is not surprising that communication was cited as the main consideration for
multicultural teams in both the research literature and the focus groups. Communication
in any team is key to developing relationships, trust and team cohesion. Leaders have a
key role to play here, not only in managing their teams more broadly through making their
teams aware of the consequences of language barriers, celebrating the success of team
members away from their language proficiency and upholding language discipline, but at
a more individual level, using active listening and empathy to seek to better understand
cultural nuances and communication styles.
While the effectiveness of cultural competence training was questioned by respondents, there
is appetite for more of it in the form of online resources, support during onboarding and
informal mentoring. A more implicit, personal approach to training may be more beneficial –
again, highlighting the need for patient, emotionally intelligent and flexible leaders.
How employers and people professionals can overcome communication
challenges
• Raise awareness of language barriers in team meetings to ensure that everyone
understands instructions and tasks and does not feel hesitant to contribute.
• Don’t be afraid to nudge ‘code-switchers’ back to the shared language, if necessary.
Having a conversation with the team members about why they change language and
what can be done to promote effective, open communication across language barriers,
rather than expecting flawless expression, may be useful, too.
• Highlight the achievements of each team member in meetings; this way, colleagues will
recognise their skill beyond their language proficiency.
• Listen attentively for different cultural nuances of communication from different team
members. Being switched on to these will allow you to monitor your staff’s contributions
more closely and encourage active discussion from all team members.

Remote working resolves some issues, but exacerbates others
There are understandably concerns given the huge shake-up of traditional working patterns,
with more and more employees working from home and on furlough. Global virtual teams face
similar challenges to more fixed teams as a result of these changes, with the added challenge
of maintaining a healthy work–life balance over different time zones. However, many are
positive about the benefits of remote working – notably increased productivity and focus. Once

again, communication is the greatest challenge. Maintaining regular contact through hangouts
and catch-ups is key to reducing the risk of isolation. Successful long-term remote working will
rely heavily on managers maintaining regular communication and being flexible to individual
needs and styles of working to get the most out of multicultural teams in the future.
How employers and people professionals can make the most of remote
working
• Encourage the use of rich media, such as video-conferencing, where possible. This will
allow staff to share feedback and their perspectives and resolve differences quickly.
• When working across time zones, build awareness of the best time intervals for team
members to meet. Allowing staff flexible working hours will not only allow them to
collaborate more often with their colleagues, but will reduce the likelihood of them
working overtime.
• Get to know the communication preferences of your people as well as you can – some
may feel more comfortable communicating in certain ways, such as over email. Being
flexible to their desires will boost their confidence in communicating.
• Regularly bring the team together for catch-ups and hangouts. Be creative with this –
as well as regular work meetings and project updates, create tasks, games and social
sessions to allow the team to touch base and provide support for each other.
Multicultural teams are an increasingly common feature of modern working life and require
deliberate and sensitive management informed by good evidence. We have summarised
some of this evidence and highlighted some key factors that should be considered in order to
positively influence culturally diverse teams. We have also provided some key insights into how
managers perceive their teams, particularly in light of the COVID-19 pandemic and the rapid
shift to remote working. Employers should of course seek to understand their own workforces
directly, being attentive to their unique make-up. However, if we can lean on these key
influences, there are substantial benefits to be had from well-managed multicultural teams.
