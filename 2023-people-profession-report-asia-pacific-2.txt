1 Introduction

As we settle into the post-pandemic ‘new normal’, we see significant shifts
in the behaviours of workers and workplaces, which have brought new
challenges and opportunities for the people profession.
Macro trends, including advancing technology and digital transformation,
economic instability, the transition to net zero and new models of working,
are driving constant change. It is under these conditions that businesses need
to adapt or risk being left behind. It’s up to senior leaders and people teams
to influence and shape current strategy and people practice to navigate this
ever-changing landscape.

Aims of this report
This report gives a snapshot of the current HR landscape in the Asia-Pacific
region, specifically in Australia, Hong Kong, Malaysia and Singapore. It
provides insights into how external factors are impacting current HR practices,
and the challenges and opportunities these bring. It also explores how people
professionals perceive their careers and working lives amidst these changes.
We investigate the following questions and give recommendations on how
people professionals can navigate the challenges they are facing:
• What are the key drivers of change for organisations?
• What are the top workforce priorities for organisations?
• How are people management tasks being delegated?
• How is digital transformation changing the way people teams operate?
• What is the impact of hybrid working on people practice?
• How does people professionals’ work affect their wellbeing?
• How are practitioners developing their skills and capability?
• How do people professionals feel about their career prospects and progression?
Our accompanying international survey report explores how global issues
are affecting regions differently by comparing findings in nine countries
across Asia-Pacific, the Middle East and North Africa, the UK and
Ireland. In addition to the questions above, it also looks at how people
professionals across the world perceive:
• the impact and value of people teams
• how the role of people professionals is changing
• how people professionals are using evidence in practice
• the role of HR in the sustainability agenda.
As well as this Asia-Pacific report, we also provide individual reports for
the Middle East and North Africa region, the UK and Ireland, and Canada.

A note on the survey findings
• The findings are based on the perspectives of those who took part in
the People Profession survey in April and May 2023.
• We refer to the ‘people profession’ throughout this report, which
includes a range of people-related roles, such as human resources
(HR), learning and development (L&D), organisational development
(OD), employee relations and other HR specialisms. It does not include
people managers.
• Our sample included those responsible for HR, both in-house and as
independent consultants.
• The data collection, carried out by the CIPD and YouGov, was
conducted across Australia, Hong Kong, Malaysia and Singapore. The
sample is diverse, and each country will have different contextual
factors influencing the findings.
• Reported percentage figures are rounded up and therefore the total
may be above 100%.

Introduction

People Profession 2023: Asia-Pacific survey report

2 Asia-Pacific findings

The Asia-Pacific (APAC) countries included in this sample vary significantly in
their cultural context, economic climate and political backdrop. This also plays
out in the variations within the people profession itself and people practices
generally. However, given the geographical proximity and the likelihood
that businesses (and people teams) operating in these regions will have
professional relationships with their neighbouring markets, it is useful to have
a closer comparison of the differences and commonalities between them.
In certain instances, it is useful to see how the Asia-Pacific region compares
with the global sample surveyed (see our accompanying People Profession
2023: International survey report). Where there are significant similarities or
contrasts, this may be referenced.

What are the key drivers of change for organisations?
In terms of the levers that are driving change for businesses within these
markets, Table 1 shows the top-ranked trends. As with the global sample
in our accompanying international survey report, the impact of economic
change, digital transformation and flexible ways of working are commonly
cited by people professionals as prominent drivers. Evidence of these trends
is supported by in-region policy changes. For example, the minimum wage
increased by 5.75% in Australia in July 2023, to help workers with the rising
costs of living.1
However, there are some standout differences where particular regions are
being impacted by different challenges.
For example, in Australia, digital transformation was ranked as the top trend,
suggesting that the impact of technology is disproportionately higher than the
global sample (37%, compared with the global sample average of 28%).
In Hong Kong, people professionals were significantly more likely than
the global sample and the other APAC respondents to cite drivers such as
demands for flexible ways of working, industrial change and organisational
agility, changing employment relationships, responsible business and social
impact, and globalisation.
For Malaysian people professionals, social media and content consumption
was perceived as particularly influential, compared with the global sample.
Practitioners from Singapore were most likely to rank changing workforce
demographics and digital technology platforms as a top trend influencing
change, compared with the global sample.

Question: Which of the following, if any, are drivers of change in your [client] organisation? (Please tick up to three responses.)

What are the top workforce priorities for organisations?
Despite APAC countries using remote hiring strategies,2 evidence suggests
that recruitment remains a challenge. For example, in one survey, nearly
half of employers in Australia cited it as a key concern3 and another report
demonstrated that over half of businesses across the APAC region currently
rely on a contingent workforce to support talent shortages.4
With persistent recruitment challenges, employers and people teams
are turning to their current workforce to plug the skills gaps and build a
workforce that can sustain and grow their businesses. In this survey, we found
that respondents from Australia, Malaysia and Singapore are focusing on
developing and building skills as a top priority area, significantly more than
the rest of the global sample. Other research also supports this finding, with
56% of senior HR leaders saying employee training and development is an
important area of focus in 2023.5
Additionally, we also found workforce planning to be a core focus area in
Australia, Hong Kong and Malaysia. This is a key strategy for managing talent
and addressing skills gaps and associated business and operational risk. Unlike
the global sample, the majority of APAC countries have less of a focus on
recruitment, with the exception of Singapore.
Across all countries, engaging with the workforce is a unanimous priority area.
This suggests that, for many of our APAC respondents, a cultural reset is needed
to focus on employee experience, engagement and building culture in a postpandemic workplace.

Question: Which, if any, of the following are your [client] organisation’s workforce priorities? (Please tick up to three responses.)

How are people management tasks being delegated?
Delegation to line managers
Out of the four APAC markets surveyed, Hong Kong people professionals
were most likely to delegate people management tasks to line managers, in
particular learning and development, absence management, interviewing
candidates and posting job adverts (see Figure 1).
However, on average, the APAC region is less likely to delegate to the line
compared with those in the UK and Ireland, but more likely to than those in
the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region. Where delegation to the line
is more common, it is critical that people teams provide support, advice and
training to line managers to ensure effective people operations are carried out
and that managers feel equipped to do so.

Question: Are line managers in your [client] organisation responsible for any of the following? (Please select all that apply.)

Outsourcing of HR functions
Hong Kong people teams outsource more HR functions than other countries
in this region, including project management, basic HR advice, specialist
and complex advice, as well as strategic support (see Figure 2). Given the
higher levels of delegation to the line and outsourcing, this finding identifies
a potential risk when it comes to generalist skills within Hong Kong’s talent
pipeline. For example, the CIPD HR talent trends report, based on insights
from people professionals in Singapore, Malaysia and Brunei, highlights that
business partnering is a critical skill that supports career progression into more
senior roles. However, 33% of respondents in Hong Kong said they outsource

business partnering and strategic support. Without the breadth of generalist
knowledge, progression into such roles could become more difficult for junior
professionals in the future.
Malaysian respondents are most likely to outsource their administrative HR
duties. This finding is also supported by the CIPD HR talent trends report,
which found that people teams in Asia are increasingly shifting away from
perceptions of being a supportive function, and moving towards becoming
a strategic partner that influences business decisions. To support this
transition, outsourcing offers additional resource to alleviate transactional HR
responsibility, such as administrative duties.
In contrast, a third of the Singapore sample said they don’t outsource any HR
function, which is a similar level to the UK.

People Profession 2023: Asia-Pacific survey report

How is digital transformation changing the way people teams operate?
Our research shows that the impact of digital change on HR operations is
particularly influential in Australia, Malaysia and Singapore, compared with the
global sample. In these countries, the vast majority (69–77%) agreed that digital
transformation and new technology is changing how people teams deliver
HR to the wider business (see Figure 3). Considering that our sample consists
of both large organisations and SMEs (for example, the Australia sample was
70% SMEs), this highlights that the digital influence is widespread, even within
smaller organisations and people teams, where investment in new technology
and building digital skills is likely to be lower than in larger businesses.
Malaysia and Singapore respondents were most likely to say that their HR
operating models are changing significantly (or are currently being reviewed),
compared with the wider sample. Despite 77% of Australian respondents
agreeing that digital change is transforming people team operations, and
62% agreeing that individual roles are evolving, substantially less believed the
operating models of people teams are also being reviewed or significantly
disrupted (55%). This suggests some disparity between the proportion of
people roles changing while operating models appear less disrupted.

What is the impact of hybrid working on people practice?
Compared with the global sample, Australian practitioners were generally most
likely to say that hybrid working has impacted people management positively
and, specifically, that it makes people objectives easier to deliver (see Figure 4).
In comparison, Singapore respondents more commonly said that hybrid
working has made HR delivery more difficult – this is generally in line with UK
people professionals’ views. Respondents have found particular challenges in
supporting employees’ mental health and wellbeing, and attracting, recruiting
and retaining talent (39% for both). Comments from Singaporean survey
respondents identified several challenges around managing people and
monitoring performance and work tasks.

“It’s harder to communicate, harder to directly manage and
measure performance, harder to bring about a ‘human touch’
within the company.” (Survey respondent)
“Some of the biggest challenges of hybrid work include culture,
connectedness and communication, productivity, motivation,
stress management and balance.” (Survey respondent)
Other respondents highlighted that supportive line managers are critical when
considering the impact on people management:

“Both employees and managers need to be supported in how
to manage hybrid working – the culture needs to evolve to
build trust. Many leaders and managers cannot comprehend
the positives of hybrid working and actually don’t want to.”

Question: We are now going to ask you about some aspects of working as an HR/people professional. Please indicate how, if at all,
these have changed due to the shift towards ‘working from anywhere’ and hybrid working.

There are significant differences in perceptions of hybrid working when we
account for age and years of experience within the profession. For example,
younger people professionals (18–34 years) were more likely to perceive
people management as easier to deliver in a hybrid context (see Figure 5).
11

People Profession 2023: Asia-Pacific survey report

Early-career people professionals (those with up to five years’ experience
within the profession) were also more likely to believe hybrid working makes
people management easier.
It’s likely that people professionals with more years of experience are more
aware of the strategic challenges associated with hybrid and new ways of
working. However, the contrast in view brings into question whether working
preferences, adaptability and openness to change are factors that also affect
views of hybrid working. Are leaders and managers ready to embrace the
potential opportunities created by new ways of working?

these have changed due to the shift towards ‘working from anywhere’ and hybrid working.

Our findings highlight the cultural nuances and contrasting perceptions of
flexible and hybrid ways of working and its impact on business functioning.
The impact of hybrid working is also likely to be different across industries and
job roles, given that some roles and industries will be less flexible in nature.

Recommendations
Flexible working strategies
Hybrid, flexible and new ways of working are here to stay and will have
implications for people and business strategies. Therefore, understanding
how they impact people management is critical for people teams and
people managers. Recommendations for businesses operating across
APAC regions include the following:
• Be aware of the range of flexible working options available to determine
what your business can offer employees. Flexible working practices
include part-time working, compressed hours, flexi-time, job-sharing,
term-time hours, hybrid and remote working, and other practices.
• Be data-driven to inform how hybrid working may impact different
geographies and internal and external stakeholders. Our findings suggest
there are likely to be differences across markets and employee groups.
• Ensure leaders are aligned in their thinking across markets (and
between functions). It’s crucial to have a consistent approach to
dealing with the challenges and opportunities created by hybrid and
flexible working. Are leaders aligned and aware of the perceptions,
challenges and opportunities within their market?

Recommendations
Flexible working practices and supporting line managers
The role of the line manager is key to ensuring effective ways of working.
The following tips should help develop hybrid working practices and
support line managers:
• Engage with teams in establishing or revisiting hybrid ways of working
so that they feel they have an active voice. Agreed processes should
include how to communicate as a team and key principles that
everyone can work to.
• Ensure line managers are familiar with the organisation’s policies and
procedures for hybrid working.
• Ensure that line managers have regular one-to-one time with their
team, either online or face-to-face, or a mixture of both.
• Talk about wellbeing with employees and help people meaningfully
disconnect and manage their technology and work–life balance.
Act as a good role model with your own working practices. If you
work outside of traditional working hours, be clear that your working
arrangement does not set expectations for others to respond or action
work that is sent out of hours.

Asia-Pacific findings

People Profession 2023: Asia-Pacific survey report

• Line managers need to set clear objectives and performance measures.
They should focus on desired results and outcomes as the main
measure for performance. It is always good practice to have wellwritten objectives and provide regular feedback.
• Prioritise social connection, collaboration and innovation when
meeting colleagues onsite. This can include face-to-face meetings,
development events and social activities. You can also create online
social spaces for informal conversations and sharing when colleagues
are working remotely.
• If you are working in a hybrid way yourself, don’t forget to be clear
with your team about how to get in touch with you – and always
provide opportunities for employees to speak with you one-to-one.
For more advice, see our guide for people managers on supporting hybrid
working.

How does people professionals’ work affect their wellbeing?
Nearly two-fifths of Australian respondents said their work “very positively”
impacts their mental health (39%, compared with the global average of 16%)
and physical health (38%, compared with the global average of 14%). This is
significantly more positive than other APAC countries and is at odds with
research on the wider workforce being prone to stress.6
Interestingly, we found that 42% of Singapore practitioners feel ambivalent
about the impact of work on their mental health, in that their wellbeing was
neither positively nor negatively impacted. This was the highest proportion
across the sample. In addition, we also found that significantly fewer
practitioners reported a positive impact of work on their mental health. Other
global research suggests that only 52% of Singapore workers feel able to have
open conversations about their mental health at work,7 which could provide
some explanation for the high levels of neutral responses.
In line with other research, the CIPD HR talent trends report (covering
perspectives from Brunei, Malaysia and Singapore) found burnout to be a
prevalent issue among people teams, evidenced by lower engagement and
wellbeing results. This has stemmed from raised expectations and pressures,
particularly in dealing with talent retention issues and supporting the wider
workforce through the disruption of the pandemic. This suggests that the
longer-term impact of the pandemic and ongoing talent challenges has
influenced, and will likely continue influencing, people professionals’ health
and wellbeing.
We also note that, in Hong Kong, 15% did not answer these questions and
responded as “prefer not to say”, the highest proportion of this response. This
may suggest that wellbeing at work is a taboo subject or, at the very least, a
topic which practitioners feel less able to disclose an opinion on.

Recommendations
Given that health and wellbeing affects many work-related and personal
outcomes, senior leaders of the profession should:
• Consider the impact of work on their people teams to protect against
burnout. This is not only for the sake of the sustainability, retention
and performance of their HR functions, but also for individuals’
engagement, job quality and overall health. Leaders should consider a
holistic approach of flexible working options, progression opportunities
and setting clear boundaries between supporting the business and
looking after their personal needs.
• Take an evidence-based approach to understand the context and
current climate around health and wellbeing in different regions and
areas of the business, especially given the number of variables that
could be impacting on wellbeing outcomes.

• Help line managers to understand and better support those
experiencing stress and mental health issues.
Our guide on supporting mental health at work gives best practice
advice on promoting good mental health across the whole lifecycle of
employment, from recruitment, through managing mental health at
work, to supporting people returning to work after a period of absence.

How are practitioners developing their skills and capability?
For the majority of our APAC sample, improving their skills has been a focus,
with 77% on average saying that they have upskilled within the last 12 months.
Hong Kong respondents were most likely to say this (85%). Upskilling levels
across the APAC region are significantly higher than in the UK and Ireland,
where only 61% engaged in some form of upskilling.
On average, just over one in 10 said they have needed to reskill in new or
different areas of work. Additionally, only a small minority (11% on average)
said they haven’t upskilled in the last 12 months, compared with 23% of the
global average.
Key areas of capability improvement include:
• people data and analytics skills (especially in Malaysia and Singapore)
• facilitating more flexible people operations (especially in Hong Kong), which
supports the previous finding that exploring innovative, adaptive ways of
working is a key priority for the workforce
• building commercial knowledge (especially in Hong Kong)
• automating HR work (especially in Singapore and Australia)
• critical thinking skills (especially in Singapore) and understanding research
to inform decision-making (especially in Australia); as both of these
capability areas are core skills for evidence-based practice, it’s encouraging
to see this feature as a priority area.

Asia-Pacific findings

People Profession 2023: Asia-Pacific survey report

How do people professionals feel about their career prospects and
progression?
On average, 78% of APAC people professionals felt their career progression
had either met or exceeded their expectations. This was especially so for
Australian respondents (86%), the highest in our global sample.
While other research (on the wider workforce) suggests that over a third of
Singapore employees expect to be promoted in the next year,8 we found a
fifth of respondents felt their progression had failed to meet their expectations
(19%). They were the least satisfied across the global sample.
In terms of aspects that support career progression, skills development
remains firmly at the top (see Figure 9) and is reported as a key enabler by
three-quarters of Malaysian respondents. Compared with the global sample,
career sponsorship was more often cited across the APAC respondents, except
for Singapore professionals. Similarly, mentors are also a key enabler for
respondents from Hong Kong and Australia.

Question: If your career progression to date has met or exceeded your expectations, which of the following, if any, have helped
you to achieve career advancement? (Please tick all that apply.)

In terms of barriers to progression, we found this varied widely across the
APAC region. The most prevalent barriers in-region are as follows:
• Hong Kong: line manager relationships (28%).

Asia-Pacific findings

People Profession 2023: Asia-Pacific survey report

• Malaysia: organisational politics (18%). Interestingly, around half of the
respondents said they are very likely or somewhat likely to leave their
current organisation within the next 12 months and 70% will start looking
for new opportunities.
• Singapore: a lack of opportunities with their current employer (20%), higher
than the global average of 14%. This contributes insight to the previous
finding around the higher levels of dissatisfaction with career progression.
Additionally, around half the sample said they are very likely, or somewhat
likely, to leave their current organisation within the next 12 months and 59%
will start to look for new opportunities externally.
• Australia: a lack of experience (21%), significantly higher than the global
average of 6%.
Barriers to career progression are very nuanced across the APAC region,
and these findings provide some insight to the perceived hurdles for people
professionals in those countries. For Malaysia and Singapore, we also found a
significant proportion of respondents who are at flight risk (that is, at a high
risk of leaving their current organisation in the near future).

Recommendations
Line manager quality can have a big impact on the people they manage.
Given the significant flight risk of people professionals in certain regions,
HR leaders should:
• Emphasise the importance of ongoing performance and development
conversations to staff. For those with line management responsibility,
build performance metrics into their objectives, so they are recognised
for prioritising performance and the development of their staff.
• Ensure professionals with line management responsibility feel
confident to have performance and development conversations with
their direct reports. Where line managers need more support, consider
training options and providing clear information to encourage goodquality development conversations with their team. The CIPD’s latest
evidence review on effective people managers provides evidencebased insight on developing good managers.
• Find creative solutions to strengthen the employee experience,
especially if cost pressures mean that it is hard to compete against
external remuneration offers. This could include boosting career
development and skills through job rotations and secondments, and
upskilling practitioners through online learning, on-the-job training and
by supporting professional qualifications and certification (see the CIPD
HR talent trends report, based on insights of people professionals in
Singapore, Malaysia and Brunei, for further advice).

3 Methodology

The People Profession survey is a long-standing research programme that
showcases the current views of people professionals’ working lives and
careers. This survey has developed into an international snapshot of the
profession and provides the latest insights on people practices across the
globe. Our sample included CIPD members and non-members, and is a
mix of in-house and independent professionals from a range of specialisms
(including HR, learning and development (L&D), organisational development
(OD) and others). Full demographic details of our Asia-Pacific sample can be
found at the end of Section 2.

Survey instrument and method
Since 2018, the survey has been tested and refined, and what was originally
a UK-based survey has become an international survey instrument that has
now been piloted in over 14 countries through CIPD-led research, and in 20
countries alongside our research partners: the WFPMA, SHRM and AHRI.
This year, our data collection spans nine countries: Australia, Egypt, Hong
Kong, Ireland, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, Malaysia, Singapore, the United
Arab Emirates and the United Kingdom, with additional data from Canada,
collected by the Chartered Professionals in Human Resources Canada (CPHR
Canada). The findings are presented in a series of reports, including:
• the People Profession 2023: International survey report, which explores the
collective sample and makes comparisons across regions
• this report, the People Profession 2023: Asia-Pacific survey report, which
details the findings in Australia, Hong Kong, Malaysia and Singapore and
draws on in-region comparisons
• the People Profession 2023: Middle East and North Africa survey report,
which details the findings in Egypt, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and the
United Arab Emirates and draws on in-region comparisons
• the People Profession 2023: UK and Ireland survey report, which details the
findings in the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland and draws on
comparisons between the two
• the People Profession 2023: A Canadian perspective, which draws on
data and analysis from a separate survey conducted by the Chartered
Professionals in Human Resources Canada (CPHR Canada), and gives a
comparable view of the opportunities and challenges faced by people
professionals in Canada.
Commissioned by the CIPD, the data was collected by YouGov between
18 April and 27 May 2023 via an online survey. The survey was translated
into the official language of each country to ensure the questions
were accessible and correctly interpreted within each region. The data
analysis was conducted by the CIPD. We surveyed a total of 2,957 people
professionals; the sample sizes for each region are shown in Table 3.

The details of the CPHR Canada survey are included in the Canada report.
This data has been analysed and written by CPHR Canada.

Survey questions
Each year, the survey instrument is reviewed and refined where changes are
appropriate, or where there are new research questions to be explored. For the
2023 survey, we added new questions that explore attitudes and behaviours
around applying evidence and research in practice and people teams’
involvement in their organisation’s sustainability agenda. The findings from
these questions can be found in the People Profession 2023: International
survey report.
Where sample sizes are large enough, the data was cross-tabulated by
business size and sector. We also explore other demographic variables such
as age and experience within the profession throughout the reports, where
significant differences are noted. Where we compare with the global sample,
given the larger UK sample in comparison with other regions, the global
average percentages will be skewed towards the UK findings.

Supplementary data
We have included qualitative data collected throughout the survey and
through the CIPD’s research panel to provide some further context on the
quantitative data. We would like to thank those participants who contributed
their views and experience in relation to the key findings from the survey.
