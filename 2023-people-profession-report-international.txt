People Profession 2023: International survey report

1 Foreword

Since our last report in 2022, the landscape of work has undergone significant
change. Hybrid working is now much more entrenched and the emergence of
technology like generative AI is expected to have a profound and continuing
impact on jobs and industries globally. While the events of the world more
broadly seem tumultuous, it has never been as important as it is now to
ensure good and fair work, and to keep people at the forefront of business
innovation and change.
This year, our research provides an in-depth international view of the people
profession, gathering valuable insights from practitioners in Asia-Pacific,
the Middle East and North Africa, the UK and Ireland. We’ve also included a
separate comparative perspective from Canada, based on research from CPHR
Canada. It’s clear that there are shared challenges, but equally, the profession
is united by its role in supporting employee wellbeing, managing workplace
culture in a hybrid world and developing skills and talent across businesses.
There are so many opportunities for the profession to be innovative, and to
take the lead on transforming business and adopting new and beneficial ways
of working.
However, the role of the people professional is changing. With the rapidly
evolving world of work, practitioners will need to prioritise their own learning
and development to stay ahead of the curve. There is no doubt that the
strategic importance of people teams is growing, and practitioners must
ensure they are developing the capabilities and skills needed to be future-fit.
Being a resilient business partner with a solid understanding of your business
is critical to add real value, enabling change and good work, while also
increasing the visibility of the people function.
This report represents the CIPD’s commitment to give a voice to the people
profession at an international level. While we see significant differences in
cultural context, economic climate and political backdrop, we are also unified
by the opportunities before us. Given that people teams are increasingly
operating across regions, understanding the commonalities and contrasts of
our colleagues is essential to navigating the ever-changing landscape of work.

2 Introduction

As we settle into the post-pandemic ‘new normal’, we see significant shifts
in the behaviours of workers and workplaces, which have brought new
challenges and opportunities for the people profession across the world.
Macro trends, including advancing technology and digital transformation,
economic instability, the transition to net zero and new models of working,
are driving constant change. It is under these conditions that businesses
need to adapt or risk being left behind. It’s up to senior leaders and people
teams to influence and shape current strategy and people practice to
navigate this ever-changing landscape.

Aims of this report
This report gives a snapshot of the current HR landscape across different
regions of the world: Asia-Pacific, the Middle East and North Africa, the UK
and Ireland. It provides insights into how external factors are impacting
current HR practices, and the challenges and opportunities these bring. It
also explores how people professionals perceive their careers and working
lives amidst these changes.
This report explores how global issues are affecting regions differently. We
investigate the following questions:
• What are the key drivers of change for organisations?
• What are the top workforce priorities for organisations?
• What is the impact and value of people teams?
• How is the role of the people professional changing?
• What are essential skills for today’s people professionals?
• How are people teams developing their capability and skills?
• How are people management tasks being delegated?
• What is the impact of hybrid working on people practice?
• How are people professionals using evidence in practice?
• What is HR’s role in the sustainability agenda?
Our accompanying Asia-Pacific, Middle East and North Africa, UK and
Ireland, and Canada reports give regional perspectives on the key trends
influencing the world of work and offer recommendations on how people
professionals can navigate the challenges they are facing.

A note on the survey findings
• The findings are based on the perspectives of those who took part in
the People Profession survey in April and May 2023.
• We refer to the ‘people profession’ throughout this report, which includes
a range of people-related roles, such as human resources (HR), learning
and development (L&D), organisational development (OD), employee
relations and other HR specialisms. It does not include people managers.
• Our sample included those responsible for HR, both in-house and as
independent consultants.
• The data collection, carried out by the CIPD and YouGov, was
conducted across nine countries: Australia, Egypt, Hong Kong, Ireland,
the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA), Malaysia, Singapore, the United
Arab Emirates (UAE) and the United Kingdom (UK). The sample is
diverse, and each country will have different contextual factors
influencing the findings. We make some international comparisons for
interest and explore the data from each country in more detail within
the accompanying regional reports.
• The data collection for Canada was conducted and analysed by the
Chartered Professionals in Human Resources Canada (CPHR Canada).
Separate sample details are included within the accompanying
Canada report.
• Reported percentage figures are rounded up and therefore the total
may be above 100%.

3 External factors influencing
the current world of work
Technology and digital transformation
Managing digital transformation and advancing technology is an ongoing
trend influencing people’s working lives. Artificial intelligence (AI) has
developed in leaps and bounds since the start of 2023, with generative AI able
to create new content for mainstream users, given its user-friendly nature
and accessibility. However, AI comes with many considerations, for example
around workplace monitoring, workers’ autonomy and the call for more
governance on its use. There’s also the question around equality and fairness.
Data on ChatGPT search trends highlights that users tend to be based in
countries with a more skilled population,1 suggesting a widening digital divide.
AI will have a profound impact on people and people teams. Using AI will
transform how HR is carried out, making policy development, recruitment
and selection, and people data and analytics leaner and more efficient, which
leaves people professionals to focus on other areas of value. However, CIPD
research in the UK has found that HR is one of the least involved when it
comes to implementing AI. As the people experts within business, this is an
opportunity for HR to get involved, particularly where intelligent automation
(or other technology) is expected to significantly impact people.
We explore how digital transformation is changing the way people teams
operate on page 8, and in more detail in our accompanying regional reports.

Economic instability and the cost-of-living crisis
Businesses continue to operate under a backdrop of economic instability,
and many regions are experiencing a cost-of-living crisis.2 Typically, average
global inflation sits between 3% and 5%,3 but the current average inflation sits
at 9% worldwide, with economic pressures continuing to drive cost savings
and restrain business spending. Businesses have a keen eye on measuring
productivity and financial performance, and a key challenge in many markets
is recruitment and upskilling the existing workforce to manage skills gaps. The
countries included in this international report will be impacted differently by
the economic crisis, with some affected disproportionately more than others.

Sustainability strategy and reaching net zero
With over 70 countries committed to achieving net zero emissions by 2050,4
the transition will be a defining trend that will impact the future workforce.
It’s also an agenda that people professionals – who are values-led and
people-centric – are well placed to lead on. Transition to a net zero economy
will require large-scale changes, from global policy all the way through to
individual responsibility. The CIPD UK report Putting people professionals on
the road to net zero suggests that organisational change, workforce planning
and skills development are key to this transition, all of which are highly
dependent on people professionals.
We explore HR’s involvement in the sustainability agenda on page 23.

New models of working
A global study in 2021 found that the vast majority of workers had a preference
for hybrid working, but a year on, only 26% of CEOs said they have a strategy
on future ways of working.5 In 2023, homeworking levels have somewhat
stabilised, but remain higher than pre-pandemic levels. For example, recent
data found that 40% of the UK working population had worked from home
in 2023, compared with only 12% at the same time point in 2019.6 Flexible
working models have introduced new opportunities and challenges for
businesses and will require investment and insight to inform future hybrid
solutions. People professionals will be at the very heart of this agenda and are
expected to have their finger on the pulse in terms of understanding employee
expectations and prioritising employee experience without compromising
business operations and stakeholder demands – a tricky juggling act.
We explore how hybrid working has impacted people management in
different countries on page 18, and in more detail in our accompanying
regional reports.
The remainder of this report compares and contrasts findings across the
nine countries included in this sample.

2023: An international
comparison
What are the key drivers of change for organisations?
Looking across our international sample, including respondents from AsiaPacific (APAC), the Middle East and North Africa (MENA), and the UK and
Ireland, we can identify prominent trends that are impacting businesses across
all regions. These include the following:

People Profession 2023: International survey report

• Digital transformation and advancing technology: Regardless of region,
business size, sector, strategic level or years of experience within the
profession, for all people practitioners, the impact of digital change and
advancing technology is perceived as a prevalent driver of change. While we
found that respondents from the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA), Singapore
and Australia were more likely to cite this trend, at least a fifth of respondents
from each country highlighted this in their top three drivers of change.
• Economic change: The impact of the changing economy on businesses
is hitting regions differently. Our findings show that economic change and
rising costs were particularly prominent in the UK, Ireland and Australia,
whereas MENA and wider APAC countries were significantly less likely to
cite this as a key disruptor.
• Flexible, hybrid and new ways of working: This is here to stay and the
old ways of working simply aren’t an option for businesses to thrive in the
future. While respondents from Hong Kong and Singapore were most likely
to cite this trend, it was ranked in the top five by most regions.

Question: Which of the following, if any, are drivers of change in your [client] organisation? Please tick up to three responses.

Other prominent trends driving change in APAC and MENA countries include
the following:
• Social media and content consumption: We found proportionately more
respondents in MENA countries (25%) and APAC countries (19%) cite social
media as an important lever of change compared with the UK and Ireland (11%).
• Changing employment relationships: This trend is more influential in
MENA countries (23%) and APAC countries (18%) compared with the UK and
Ireland (9%).
• Globalisation and integrating international talent: This is driving change
more in MENA and APAC countries. According to other research, global
hiring has grown significantly in the APAC region, with Australia and
Singapore ranked as two of the top three countries hiring remotely in 2022.7
While these trends act as disruptors to businesses and the world of work, it’s
critical for people professionals to understand the impact they will have for
people practices in different regions.

People Profession 2023: International survey report

What are the top workforce priorities for organisations?
Perhaps in response to the increasing competition for talent, our findings
show that the majority of countries are developing their existing talent and
planning for their future workforce. Although recruitment and turnover
remain a priority, we’re seeing less focus on recruitment and competing for
talent, compared with the increased focus of developing talent internally and
workforce planning solutions. Malaysia, Singapore, Australia and the United
Arab Emirates (UAE) noted upskilling as their top workforce priority. Other
CIPD research based on UK data found that upskilling existing employees was
the most common response to recruitment difficulties for 60% of the sample.
Separate research by CPHR Canada also found that Canadian organisations
are experiencing recruitment challenges, with six in 10 of their survey
respondents citing it as very or extremely difficult, so retention strategies are
key in this region too.

Productivity and performance measures are also important for businesses,
with Ireland, KSA and Egypt noting this as their top priority area. Interestingly,
despite citing economic change as a key disruptor, measuring productivity
and performance is less of a priority for the UK and Australia, compared with
the majority of the sample.
CIPD evidence reviews on people performance, high-performing teams and
productive meetings provide the latest recommendations on productivity and
performance to support practice.
We consider people priorities in more depth in our accompanying regional
reports.

What is the impact and value of people teams?
Global research on senior leaders in the profession found that people teams
are growing in terms of headcount and strategic importance, with 74% saying
HR is more involved in their organisation’s strategic initiatives compared
with before the COVID-19 pandemic.8 However, there is often an underlying
tension between people teams’ strategic versus operational/transactional
remit, the value that both aspects bring to the business, and where
practitioners should prioritise their valuable time to best support business
functions. People professionals’ perceptions on contribution and recognition
of impact are shown in Figure 1.
Figure 1: Respondents from APAC countries are the most positive about their team’s strategic
impact and recognition by the business

While similar proportions of APAC and MENA respondents felt their people

(from both senior leaders and the wider business). Specifically, despite 64% of
respondents from the UK and Ireland agreeing that their people teams bring
strategic value to the table, less than half believed they are recognised for their
impact by the business (47%). This very much echoes the anecdotal tensions
that are felt within the profession by UK practitioners:

“Within the public sector, HR is seen as the personnel
department of days gone by. Despite many senior HR colleagues
and those entering the profession bringing innovative and
creative change to modern people practice and strategy,
organisations still aren’t getting the value we add to the bottom
line through positive stakeholder relations, and commercial and
business acumen.” (Survey respondent)
“My role is increasingly taking on a strategic leadership role
within the organisation. [HR is] no longer seen merely as an
administrative function but as a critical partner in shaping the
overall business strategy. I contribute to the development of
long-term plans, aligning the people plan with the organisational
goals, and driving initiatives that enhance employee engagement,
diversity and inclusion, talent development and organisational
culture.” (Survey respondent: Head of people and culture)
“HR has been rebranded to ‘People and Culture’ to denote the
change in focus from transactional HR to people strategy.”
(Survey respondent)
The CIPD UK-based report The value of people expertise on corporate boards
found that only a quarter of UK FTSE 350 boards have a member with HR
experience, suggesting that many organisations fail to recognise peoplerelated risks at board level. This could lead to a lack of understanding on
people issues and the value potential of the workforce. Just as financial risk
is prioritised and discussed, boards require knowledge of people practices,
policies and data to comprehensively inform their understanding of potential
workforce risks.
Professional credibility and accreditation can also influence strategic
perceptions. Our data suggests that perceptions around strategic value
differed significantly between CIPD members and non-members. Across the
global sample, on average, 70% of CIPD members agreed that their people
team contributes strategic value to the business, compared with 60% of nonmembers. For the UK sample, this difference was even more prominent, with
73% of CIPD members agreeing, versus just 59% of non-members.

The CIPD Profession Map sets the international standards of the profession
and the principles that govern how people professionals deliver value through
their work. Our resources support people, teams and organisations to use the
Profession Map to develop professional expertise and make an impact at work.
More details on strategic human resource management can be found in the
CIPD factsheet.

How is the role of the people professional changing?
People professionals’ opinions on how their roles are changing fell under
several common themes.

Using technology and digital solutions to improve
HR processes, communication and efficiency
“Digital platforms
and analytics mean that
change is demanded
quicker; as learning
specialists, we are
required to adapt quickly
to employee needs.”

“Digital
transformation is
changing the service
we offer.”

“Access to
digital solutions
has eliminated
unnecessary
paperwork and freed
up my time.”

Using data analytics to inform practice
and decision-making

“Data is driving business,
but people metrics are not
often black and white and
can be grey. I am spending a
lot of time coaching leaders
to interpret the data.”

“My role is becoming more
data-driven. I leverage people
analytics to gain insights
into various HR metrics, such
as employee performance,
turnover rates and workforce
demographics.”

Changing talent strategies
“Employment is much
more fluid now, so
a different approach
to staff retention and
hiring is required.”

Integrating wellbeing and equality, diversity and
inclusion (EDI) across the employee lifecycle
“EDI is coming
to the forefront of
the profession –
we’re being asked
to embed it into all
areas of HR.”

“CSR and EDI are
taking prominence
over traditional HR
functions.”

“We are focusing
more on people wellbeing,
but are mindful of costs.
Mental health has become
a much bigger topic and
HR is leading on how to
manage this.”

“HR has become
more socially
aware than ever to
include diversity
conditions.”

Managing employee expectations
across a diverse workforce
“Engagement is
paramount, and L&D is
a huge area of focus,
especially as the younger
workforce demands more
from roles.”

“Employees will demand
more visibility on
things like corporate
responsibility and expect
to have a greater hand in
shaping their workplace
and how it operates.”

Managing the impact of external disruptors
“People management used
to be more conflict, more
personal issues but, after
COVID, there are significantly
more wellbeing expectations
– physical and mental –
along with a number of
different EDI topics.”

The impact of organisational changes
on HR roles and responsibilities

Cost-cutting and
economic pressures

“The COVID crisis changed
the job landscape for many
businesses around the world.
Mass layoffs, the rise in
popularity of remote work and
other factors have transformed
the expectations that
employers and their employees
have for each other.”

“Change at strategic
levels has an impact
on the direction
and focus of OD
and L&D work.”

“Managing challenges
around public sector
budgeting and service demand,
pay and conditions for staff
due to the cost of living, and
ensuring good trade union
relationships [are key].”

The people profession 2023: An international comparison

People Profession 2023: International survey report

How are people teams developing their capability and skills?
Capabilities
A consistent area of focus across all regions is working more collaboratively
with colleagues across different functions. An integral part of people
professionals’ roles is partnering across business functions and ensuring
that the people strategy is closely aligned with the wider business goals.
Working with peers in areas such as finance, marketing and data enables
wider organisational change and ensures people management practices
are embedded across departments. It also supports co-dependencies and
knowledge-sharing. The CIPD’s effective cross-functional collaboration report
gives examples of how people professionals and their peers across Europe and
Asia-Pacific have worked closely together through crisis, including the key
learnings from their experiences.
As with previous years, we found that organisational development and change
management skills are a key improvement area for people professionals across
all regions. Given the turbulence people teams have been grappling with over
the last few years, this is unsurprising. Looking across the entire sample, we
note that only 15% of respondents identified organisational development,
design or change management as their specialist area. However, 67% said they
have some level of responsibility or decision-making within organisational
development and 56% in organisational design. This suggests that the majority
require some level of organisational development skills within their job role,
and this is creeping into the skillset required by HR generalists.
Interestingly, for the APAC and MENA regions, building more specialist
expertise was a key improvement area, with respondents from Hong Kong,
Malaysia and Australia more likely to cite this. At a global level, we found that
a significant proportion of the sample have responsibilities and influence
in specialist areas, for example workforce planning (68%), HR information
systems/people analytics (63%), equality, diversity and inclusion (71%), reward,
compensation and benefits (56%), organisational development (67%) and
organisational design (56%). However, when asked about their main HR
specialism, figures are much lower for the above people areas, suggesting that
many people professionals have influence and decision-making responsibility
for more than one specialist area, which may not be their main area of
expertise or where their professional qualifications lie.
Skills
Although building skills and capability across the workforce was found to be a
top priority for organisations, skills development within the people profession
itself is somewhat varied across the global sample. For example, although
the level of upskilling has remained consistent in the UK since 2022, we see
much lower levels of UK people professionals’ upskilling, compared with other
regions (see Figure 2).

Question: Which of the following statements best describes how your HR skills have changed, if at all, in the last 12 months?

How are people management tasks being delegated?
For Australia, Ireland and the UK, supporting people managers is a key
capability area for people professionals, with respondents in the UK most
likely to cite this compared with the other regions. This has been a consistent
priority since 2021. The CIPD’s Effective people managers evidence review
draws on the best available evidence on why people managers are important
for organisational success and how to develop them.
Related to this, proportionately more UK and Ireland respondents said that
their most basic recruitment and people management tasks are delegated
to line managers (in comparison with APAC and MENA respondents) (see
Figure 3). Given the higher proportions of line manager responsibility for
people management tasks, this may explain why supporting line managers
is higher on the agenda for UK and Ireland people teams, to ensure people
management tasks are effectively carried out.

What is the impact of hybrid working on people practice?
When asked whether hybrid working has made people management easier or
more challenging, we found a contrasting picture across the regions.

1

APAC and MENA respondents (with the exception of Singapore) were
significantly more likely to say people practice has become easier due to
hybrid working, compared with those in the UK and Ireland (see Figure 4 on
page 20).

MENA respondents were most likely to report that managing performance,
ensuring good job quality and attracting and recruiting talent is easier
to manage in a hybrid setting. There were also positive perceptions on
communication and cutting costs:

“[Hybrid working makes it] easier to communicate crossborder, easier to motivate people and easier to manage rental
costs.” (KSA survey respondent)
APAC country respondents (with the exception of Singapore) felt that
supporting employee health and wellbeing and attracting and recruiting talent
are easier through hybrid working:

“Hybrid and remote working has made people management
within the organisation easier because this style of working
helps increase productivity, creates a sense of trust, improves
work–life balance and promotes a more efficient use of time.”
(Malaysian survey respondent)

“Increased flexibility in scheduling and working arrangements
can help accommodate employees’ needs and preferences.”
(Malaysian survey respondent)
However, some comments from APAC respondents highlighted the difficulties
around building culture across a dispersed and remote workforce:

“Driving culture when employees are remote is harder;
building a sense of belonging when employees are remote is
harder.” (Hong Kong survey respondent)
“Building culture in the organisation is harder when there’s
rarely more than a third of the workforce in the office on any
given day.” (Australian survey respondent)

Question: We are now going to ask you about some aspects of working as an HR/people professional. Please indicate how, if at all,
these have changed due to the shift towards, ‘working from anywhere’, and hybrid working.

In contrast, UK and Ireland respondents – and also those in Singapore –
were significantly more likely to say that all areas of people management are
more challenging within a hybrid context. The most difficult areas included
supporting employee health and wellbeing, building organisational culture,
attracting, recruiting and retaining talent, and managing performance. An HR
practitioner in the UK noted:

“The shift to hybrid work has impacted our organisational
culture in unforeseen ways. The challenge lies in nurturing a
cohesive culture that transcends physical boundaries. Efforts
to foster a shared sense of purpose and identity among
remote and onsite employees require creative approaches and
proactive communication.” (UK survey respondent)
Given that measuring performance is a key workforce priority area identified
earlier in this report, it’s interesting to consider the perceived impact of hybrid
working on performance:

“The hybrid work setup has necessitated a shift in our
performance management strategies. We’re collaborating
closely with managers to establish clear goals and
expectations for employees working in diverse environments.
Regular check-ins, transparent feedback mechanisms, and
data-driven evaluations are pivotal in ensuring consistent
performance across the hybrid model.” (UK HR practitioner)
Differences within each region are explored in more detail within the
respective accompanying reports.

Spotlight focus: How are people professionals using
evidence in practice?
When making decisions, it is important to use as many sources
of evidence as possible to inform your thinking. Our article
Building an evidence-based people profession explores the
importance of evidence-based practice and why practitioners should use
the best available evidence in the chosen area, rather than relying on fads,
outdated insights or so-called ‘best practice’. Taking an evidence-based
approach to decision-making not only helps people professionals increase
their influence with other business leaders, but also leads to a profession that
is more respected and trusted, thanks to its strong body of knowledge.
Unfortunately, evidence-based practice is in its relative infancy in HR and
management, especially compared with professions like medicine and
education, where it is more established.
Attitudes towards using research to inform practice
Well over half of our survey respondents believe that scientific research is an
important way to improve practice across the profession, with proportionately
higher agreement in APAC countries (62%). Respondents who agreed that
research is important to improve practice are also more likely to actively
engage with research summaries (68%) and published research (69%) on a
frequent basis (once a week or more) than those who disagreed (9% and
10% respectively). One of the core values in the CIPD Profession Map is to be
evidence-based, and we found that CIPD members were more likely to agree
that research is an important way to improve practice within the profession
than non-members (64%, versus 53%).
Of those who disagreed that research improves practice, 28% engage with
research summaries and 30% engage with published research regularly,
showing that a sizeable proportion of these still actively use research to
support their decision-making. On the whole, this suggests that people
professionals recognise the importance of being evidence-based, and of
drawing on research to support and improve HR practice.

Barriers to engaging with research
Despite recognising the importance of research to inform practice, on average
40% of respondents felt they are too time-poor to keep abreast of the latest
research. This was somewhat less for MENA respondents (31%).
In terms of accessibility, 42% of the global sample believe that published
research is too complex and technical, and this is higher for regions where
English is not necessarily the respondent’s first language (45% in MENA
countries and 52% in APAC countries). This has led the CIPD to produce
accessible evidence reviews and bitesize research summaries.
Types of evidence used to inform decision-making
There are several types of evidence that can be used to inform decisionmaking, with some used more frequently than others. Figure 5 shows several
evidence sources and how often our respondents use them in practice.

source than published research

Question: How often do you actively use the following to inform your decisions as an HR/people professional?
(Please select one on each row.)

Globally, we find that practitioners are far more likely to rely on personal
experience than on published or summarised research. For example, only a
quarter of our global sample said they actively engage with published research
on a weekly basis, compared with 63% who use personal experience. However,
looking beyond the active users, more than three-quarters of respondents said
they engage with published research at some point over the year.
A minority said they have never engaged with published research (16%) and
people data (9%) to inform their professional decision-making. Generalist HR
professionals were more likely to say they have never engaged with research
summaries (17%) or published research (18%) than the majority of the sample.
When we consider HR specialisms, recruitment and resourcing professionals
and reward and benefit specialists had engaged with research the least,
compared with the other specialist roles.

At a regional level, we find that active engagement levels (ie engaging once a
week or more frequently) vary significantly across regions. MENA respondents
were considerably more consistent with how they engage with the various
sources, although they were still least likely to engage with published research
(out of the five sources).
Usage among UK and Ireland respondents varied considerably. While 72%
said they regularly use personal experience to inform their decision-making,
only a fifth said they regularly engage with research summaries and published
research on a weekly basis (see Figure 6).

Spotlight focus: What is HR’s role in the sustainability
agenda?
According to a United Nations report, humans have been the
main driver of climate change since 1800,9 which has resulted
in serious calls to action for all countries to help combat climate
change and slow its negative impact on our planet. The shared responsibility
of taking action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions has led to 130 countries
committing to net zero.10 As well as this intergovernmental and legally binding
pledge, there is growing momentum for organisations to tackle climate action,
23

reflected in the increasing number of environmental, social and governance
(ESG) committees in large UK organisations (CIPD, 2023) and the rise in chief
sustainability officer roles.
The transition to net zero is a defining trend that people professionals need
to influence and lead on, especially given the importance of educating and
upskilling the labour market. The CIPD report Putting people professionals
on the road to net zero gives recommendations to policy-makers in the UK
and people professionals everywhere on how to start their environmental
sustainability journey.
The prevalence of environmental sustainability strategies
Across the global sample, an average of 59% said their organisation has a
strategy for sustainability and environmental issues, with Australia (71%),
Hong Kong (65%) and UAE (64%) most likely to say this. Singapore and
Ireland respondents were least likely to have a sustainability strategy in place
(see Figure 7).
Across the global sample, we found that large businesses (with 250+
employees) were more likely to have a strategy for sustainability and
environmental issues (69%, compared with 52% of SMEs). We also found that
public sector organisations were slightly more likely to have a strategy in place
(63%), compared with private (58%) and voluntary (60%) sector businesses.

The role of people professionals in sustainability strategies
We found that in KSA, Australia and Malaysia, the HR function is consistently
involved in the sustainability agenda, from developing the sustainability
strategy to communicating and implementing it (see Figure 8). In Egypt,
UAE, Singapore, Ireland and the UK, HR is less likely to be involved in
developing the strategy compared with their involvement in communicating
and implementing the strategy in practice. Overall, the UK was significantly
less likely to have HR teams involved at all stages of sustainability strategy
planning compared with the wider sample, despite more than a third of UK
businesses having a chief sustainability officer in post. Comparatively, the UK
and Ireland appear to be lagging behind when it comes to HR representation
in the sustainability agenda.
Across the global sample, we found that people teams from SMEs are
significantly more likely to be very/fairly involved in the development (76%),
communication (80%) and implementation (77%) of strategies compared with
larger organisations (57%, 65% and 65% respectively). Looking across sectors,
people professionals from public sector organisations were significantly less
likely to be involved in this strategic agenda.

5 Conclusion

This international report compares how various regions are being impacted
by current workplace trends and how the people profession is responding and
adapting people practice in line with local workforce priorities.
Here are some key reflections for people professionals:
1. Practitioners need to prioritise their learning and development to stay
ahead of the curve.
The world of work is evolving at a rapid pace and the impact of technology
and digital transformation on organisations, people teams and people
professionals themselves will require practitioners to commit to continuous
learning to build their skills and capabilities effectively. Our data suggests
that the role of people professionals is being influenced not only by
technology, but also by other external disruptors, diversifying workforce
expectations and ongoing internal change. However, efforts to upskill vary
considerably across the sample and we can’t afford for skills growth to stall.
At a team level, it is critical that people professionals build their capability
to work cross-functionally and increase their visibility by partnering
with other business areas, so that they closely align people strategy with
business objectives.
2. Understanding the impact of hybrid working is critical for people
management.
Perceptions in some regions are that hybrid working has made people
practice easier to deliver, but for others, it has surfaced challenges,
particularly around supporting employee wellbeing, building culture,
and attracting and retaining talent. Our data suggests that the impact of
hybrid working is complex, particularly for organisations who operate
across regions. Given that the demand for hybrid working is likely to
remain higher than pre-pandemic levels, it’s important that we take stock,
understand the potential risks by collecting data and consulting with
employees, and adapt strategies and practice accordingly to minimise
business and people risks.
3. Practitioners should aspire to be more evidence-based in their
decision-making.
Our data suggests that many professionals recognise the importance of
using research to inform practice. However, there is still some way to
go. While many practitioners use professional experience to help inform
decision-making, they shouldn’t rely on this alone. But our findings suggest

26

Conclusion

2

3
4
5

7

People Profession 2023: International survey report

that there are barriers, such as lack of time and the complexity of using
other sources of evidence. Professionals need to hone their critical thinking
skills and be more confident when appraising research and data to drive
their evidence-based decision-making forward.
4. People teams can play a pivotal role in driving environmental
sustainability strategies.
With inter-governmental efforts to reach net zero targets being a defining
trend over the next decade, there is an opportunity for practitioners to
lead this people-focused agenda, by upskilling, educating and encouraging
sustainable behaviours within the workplace. Currently, our research
suggests that the involvement of people teams varies across the international
sample, but it provides a baseline as we progress towards implementing
more sustainable practices within the workplace. People professionals
should assess whether they can do more to help their organisations develop,
communicate and implement their sustainability strategies.
Our accompanying Asia-Pacific, Middle East and North Africa, UK and Ireland,
and Canada reports take a deeper dive into how these trends – and others –
are affecting individual regions and provide recommendations on how people
professionals can manage the challenges they are facing.

6 Methodology

The People Profession survey is a long-standing research programme that
showcases the current views of people professionals’ working lives and
careers. This survey has developed into an international snapshot of the
profession and provides the latest insights on people practices across the
globe. Our sample included CIPD members and non-members, and is a
mix of in-house and independent professionals from a range of specialisms
(including HR, learning and development (L&D), organisational development
(OD) and others). Full demographic details of our sample can be found at the
end of each of our acccompanying regional reports.

Survey instrument and method
Since 2018, the survey has been tested and refined, and what was originally
a UK-based survey has become an international survey instrument that has
now been piloted in over 14 countries through CIPD-led research, and in 20
countries alongside our research partners: the WFPMA, SHRM and AHRI.
This year, our data collection spans nine countries: Australia, Egypt, Hong
Kong, Ireland, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, Malaysia, Singapore, the United
Arab Emirates and the United Kingdom, with additional data from Canada,
collected by the Chartered Professionals in Human Resources Canada (CPHR
Canada). The findings are presented here in an international report that
explores the collective sample, making comparisons across regions. This is
accompanied by four regional reports (Asia-Pacific (APAC), the Middle East
and North Africa (MENA), the UK and Ireland, and Canada), which draw on
in-region comparisons.

Commissioned by the CIPD, the data was collected by YouGov between
18 April and 27 May 2023 via an online survey. The survey was translated
into the official language of each country to ensure the questions
were accessible and correctly interpreted within each region. The data
analysis was conducted by the CIPD. We surveyed a total of 2,957 people
professionals; the sample sizes for each region are shown in Table 3.
The data is unweighted and therefore the sample of respondents is not
representative of the total HR population within those regions. However,
this data represents the perspectives of the 2,957 people professionals who
participated in this survey.

Survey questions
Each year, the survey instrument is reviewed and refined where changes
are appropriate, or where there are new research questions to be explored.
For the 2023 survey, we added new questions that explore attitudes and
behaviours around applying evidence and research in practice and people
teams’ involvement in their organisation’s sustainability agenda.
Where sample sizes are large enough, the data was cross-tabulated by business
size and sector. We also explore other demographic variables such as age and
experience within the profession throughout the reports, where significant
differences are noted. Given the larger UK sample in comparison with other
regions, the global average percentages will be skewed towards the UK findings.
