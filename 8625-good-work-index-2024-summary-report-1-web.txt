1 Introduction

In 2024, the UK labour market has continued to demonstrate resilience despite
challenges related to increased living costs and ongoing geopolitical tensions.
Levels of employment remain relatively high, as do unfilled vacancies.
Nevertheless, concerns over productivity and the quality of jobs remain as
acute as ever. While most people benefit from engaging, meaningful work,
there are still large majorities who feel disillusioned with their contribution
to their organisations and regard a job as little more than a pay cheque. The
responsibility for employers to support their people remains paramount.
The CIPD Good Work Index (now in its seventh year) is an annual benchmark
of good work, or job quality, in the UK. It measures different aspects of job
quality, including employment essentials, such as contractual arrangements,
the day-to-day realities of work as experienced by workers themselves, and
the impacts on people’s health and wellbeing.

This report is an abridged version of the CIPD Good Work Index 2024 survey
report and distils the key findings in summary form. This report also provides
clear, practical guidance for employers, people professionals and people
managers to take forward in their organisations and to improve job quality
among their staff.
Last year’s Good Work Index reports focused on the high levels of industrial
disputes, mostly in the public sector, where employees showed particular
dissatisfaction with both pay- and non-pay-related workplace issues. It
also highlighted the limited role work plays in many people’s lives, and
the subsequent risk of a slow slide away from enriched work and towards
mediocre jobs.
This year’s key area of focus is interpersonal conflict. While the frequency of
conflict has broadly weakened since the Good Work Index began, it remains
particularly damaging for certain groups in the workplace. The report explores
the impact of conflict on organisational outcomes and how it is resolved. As
well as conflict, this report shares insights from more than 5,000 UK workers’
responses and provides recommendations for practice on key issues, such as:
• designing jobs to create meaningful, engaging work for employees who
may feel a lack of attachment to their work
• providing employees with emotional resilience to cope with challenging job
demands
• reducing skills mismatches and improving opportunities for skills
development
• using work autonomy as a buffer against the risks of digital and
homeworking
• retaining an engaged workforce and attracting a diverse pool of potential
new employees.

Introduction

CIPD Good Work Index 2024: Summary report

2 What is good work?
At the CIPD, we believe that good work:

• is fairly rewarded and gives people the means to securely make a living
• allows for work–life balance
• gives opportunities to develop, and ideally a sense of fulfilment
• provides a supportive environment with constructive relationships
• gives employees the voice and choice they need to shape their working lives
• is physically and mentally healthy for people.
Importantly, good work should be accessible for all, regardless of job type
or someone’s background. It may not be realistic to make all jobs great in all
ways, but employers should ensure that they are thinking creatively about
how they can improve job quality with job design and HR practices.
The seven dimensions of job quality1 cover important subjective and objective
aspects of work. Despite changes in the world of work, the fundamentals of
good work remain constant. People professionals need to focus on getting the
basics right, as well as tackling emerging issues that shift how or where work
is done.
About the CIPD Good Work Index
The data in this summary report comes from the CIPD/YouGov UK Working
Lives survey. This report is based on data from 5,496 UK workers, collected
between 8 January and 15 February 2024. The figures are weighted and
representative of UK working adults. We also refer to longitudinal data from
previous years of the CIPD Good Work Index.
You can find further information about the CIPD Good Work Index below:
• The CIPD Good Work Index 2024 survey report, written by Ian Brinkley,
explores the data in more detail.
• Our archive of CIPD Good Work Index reports since 2018 includes data from
previous years and details on how the survey was developed (please note,
as the report was formerly known as UK Working Lives, the 2018 and 2019
report titles reflect this).
• The CIPD reports Understanding and measuring job quality and The road to
good work informed the development of the Good Work Index.

CIPD Good Work Index 2024: Summary report

3 What does good work look
like in 2024?

This year, employee experiences of conflict emerged as the central focus of
analysis. This covers the most commonly reported incidents of conflict: being
shouted at, undermined or humiliated, and verbally abused. Also included
are false allegations, discrimination related to a protected characteristic and
harassment, all of which are less frequently reported. Serious incidents, such
as sexual and physical assault, remain extremely rare in 2024.
The headline result is positive, with 25% of respondents in 2024 reporting
at least one form of conflict in the last 12 months, down from 30% in 2019.
However, rather than an improvement in workplace relations or conflict
management, this may be attributed to the rise in homeworking since
2019. With staff spending less time in physical proximity with each other,
experiences of conflict have fallen.
Those with protected characteristics are more severely impacted by
interpersonal conflict, which is associated with a number of poor
organisational outcomes, notably lower job satisfaction, poorer mental health
and higher levels of exhaustion. Experiencing conflict is also linked to poorer
perceptions of senior leaders and managers’ roles in encouraging employee
voice, suggesting a lack of an open, honest workplace climate.
Elsewhere, many other indicators of job quality show little change from
previous years. Most people feel satisfied with their job and their pay, and
feel their work provides value for their organisation, but fewer feel inspired
by their own work or by the wider organisational purpose. One key trend
from 2023 continues in 2024, where increasing numbers of workers view
work as transactional – simply for the money. While not a major problem
on its own, combining this trend with other findings does suggest a risk of a
wider issue. With employees less likely to work harder than needed to help
their organisation, and a large minority still feeling the negative effects of
work on their mental and physical health, the slide into mediocre work with
demotivated, uncommitted and unproductive staff cited in last year’s reports
remains a distinct risk.
More positive news comes from the area of skills, training and development,
with staff feeling able to acquire useful skills in their roles and access good
career opportunities. However, many still feel overqualified for their roles.
While the majority of respondents feel they have a strong degree of autonomy
in how they do their work, this has seen no significant change over the last
five years. Contrary to expectations, the rise in homeworking since 2019
has had almost no impact, suggesting that those most likely to have shifted
to homeworking already had the highest level of autonomy in their roles,
irrespective of their location.

CIPD Good Work Index 2024: Summary report

This leads to a more general conclusion. With most indicators of job
quality showing only small changes over the years, it follows that increased
homeworking has had little impact on them, too. Homeworking is
unsurprisingly popular among those who are able to do it and there is unmet
demand from those who do not. But it is not in itself a panacea. Job design,
opportunities to develop and strong workplace relationships are more likely to
support better working lives than geographical location.

4 Conflict

Conflict has emerged as the major focus of this year’s analysis, and we
look to explore the most common forms of interpersonal conflict at work,
who it most strongly impacts, how it is resolved, its effect on organisational
outcomes and how it has changed over time.
A quarter of respondents report experiencing at least one form of conflict
over the last 12 months, the most common of which are being humiliated
or undermined at work, being shouted at or being involved in a heated
argument, or being verbally abused (see Table 1). These are also cited by
employees as causing them or their organisation the greatest consequences.
Experiences of discriminatory behaviour due to a protected characteristic
and false allegations also have a major impact on employees, relative to their
comparative infrequency.

CIPD Good Work Index 2024: Summary report

Employees with protected characteristics are more likely to experience
conflict
Those with protected characteristics are particularly likely to report conflict
at work. Women, ethnic minority employees, those with a disability, those
who identify as non-heterosexual and staff under 35 report more frequent
experiences than men, white employees, non-disabled, heterosexual and
those over 35 (see Figure 1).

Note: ‘Non-heterosexual’ combines survey categories of gay and lesbian, bi-sexual and other because of sample size constraints.
Under 35 combines under 25 and 25–34 age categories for the same reason.

Most incidents of conflict are simply let go
By far the most common response to conflict is to let it go, with nearly
half of our sample choosing to do this over other options, such as having a
discussion with a manager or with HR, or discussing it with family/friends
outside of work (see Figure 2).

CIPD Good Work Index 2024: Summary report

Interpersonal conflict has many negative consequences for employees
Unsurprisingly, experiencing conflict is associated with a number of negative
organisational outcomes. First, those who have experienced conflict are less
likely to be satisfied with their job. They’re also more likely to feel exhausted,
under pressure and struggle with their workload, all of which leads to a
negative impact of work on their mental health (see Table 2).

Conflict is linked to poorer perceptions of senior leaders and managers,
but general relationships remain unaffected
Looking more widely at conflict, interpersonal relationships and perceptions
of others, it follows that those who experience conflict at work may view
senior leadership less favourably, which may play into their decision to simply
let conflict go. Indeed, those with experience of conflict feel much less
confidence in senior leaders, have less trust in their integrity, and are less likely
to perceive them as having a clear vision for the organisation, compared with
those who have not experienced conflict (see Table 3).
Nevertheless, wider relationships do not appear to suffer as a result of
experiencing conflict. Relationships with teammates, colleagues and line
reports remain high among all respondents. It appears that employees
make a distinction between general working relations and specific actions.
For example, although relationships at work are rated highly, those who
experience conflict rate their managers poorly when it comes to treating them
fairly, with respect, supporting them and recognising their achievements,
compared with employees with no experience of conflict.
The association between conflict and lack of voice is more clear, with
employees who experience conflict less positive about their manager’s
ability to seek their views, respond to suggestions, keep them informed,
allow them to influence decisions and their pay, compared with other
colleagues. Alongside the perceptions of senior leaders, this finding suggests
that employees don’t feel confident or comfortable raising an issue with
their superiors because they feel it may have little positive impact, so they
prefer to let it go.

The workplace has become less conflicted
A comparison between 2019 and 2024 throws up a positive finding: reporting
of any conflict has fallen from 30% to 25% (see Table 4). There are only small
differences among groups, but the greatest falls are seen among male, white,
over-35s without a disability in higher socioeconomic groups (ABC1). Nonheterosexual employees have also seen an encouraging drop in conflict, albeit
from a high level in 2019.

The fall in conflict appears to be mostly driven by the rise in homeworking
since 2019, rather than any underlying improvement in workplace behaviour
or climate. This year, the greater the time spent at home, the less likely people
are to report conflict (see Figure 3).

Recommendations for practice
Interpersonal conflict at work is clearly a complex issue that can’t
be solved by one organisational group making one set of decisions
alone. Conflict affects people throughout the organisation and takes
many different forms. Our Bullying and incivility at work evidence
review builds on findings from this report. It finds that workplace
incivility, which can include rude behaviour, undermining, bullying and
harassment, among other things, is linked to higher levels of anxiety,
depression and burnout, and increased absenteeism, presenteeism and
turnover.
While this report shows that the frequency of conflict has decreased
over the years, it is still particularly impactful for certain groups at work.
One thing that’s clear is that there is more to do for senior leaders and
line managers to reduce the potential negative impacts of conflict by
more effectively creating a workplace environment in which employees
feel able to raise their concerns without fear of judgement or being
ignored. This requires work from employers, leaders and people
professionals to not only encourage and demonstrate openness and
honesty, but to provide training for line managers to have difficult
conversations with their people.
Our Trust and psychological safety evidence review provides a
number of recommendations for organisations to improve trust and
psychological safety among employees, increasing their confidence to
take risks and speak up without fear of judgement or ridicule:
• Leaders should aim to strengthen trust and psychological safety
through encouraging people to speak up and be open, and by
demonstrating these behaviours themselves. Using one’s voice should
be embraced and rewarded, rather than punished.
• Managers should pay full attention when team members speak,
showing empathy and understanding. They should avoid interrupting,
jumping to conclusions or passing judgement. They should lead by
example, sharing their own vulnerabilities and concerns with the team.
• Leaders and people professionals should provide line managers with
the skills they need to become an important voice in managing
interpersonal conflict, rather than a sticking point.
• Leaders should ensure policies related to conflict are fair, easy to
understand and available to everyone they may affect, in order to
make employees feel respected and treated with dignity.

5 Job design, work centrality
and meaningful work

This year, we explored a range of quality-of-work indicators which focus on
how people feel about work and their jobs. How jobs are designed is key
to providing employees with meaning and fulfilment within their roles and
ensuring they have the resources to perform.
Lack of work centrality and discretionary effort remain an issue
While most indicators of job quality show very modest change over the last
five years, ‘work centrality’– or how central people feel work is to their life
– has shifted significantly. The trend of more respondents feeling that a job
is just about money and nothing else was highlighted in 2023 and has risen
further in 2024 (as shown in Figure 4). Nearly half of respondents feel this in
2024, compared with just 36% in 2019. This change appears to have shifted
following the COVID-19 pandemic, when work became a lower priority for
many amid uncertainty and upheaval.
Another indication of work playing a less central role in people’s lives is lower
discretionary effort, or willingness to work harder than needed to help one’s
employer or organisation. In 2024, 51% are willing. While this has stayed the
same since 2023, it is lower than the 57% recorded in 2019 and shows no sign
of returning to pre-pandemic levels.

Looking at differences by group, men are more likely than women to view
work as transactional. Unsurprisingly, workers in the C2DE socioeconomic
groups are also more likely than those in ABC1 groups to feel this way, as are
private sector workers, compared with those in the public sector.
Since 2019, the feeling of work as transactional has grown for many different
groups, in particular those under 35, ethnic minority employees and those in
atypical work contracts (see Table 5).

Employees have mixed feelings about their jobs
Perceptions of job tasks are mixed in 2024. Over two-thirds of employees’
roles always or often involve solving unforeseen problems on their own. This
figure could be viewed in a positive or negative light – most staff are afforded
responsibility and autonomy for solving job tasks themselves, but regularly
dealing with unforeseen problems, particularly on their own, may lead to key,
pre-planned job tasks being deprioritised.

Other findings are just as mixed. On one side, nearly half of respondents’ jobs
always or often involve interesting, complex tasks and learning new things,
but, on the other side, the same number face monotonous tasks (see Figure 5).
None of these figures have seen significant changes over the years.

Most employees are engaged at work
Employees in 2024 once again generally feel positively engaged at work, with
half being always or often enthusiastic, immersed in their work and feeling
like time flies (see Table 6). However, just under a third always or often feel
full of energy at work, and nearly the same number never feel this. More
positively, low numbers feel miserable, lonely or bored at work, and while
feelings of excessive pressure and exhaustion are higher, only a quarter of
employees report experiencing this. None of these numbers have shifted
dramatically in recent years, and it’s promising that we’ve seen no downturn,
given the changing landscape of work over the last half-decade. However, yet
more needs to be done to engage and motivate staff.

CIPD Good Work Index 2024: Summary report

Employees have mixed feelings about meaningful work
This year, staff feel positive about gaining meaning through their work, mainly
through their contribution to their organisation. The vast majority of staff feel
their work is important and useful for their employer. More widely, however,
findings are mixed. Under half are inspired by their organisation’s purpose,
and similar numbers of respondents feel they do useful work for society, serve
a greater purpose and make the world a better place through their work.
Nevertheless, for such idealistic questions, these responses are fairly positive.
At a more personal level, two-thirds of employees gain a sense of
achievement at work. Around half feel work aligns with their values, matches
their interests and contributes to personal growth. Again, these are ambitious
questions, so the mixed responses are no surprise. One negative is that
only 41% feel inspired at work – similar to the number inspired by their
organisation’s purpose (see Table 7).

Recommendations for practice
Designing jobs for the benefit of employees is of course hugely
important; a job that is interesting, enjoyable and meaningful to staff
helps them feel engaged and motivated at work, more committed to
their organisation and more closely aligned to the values and goals of
the business. Lower work centrality is in itself not necessarily a problem;
after all, being able to enjoy time away from work and create a healthy
balance between work and home life is vital for employees’ wellbeing.
However, lower attachment to one’s organisation and being less willing
to go the extra mile could pose a risk if we see levels of engagement
and motivation also reduce.

CIPD Good Work Index 2024: Summary report

Our Employee engagement evidence review outlines the impact of
having an engaged and motivated workforce: notably staff who are
more satisfied at work, experience better wellbeing and see improved
performance.
Developing feelings of engagement, commitment and motivation
among employees requires positive behaviour from staff at all levels of
the organisation. Several factors are consistently cited as important:
• Providing employees with the resources to do their job properly, such
as supervisor and colleague support and feedback, helps prevent the
demands of their job from becoming overwhelming.
• Employers should provide their staff with sufficient support to ensure
they feel cared for and valued in their jobs. This is likely to increase
their identification with the organisation and leave them feeling more
engaged and committed.
• Jobs need to be clearly defined so employees have an acute
understanding of their role expectations. They also need to make
full use of their skills and sufficiently challenge them in order to be
meaningful.

6 Workplace wellbeing

The perceived impact of work on people’s health is extremely mixed and
varies among different groups. Thirty-nine per cent of employees feel that
work impacts their mental health positively, with 31% feeling the positive effect
of work on their physical health. In terms of both physical and mental health,
a quarter of employees feel the negative impact of work.

1
2

Focusing on the effect of work on mental health, there are no significant
differences by gender or disability. Where we do begin to notice changes are
by age, with under-25s and over-55s most likely to benefit mentally from
work. Surprisingly, those in atypical contracts report a greater positive impact
on mental health than those in permanent contracts. However, this may be
down to a greater number of young workers having such contract types. As
with many indicators of job quality, public sector workers are worse off here,
with only 31% reporting a positive impact of work on mental health, compared
with 41% of private sector staff (see Figure 6).

5

Looking over time, the changes among these different groups over the last
several years have been modest at best.

permanent contract (n=4,535); public sector (n=852); private sector (n=4,254).

Recommendations for practice
At the CIPD, we believe that work should be physically and mentally
healthy for everyone, if possible. In reality, however, there are always
workplace stressors that inevitably get in the way of achieving that ideal.
We regularly see organisations making changes to how they operate,
and staff are required to adapt to new ways of working alongside their
changing personal lives. We know that during financial hardship, work
pressure can easily increase as the drive to do more with less becomes
even more intense. In 2024, rising costs continue to put this strain on
businesses and those within them.
During such challenging times, the ability of staff to cope with adversity
is paramount. Our Employee resilience evidence review outlines the
importance of showing resilience through turbulent times, and being
able to thrive, not just survive, during uncertainty. Resilient employees
are more likely to be more committed and engaged and are therefore
likely to perform better at work, while being less likely to suffer from
disorders such as anxiety and depression.
People managers – and subsequently senior leaders, HR professionals
and anyone who supports and develops them – have a role in helping
their staff to be resilient. Simply expecting employees to toughen up
and be more resilient isn’t good enough; their behaviour affects an
employee’s resilience. Leaders who set motivating goals, celebrate
success within the team and foster supportive work environments are
likely to benefit from engaged and resilient staff:
• Managers should communicate and manage work and resources in
such a way that people know what to expect and what is expected
of them in their roles, so they can cope with unplanned or adverse
events.

CIPD Good Work Index 2024: Summary report

• Managers can develop self-efficacy among their staff through
smart goal-setting, coaching and shining a light on the success of
employees and their colleagues.
• Senior leaders must shape supportive work environments through
their decisions, communication and role-modelling.
• HR and L&D professionals must be given the backing they need
to effectively equip people managers with the right capabilities to
develop resilience among their people.

7 Employee autonomy

The way jobs are designed also determines the level of autonomy employees
have over ways of working. Employee autonomy is important because it is
consistently linked to important organisational outcomes, such as higher
wellbeing and performance. Management control, on the other hand, is often
seen as stifling autonomy. In reality, however, these two concepts exist on a
spectrum. We sought to explore how these two factors interact under different
circumstances.
As with previous years, employees in 2024 feel relatively positive about their
influence over aspects of their job. Notably, over three-quarters feel they have
a lot or some control over how they do their work, while around two-thirds
feel similarly about the pace at which they work and the tasks they do. Staff
are, however, more mixed about their ability to influence when they start and
end their working day (see Figure 7).

Autonomy is more greatly influenced by type of job, rather than
homeworking
Our evidence shows a clear association between working at home and
increased employee autonomy (see Figure 9). This is no surprise; greater
autonomy is often cited as a key benefit of home and remote working. We
found that how much time employees spend working from home is less
important than giving them the freedom to do so: those who are able to
work from home have more influence than those who aren’t over their
job tasks, how they work, the speed at which they work, and start and end
times, in particular.
However, we should approach these findings with caution, and we suggest
that these differences are down to the types of jobs homeworkers do, rather
than homeworking itself. Levels of reported autonomy among all workers
have shown little change since 2019. Those in ABC1 socioeconomic groups
have driven the increase in homeworking since the COVID-19 pandemic, but
these employees were already regularly working flexibly and remotely.

Recommendations for practice
Employee autonomy is clearly an important aspect that, while
anecdotally enjoyed by a lot of homeworkers, may actually help
protect against some of the potential risks of working digitally. Our
Mental wellbeing and digital work evidence review states that, while
remote working isn’t in itself damaging to people’s wellbeing, it poses a
number of risks to health if not managed sensibly. Notably, the feeling
of needing to be ‘always on’, ‘digitally tethered’ to one’s workstation and
struggling to switch off and gain separation between work and home
life, is an issue of working digitally. Working long hours and creating
excessive job demands is a result of this, so empowering people to
handle these demands is an essential aspect of management. Work
autonomy is one way of doing this:
• Employees need to feel they genuinely have permission to control as
much of their work environment as possible, so creating a manifesto
or template that normalises using autonomy throughout the
organisation can help legitimise this.
• Leaders should set an example by encouraging and demonstrating
flexible working, for example by taking physical breaks during the day.
• Employees should take advantage of digital technology to facilitate
their own autonomy, such as by blocking out time in their calendars
and setting automatic email replies outside of their normal hours.

8 Work–life balance and
flexible working

While not a major area for analysis in 2024, some interesting, positive findings
have emerged on informal flexibility. This year, 70% of employees report
finding it easy to take an hour or two away from work to deal with a personal
or family issue. This figure has been rising slowly since 2019 and has now
peaked (see Figure 10).

Recommendations for practice
As mentioned above, providing staff with autonomy over how they
work is key to ensuring they are not at risk of the potential strains of
working remotely or digitally. This also follows for flexible working
opportunities. Our Flexible working, teleworking and diversity evidence
review illustrates that flexible working arrangements (FWAs) not only
lead to staff feeling more satisfied, but help them reduce any conflict
between competing work and family roles. Nevertheless, simply
providing employees with time outside of work is not enough; only
through allowing them to influence how their time is distributed are the
positive effects of FWAs felt.

Our recent report, Flexible and hybrid working practices in 2023,
encourages employers to make the most of flexible working in several
different ways:

8

• Implement policies that allow staff to request flexible working from
day one of their employment, and share this in job adverts to attract a
wider pool of candidates.

10

11
20

Work–life balance and flexible working

CIPD Good Work Index 2024: Summary report

• Raise awareness of different types of flexible working, like job-sharing
and compressed hours, and explore how they can be implemented in
traditionally non-flexible roles.
• Allow employees to have influence on how flexible and hybrid
working looks in your organisation by collaborating with them to
design new working practices.
• Provide training to managers on how to manage flexible, hybrid and
remote teams effectively.

9 Job security

In 2024, employees feel a fairly high level of job security, which is comparable
with previous years. Two-thirds feel they are unlikely to lose their job in the next
12 months. However, they are more mixed on the perceived ease of finding a
new job at least as good as their current one, with 34% saying it would be easy,
43% saying it would be difficult, and 23% being in between (see Figure 11).
We must interpret the second finding with care. Those most likely to find
getting a new job as good as their current one tend to be older workers in
permanent, long-tenure jobs, while those least likely are younger workers
with shorter tenures. Long-tenure workers may have built up a repertoire of
benefits in their roles, which may be unachievable in a new job, and may fear
rejection due to their age.
There are only small changes in these findings over the years, but they
do suggest modest improvements in job security post-pandemic, perhaps
reflecting increased availability of unfilled vacancies.

CIPD Good Work Index 2024: Summary report

Recommendations for practice
Our Resourcing and talent planning report highlights several ways in
which employers can help create an engaged workforce and retain their
most valuable people, while also making themselves more attractive to
potential new recruits. These practical recommendations should help
organisations recruit and retain against a challenging backdrop, and
help them navigate any future ups and downs of the labour market and
economic outlook:
• Be proactive in widening talent pools by varying recruitment outreach
approaches and channels, and ensure your brand is attractive and
well communicated to a diverse group of candidates.
• Engage and attract candidates throughout the recruitment process
to help them perform once they’re in the role. This means removing
barriers to work when possible by adopting inclusive recruitment
and selection practices, such as flexibility, removing unnecessary
qualification from job adverts, and providing financial support to
those who need it.
• Review not only pay but your overall benefits package, being realistic
about what is positioned as a benefit to most effectively attract recruits.

10 Skills and training

There is still a mismatch of skills and qualifications among employees in 2024,
with around a third of respondents feeling they have the skills to do more than
their job demands, and that their qualifications exceed those required by the job.
While larger numbers of respondents do feel their skills and qualifications are
well matched to their job, these numbers have remained stable since 2019,
suggesting there is still work to be done to provide employees with enough
complexity and challenge at work (see Figure 12).

CIPD Good Work Index 2024: Summary report

Recommendations for practice
Our report, Devolution and evolution in UK skills policy, examines trends
in skills investment and skills use across the four UK nations. It indicates
skills gaps, mismatches and underutilisation as key issues that point to
inefficiencies between the labour market and the skills development
system. Our report, Over-skilled and underused: Investigating
the untapped potential of UK skills, outlines the consequences of
mismatched skills, notably psychological distress, lower job satisfaction
and greater desire to quit their role. On the other hand, when people
are able to use their skills fully, they’re more engaged, have better
relationships with managers and are more likely to want to stay put.
There are several steps employers and managers can take to reduce
skills mismatches and improve development opportunities in the
workplace:
• Conduct a skills audit: knowing and understanding the skills of the
workforce is key to making better use of those skills, particularly in
high-demand areas.
• Rethink recruitment practices: if certain qualifications are irrelevant for
the role in question, remove them from the job criteria.
• Review how jobs are designed and look at team structures to identify
areas where the use of skills can be optimised.

11 Conclusion

The Good Work Index 2024 shows that most employees in the UK continue
to be generally satisfied with their jobs, with little change occurring. However,
such a broad view of job quality could undermine some nuances that are key
to understanding and improving good work.
Notably, we find that conflict in the workplace negatively impacts almost
every aspect of work measured in the UK Working Lives survey. Twenty-five
per cent of our survey – or 8 million people at work in the UK – are affected
by some form of interpersonal conflict at work. To improve work quality, we
must tackle conflict, particularly for those with protected characteristics, who
are more severely affected by conflict and have seen little improvement over
the last five years.
The role of line managers and the people function is key, as it is at the
workplace level that most conflicts arise, where the impacts are felt, and
where resolution takes place. Thankfully, few incidents of conflict escalate to
formal grievances or industrial tribunals.
Nevertheless, there is a clear feeling that conflict is often let go because
employees feel their voice is not encouraged, it will have little impact or they

Conclusion

CIPD Good Work Index 2024: Summary report

will not be listened to by leaders. There is a clear need for an organisational
shift, whereby an environment in which openness is encouraged and rolemodelled by senior leaders is developed. This also requires investment in line
management training to better understand conflict and feel empowered to
deal with it more effectively.
There is a great deal of positive practice to build on in 2024 – many
employees feel engaged in their jobs and enjoy the benefits of flexible
working and work autonomy. And, while skills mismatches are still present,
people continue to feel more positive about their opportunities to develop
and progress at work.
However, we still see that there has been limited progress on raising job
quality since the UK Government’s Good Work Plan was established in 2018,
with large minorities of people continuing to experience negative effects
of work. Continuing to measure and analyse job quality is vital, not only
to benefit the lives of employees, but to support efforts to boost labour
participation and help address skill and labour shortages, making good work
more accessible to everyone.
