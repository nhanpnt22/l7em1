CIPD Good Work Index 2024: Survey report

1 Introduction

The CIPD Good Work Index is an annual benchmark of good work or job
quality in the UK. It measures a wide range of aspects of job quality, including
employment essentials, such as contractual arrangements, the day-to-day
realities of work as experienced by workers themselves, and the impacts on
their health and wellbeing.
The 2024 survey was conducted as the labour market continued to
demonstrate resilience despite some recent weakening. Unemployment
remained low and the level of unfilled vacancies remained high. The rapid fall
in inflation had allowed some recovery in real wages. However, concerns over
labour supply and low productivity remained as acute as ever.
Last year’s report was conducted during high levels of industrial disputes,
mostly in the public sector. The first two months of 2024 for which statistics
are available show much reduced activity. There appears to have been no
great increase in cases going to employment tribunal.1 However, neither
measure is a good indicator of underlying conflict in the workplace at the
individual level. The CIPD’s 2024 survey helps fill that gap.
2024 at a glance
The central focus of this report is conflict in the workplace, also a core theme
from our 2019 survey. Conflict in our context covers being undermined or
humiliated at work, verbal abuse, false allegations, discrimination related to a
protected characteristic (sex, race, disability, sexuality), intimidation, assault,
and harassment.
The most commonly reported conflicts were being shouted at, undermined
or humiliated, or being verbally abused. About 5% of people reported
discrimination. Serious incidents, such as sexual and physical assault, were rare.
The headline result is good news. Conflict has fallen, from 30% reporting
at least one form of conflict in 2019 to 25% in 2024. However, this may be
attributed to the big rise in homeworking since 2019, rather than to underlying
improvement. The decline in conflict is mostly driven by falls in incidents
of being shouted at or verbally abused, which are linked to people being in
physical proximity.
The largest falls in conflict were for white men over 35 in the ABC
socioeconomic group (see Box 1 for details) and permanent jobs (these groups
also account for most of the rise in homeworking). Non-heterosexual workers
also reported higher than average declines – but from an exceptionally high
level – and reported conflict still remains well above the average.

CIPD Good Work Index 2024: Survey report

Box 1: Survey definitions
The survey uses some condensed categories to help summarise results
and we have combined some categories to give an adequate sample.
These include:
ABC1 and C2DE socioeconomic groups: ABC1 is mostly those in
higher-skill, white-collar managerial, professional and technical jobs.
C2DE includes those in skilled manual and less skilled manual and nonmanual jobs.
Non-heterosexual workers: This group combines the three survey
categories of gay and lesbian, bisexual and other sexuality to ensure an
adequate sample size.
Atypical contracts: This group combines three survey categories of
temporary workers, zero-hours workers, and short-hours workers to
ensure an adequate sample size. Note that some of these jobs are also
permanent.
Age: In this analysis we have typically combined the two youngest age
groups (all those under 35) to ensure a reasonable sample, especially
for comparisons with the 2019 survey, where those under 25 were
underrepresented.
Ethnic minorities, women, the disabled, those under 35, those with ‘atypical’
job contracts, and those in the C2DE socioeconomic group were more likely
to report conflict in 2024 and, for them, little has changed since 2019.
A big focus of public debate for many policy-makers and practitioners is
on formal processes to resolve conflict, such as grievances, mediation or
industrial tribunals, but very few workplace conflicts are escalated to this level.
Discussions with HR and line managers have a role, but the most common
way people dealt with conflict was to let it go. It is unrealistic to think every
conflict can be resolved fully, and most people reported either full or partial
resolution – but one-third had no resolution.
People who reported conflict had lower job and pay satisfaction and were
more likely to say they experienced excessive workload, pressure, exhaustion,
and negative impacts on their mental and physical health than those who
did not. They also gave more negative responses on voice in the workplace.
Unsurprisingly, they were twice as likely to say they may quit their job as
those who did not report conflict.
The impact of conflict on general relations in the workplace was surprisingly
modest. People who reported conflict were less likely to report good relations
with managers, but they were a minority. Most people who reported conflict
also reported good relations in the workplace. And conflict had no significant
impact on relations with colleagues or how managers perceived their relations
with staff.

CIPD Good Work Index 2024: Survey report

This may be because people are making nuanced judgements about working
relations in general and specific actions and incidents. Those who reported
conflict were more critical of their managers and teams when specific
behaviours were mentioned. It might also imply many of these incidents were
one-offs where people were prepared to let it go, rather than systemic abuse,
but this interpretation would require further work to confirm.
The impact on performance was ambiguous. Given all the negatives
associated with conflict reported above, it is hard to see how workers who
are disproportionately disaffected about their job and pay, overloaded,
and exhausted at work are going to perform at their best. Conflict is likely
to generate higher turnover rates. But we also found little impact on
discretionary effort – most people in conflict said they would still work harder
than they needed to help their employer and their colleagues and make
innovative suggestions in their teams.
The 2024 survey confirms a previous trend, which started in the pandemic,
where increasing numbers say they think a job is just about the money –
up from 38% in 2019 to 47% in 2024. People were also less likely to say they
would work harder than they need to help their employer, down from 57% to
51%. Neither trend is helpful in terms of improving workforce productivity.
There is somewhat better news on skills, training, and development, with
an increasing proportion of people saying they had opportunities to acquire
skills and good career opportunities. But there was no progress in matching
skills and qualifications to jobs – many said they felt overqualified and
had the skills to do more. We also found very little training specifically on
new technologies, such as AI and virtual reality (VR), despite their growing
application in the workplace.
Many other indicators show little change from either last year or from 2019.
Most people have a positive experience from work with high rates of job
satisfaction. Most think their work is valuable and useful for their organisation,
but fewer feel inspired by the organisation or their work. They were also less
likely to think their work is useful and valuable to society or serves a wider
purpose, but this is a tough hurdle for many jobs to pass.
We also found no significant change in the degree of autonomy people have
in their jobs when looking at tasks, pace, how work is done, and start and
finish times. Although one perceived benefit of homeworking is more control
over work, the rise in homeworking since 2019 has had almost no impact.
This may be because those most likely to work from home were also the most
likely to have jobs with high autonomy, regardless of where they do them.
This in turn leads us to a more general conclusion. If most indicators of
work quality have not greatly changed since 2019, it must follow that
the big increase in homeworking has had little impact on them as well.
Homeworking is popular with those who do it and there is some unmet
demand from those who do not. But it is not a panacea. The sort of job
we do, how we do it, and the way we are treated are all likely to be more
important than geographical location.

Finally, we should note that the proportion who say work is having a negative
impact on their mental and physical health has not changed significantly
either, nor have indicators such as excessive workload, pressure, or exhaustion.
Many of these are too high, but we suggest that work is not the primary driver
of the rise in inactivity caused by long-term sickness since 2019.

Box 2: What is good work?
Definition
The CIPD believes that good work is fundamental to individual
wellbeing, supports a strong, fair society, and creates motivated workers,
productive organisations and a strong economy.
We define ‘good work’ as work that:
• is fairly rewarded
• gives people the means to securely make a living
• provides opportunities to develop skills and a career and gives a
sense of fulfilment
• delivers a supportive environment with constructive relationships
• allows for work–life balance
• is physically and mentally healthy for people
• gives people the voice and choice they need to shape their working
lives
• is accessible to all
• is affected by a range of factors, including HR practices, the quality
of people management and by workers themselves.
Seven dimensions of good work
Our definition of ‘good work’ is based on seven dimensions of good
work that we capture data on. This data forms the basis for the CIPD
Good Work Index itself, which uses both objective and subjective
measures.
Objective measures capture aspects that, in principle, should be
unbiased: for example, data on contract type and union membership.
Subjective measures reflect an opinion, preference or feeling: for example,
how meaningful people find their work, the quality of relationships at
work, and measures of job or life satisfaction.
Our seven dimensions of good work are as set out in Table 1.

The following section sets out some of the main findings from the 2024
survey. We have also compared this with previous surveys from 2019 onwards.
Most indicators show little or very modest change over the period.

One of the big exceptions has been a measure of ‘work centrality’, where
respondents were asked whether a job to them is just about the money and
nothing else. This was a trend we highlighted in last year’s report and this year
saw a further rise. In 2024, 47% agreed, compared with just 36% in 2019. The
turning point seems to have been the pandemic.

Work centrality and discretionary effort

A further question asked about discretionary effort, measured by people’s
willingness to work harder than they needed to help their employer or
organisation. This has declined from pre-pandemic levels. In 2019, 57% said
they would be willing to work harder than they had to and, in 2024, this was
down to 51%. Recent surveys suggest it has stabilised at this lower level. If
things are not getting worse, they are also showing no sign of returning to
pre-pandemic levels.

Willing to work harder

Base: all (n=5,482).

In 2024, men were more likely to agree that a job is just about the money
than women. There was little variation by age, except for the oldest group
of 55 or over, where only 35% agreed a job is just about the money. Workers
in the C2DE socioeconomic groups were more likely to agree than those in
ABC1 groups. Private sector workers were more likely to agree (49%) than the
public sector (42%) or the voluntary sector (37%).
Since 2019, there has been an exceptionally large increase for three groups –
those under 35, those in atypical employment contracts, and ethnic minorities.
The first two are related, as the young are disproportionately likely to be in
atypical work. However, as the 2019 survey underrepresented younger age
groups and atypical work, some of these results should be read with caution.
In contrast, there was below-average change for those 55 or over, those in
socioeconomic group C2DE, and the disabled.

n=4,222; 2024: n=4,615).

Working at home and work centrality
The 2024 survey suggests that those who worked at home were less likely to
say a job is just about the money than those who did no work at home (43%
v 52%). Those who worked at home were also more likely to say they are
willing to work harder than they need to help their employer or organisation
(55%) than those who did not (47%). So the 2024 survey does not suggest an
obvious association between working at home and less commitment to work
as measured by these questions.
It is still possible that the rise in homeworking is associated with an
increase in lower work commitment. We cannot directly test this because
of differences in the questions asked in the two surveys. There is some
indirect association. As Table 2 shows, it is among the ABC1 group that we
see bigger than average increases in the share who say work is just about
the money, and it is the ABC1 group who also account for almost all the
increase in working at home since 2019.

Work centrality and discretionary effort

CIPD Good Work Index 2024: Survey report

However, as we show later, the increase in working at home had no impact
on many other work quality measures, such as autonomy, suggesting it is the
nature of the job and how we are treated at work which are more important
drivers than where we work. Any link to homeworking and the rise in those
saying a job is just about the money must be regarded as not proven for the
time being.
Many would enjoy a job even if they did not need the money
Work centrality is, however, a complex issue. Although nearly 40% agreed a
job is just about the money, even more (57%) agreed they would enjoy their
job even if they did not need the cash.
In 2024, women were somewhat more likely to agree this is the case than
men (younger age groups were much more likely to agree, as were ethnic
minority workers). Those in ‘atypical contracts’ were slightly more likely to
agree than those in permanent work. But there was no difference by disability
or socioeconomic group (58% for ABC1, 57% for C2DE). The proportion of
people in work who hold this view has been remarkably stable across all
groups since 2019.
We might say that work today is becoming more polarised between those
who see it just as a means of income and those who value it for the
enjoyment it brings. This seems to be especially so for younger as well as
ethnic minority workers. Both groups saw exceptionally large increases in the
proportion who said a job is just for money, but both were also consistently
more likely than other groups to say they would enjoy a job even if they did
not need the cash.

3 Job satisfaction and pay

In 2024, most people said they were satisfied with their job (70%) and only
13% said they were dissatisfied. There were no significant differences by
gender or ethnicity (or between the public, private and voluntary sectors).
Younger age groups were slightly more satisfied than older age groups (73%
for those under 35 and 69% for those over 35). In contrast, the disabled were
significantly less satisfied than the non-disabled. So too were those in less
skilled work (socioeconomic group C2DE) compared with higher-skill, whitecollar jobs (socioeconomic group ABC1). This was also the case for those in
atypical contracts.

contract (n=253); permanent contract (n=4,622); all in work (n=5,489).

Pay match with responsibilities
The survey also asked whether people thought they were paid appropriately
for the responsibilities they had – 51% agreed while 30% disagreed. The
proportion in agreement has edged up since last year and is noticeably up
from 45% in 2019. The rise was almost entirely driven by the private sector
(52% in 2024).
In comparison, the voluntary sector was slightly less likely to agree (50%) and
the public sector least so (46%). There were relatively minor differences by
gender, ethnicity, age, and socioeconomic group. Employees with disabilities
were less likely to agree, at 44%, compared with those without disabilities (52%).
This may feel a little counterintuitive given the pressures on real pay in recent
years and increased incidences of industrial action. However, the question
asks people to judge pay against responsibilities and not, for example, whether
pay has kept pace with prices in general. In that sense, we can say there has
been modest progress in aligning pay and responsibilities in the private sector
and very little, if any, in the public sector.

4 Impact of work on mental
and physical health

Some 39% said work had a positive impact on their mental health and 31%
said it had a positive impact on physical health. But a quarter of the workforce
reported negative physical and mental health impacts from work.
For mental health, there were no significant differences by gender or disability.
Those most likely to report positive impacts were at opposite ends of the age
spectrum: the under-25s at 56% and those over 55 at 45%. Rather surprisingly,
those in atypical contracts were much more likely to report positive impacts
on mental health (53%) than those on permanent contracts (36%). This may,
however, be partly explained by the young being more likely to have an
atypical contract.
There were also significant differences by sector: only 31% of public sector
workers reported a positive impact on mental health, compared with 41% of
private and voluntary sector workers. Conversely, 32% of public sector workers
reported a negative impact on mental health, compared with 24% of private
sector workers.
There has been no significant change since 2019 for most of these groups,
though the share of under-35s reporting positive impacts of work on mental
health has edged up to 43% in 2024, from 37% in 2019.
The UK Government has recently launched a consultation over the increased
incidence of inactive claimants of working age due to long-term sickness and
a rapid rise in the welfare payments for those unable to work due to mental
and physical illness and disability. We draw two broad conclusions from the
survey that may be relevant.
First, there has been no increase in the negative impact of work on either
mental or physical health since 2019. The survey does not tell us whether
the severity of that impact has increased over time, but it does not suggest
that work is making people sicker than it was before the pandemic. Other
indicators that might be related, such as the proportion reporting excessive
workload, being under pressure or feeing exhausted at work, have not
significantly changed. Nor, as we report later, can it have been caused by any
increase in workplace conflict.
Second, while it is true that work on average seems to be better for us than
involuntary inactivity, it does not follow that all jobs have a positive impact
on health and wellbeing, with 25% reporting adverse impacts, rising to 30%
for those with a disability. It is not just a job that matters, but the quality of
that work.

5 Engagement and meaning
How I feel about my job
The survey also looked in detail at some positive and negative aspects of
the job. About half of all respondents said that they are always or often
enthusiastic, that time flies or they are immersed in their work. Relatively few
said they rarely or never experienced these things. However, only 30% said
they are always or often full of energy, and 26% said it is rare or never.

The negative aspects were a mixed picture. Most people reported they are
rarely or never lonely, miserable, or bored. But they were less positive when it
came to being full of energy, under pressure or feeling exhausted.
Indeed, between a fifth and a quarter reported they rarely or never feel full of
energy and always or often suffer from excessive pressure, feel exhausted at
work or have an excessive workload. None of these indicators have changed
significantly since 2019.

Meaningful work
Much has been written about whether people think their jobs contribute to
an organisation or have a broader impact on society and the wider world.
Overall, the large majority feel they do valuable work at the organisational
level, but much fewer feel inspired by the organisation’s purpose. Around half
think it serves a wider societal purpose and a quarter do not, but these are
high bars that would be unrealistic to expect all jobs to meet.
In terms of what people get out of their work, two-thirds agreed they get a
sense of achievement. Just over half agreed that their work fits what they
value in life, matches their interests, and contributes to their personal growth.
However, only 41% said they feel inspired at work. Table 4 gives the details.
Responses are very similar to previous years.

6 Task complexity and
work–life balance

Job tasks
Most jobs are a mix of tasks, some monotonous, some interesting, and allow
for learning new things. Most people said their work always or often involves
solving unforeseen problems on their own. Other job features were more
mixed, with just under half saying their job always or often involves complex
or interesting tasks or provides opportunities for learning new things. In
contrast, just under a fifth said their job rarely or never involves such tasks.
However, nearly half said that their job involves monotonous tasks most or all
of the time. It is hard to design a job that does not include some monotonous

Outside commitments and flexibility
Over half said work did not affect their outside commitments (56%), with
about a quarter (24%) disagreeing. In contrast, few people felt outside
commitments make it harder to do their jobs properly and 77% said they
don’t. There has been little change in these indicators since 2019.
There was also considerable informal flexibility around people being able to
take an hour or two off work to deal with a personal or family issue, with most
people saying it would be easy to do so. Since 2019, there has been some
improvement, with the proportion saying it would be easy increasing from
64% to 70%, and the those saying it is hard falling from 22% to 17% (Figure 6).

7 Job security

The survey asks two questions that are widely used in surveys to measure
job security. The first asked people how likely they are to lose their job
in the next six months. In 2024, 13% said it was likely and 65% said it was
unlikely. The second asks how easy it would be to get another job with
similar terms and conditions. To this, 34% said it would be easy, but 43%
said it would be difficult.
However, the second question has to be interpreted with care. Those most
likely to say it would be difficult to get a job as good as the one they currently
have were older workers in permanent, long-tenure jobs, and the least likely
were younger workers with shorter tenures. For example, 34% of those with
tenures of up to two years said it would be difficult to find a new job as good,
compared with 53% of those with tenures of 10 years or more.
The greater pessimism among longer-tenure workers is likely because many
will have built up benefits, such as access to final salary pension schemes,
which would be hard to match with a new employer. Some older workers may
be concerned that they will suffer age discrimination. Some who have built up
skills and experience specific to a company or sector may think they will not
be easily transferable to new opportunities elsewhere in the labour market.
Both measures showed a peak during the pandemic in 2021, but recovered
quickly. The proportion saying they were unlikely to lose their job has
increased somewhat from pre-pandemic levels, from 61% in 2019 to 65%
in 2024. The proportion saying it would be easy to get a similar job has
increased post-pandemic, from 29% in 2019 to 34%. Overall, these indicators
suggest modest improvements in job security post-pandemic, perhaps
reflecting increased availability of unfilled vacancies.

Quitting
The UK labour market is dynamic, with large numbers of people moving
each year between different jobs and industries, mostly on a voluntary
basis. We found 20% of respondents saying they were likely to quit in the
next 12 months, with 61% saying they were unlikely to leave and 18%
saying neither. Apart from a pandemic-related fall in 2021, there has been very
little change since 2019.
The reasons why people leave their job are similar to previous surveys.
The most commonly reported reasons were unsurprising – better pay and
conditions, work–life balance, and job satisfaction. Some 17% said they
wanted a different type of work. Less common were more flexible working
hours, opportunities for promotion, better job security, to get training, and
demand for remote working.
However, unhappiness with senior management and leadership is also
one of the most common reasons (22%). People can pick more than one
reason, so perceived failings by senior managers may not be the only trigger.
Nonetheless, how organisational leadership is perceived clearly matters
for staff turnover. In addition, 11% reported conflict with line managers or
colleagues, and 6% discrimination, bullying and harassment. Redundancy
accounted for 15% of responses.

8 Conflict in the workplace

This section focuses on reported conflict in the workplace over the last
12 months, including who is affected most and some of the associations
between conflict and workplace performance, wellbeing and place of work.
We start with a review of workplace relations across the workforce.
Workplace conflict
In the survey, conflict included:
• being humiliated or undermined at work
• heated arguments, being shouted at or verbally abused
• discrimination by reason of sex, race, disability, age
• intimidation
• sexual harassment or assault
• physical threat or assault.
The survey showed that a quarter of people in work had experienced at least
one of these forms of conflict or abuse in the last 12 months.
What form does conflict take?
The survey allowed people to report as many forms of conflict as they
felt applied. The most common form of conflict was being humiliated or
undermined at work (reported by 12%), followed by those who said they
were involved in a heated argument or shouted at or who were verbally
abused. Those who reported discrimination because of a protected
characteristic (such as sex, race, sexuality, age, or disability) accounted for
about 5%. Other forms of conflict, such as sexual harassment and assault and
physical threat and assault, were relatively uncommon, typically reported by
1–2%. These are shown in the left-hand column of Table 6. The table also
shows the same results expressed as a share of those who reported conflict
in the middle column.
What was the most important conflict reported?
The survey allowed respondents to make more than one response, so it’s
possible that conflicts reported as discrimination may be understated. For
example, someone may report a conflict as discrimination if someone
undermined or shouted at them at work because of race, sexuality or
disability and might therefore legitimately report both as a cause of conflict.
A follow-up question asked people to identify the one reason they thought
was the most important to them and to the organisation. However, the
relative ranking of discrimination and most other reported conflicts did not
greatly change on this measure (see right-hand column in Table 6).

Who is most affected by conflict?
As might be expected, those with protected characteristics reported more conflict,
given that legislation recognises they may be more subject to victimisation.
Women were more likely than men to report at least one form of conflict, as were
ethnic minorities compared with those who were white, and those with some
form of disability and those without. There were also marked differences by sexual
orientation – a third of those who identified as non-heterosexual reported conflict,
compared with 24% of those who identified as heterosexual. There were also
some significant differences by age. Of those under 35, 32% reported some form of
conflict, compared with 22% of those over 35 (see Figure 8).

Conflict by job contract, socioeconomic group and sector
Of those in atypical contracts, 38% had experienced conflict, compared with
26% of permanent employees. This in part is likely to be related to higher
rates of reported conflict for under-35s, given that younger workers are
much more likely to be in atypical work contracts. Reported conflict was also
somewhat higher for those in C2DE socioeconomic groups (28%), compared
with ABC1s (24%).
Those in the public sector were more likely to report conflict (31%) than
those in the private or voluntary sectors (24%). Within the private sector,
there are significant differences between low-pay services (retail and
hospitality), where 30% reported conflict, and high-pay services (information
and communication, professional, scientific and technical services, finance
and real estate), where 20% reported conflict, and production industries
(manufacturing, construction, and energy and water), where 21% did so
(see Figure 9).

How conflicts are resolved
The survey asked what had been done to resolve these conflicts, with people
able to select more than one option. The most dominant answer by far was
to just let it go (47% of all those in work said this). The next most common
was to have a discussion with HR (29%), and more informal discussions, either
with someone outside work, such as family or friends (21%), or with the other
person involved (17%) (see Figure 10).
However, exit was an option for a minority, with 9% saying they were looking
for another job and 3% saying they had left the organisation. Moreover, a
separate question in the survey showed that it was twice as common for
those who reported conflict to say they were likely to leave over the next
12 months (33%) than those who did not (16%).

Base: all who report having experienced any conflict in the last 12 months (n=1,365).

Most people said their conflict was either fully or partially resolved (66%),
but only 36% said it was fully resolved. It would, of course, be unrealistic to
suggest that every source of conflict can be resolved to the full satisfaction of
both parties. But over a third did say they had no resolution at all.
Most organisational and media attention is likely to focus on more formal
resolution procedures. This is understandable, given that they are likely to
involve more serious cases which have wider implications for organisations,
practitioners, individuals and policy-makers. However, they are not typical
of the way the vast majority of workplace conflicts are resolved. It was
comparatively rare to discuss it with a trade union representative, escalate it
into a formal grievance or involve a trained mediator. Hardly any involved a
case going to an employment tribunal.
We cannot say from the survey why relatively few people escalate conflicts
to the more formal stage. Some may have felt the incident, while distressing
at the time, was not worth pursuing more formally, especially if it was seen
as a one-off or that informal processes had addressed the issue sufficiently.
However, some may have thought that formal procedures would be a waste
of time or that they would be victimised for trying to invoke it. As we show
below, there is some evidence that the former may be somewhat more
common than the latter, but that is not conclusive.
Impact of conflict on work
Conflict can arise in the best-run workplaces, either with managers and
supervisors or between co-workers. In this section, we also look at the
association between reported incidence of conflict and indicators of
performance, job security, and mental and physical wellbeing.

Conflict in the workplace

CIPD Good Work Index 2024: Survey report

Work centrality, job and pay satisfaction, and work pressures
Earlier we reported on work centrality, measured by whether people thought a
job is just for money or something they would enjoy even if they did not need
cash. Experience of conflict does not appear to affect either of these.
However, those who had experienced conflict were much less likely to say
they thought their pay was appropriate given their responsibilities and much
less likely to say they were satisfied with their job. Some 38% who reported
conflict thought that their pay was appropriate, compared with 55% of those
who did not. Similarly, 54% of those who reported conflict were satisfied with
their job, compared with 77% of those who did not.
Those who reported conflict were also more likely to be in a high-pressure
job. They were much more likely to say that their workload is too high; that
they feel under pressure most or all of the time; or that they feel exhausted
most or all of the time. We cannot say from the survey whether this was
because of a high-pressure work environment more generally or an individual
struggling with pressure at work. Both are likely to be true. Those in conflict
were also much more likely to report negative impacts on their mental and
physical health. Table 7 gives details.

Management, teams and conflict
We also looked at a wider range of questions asking about views on
managers, supervisors and directors. It wouldn’t be a surprise if those involved
in conflict with their workplace seniors, or who felt that managers and seniors
were either unsympathetic to, or ineffectual in, resolving conflicts, viewed
their performance and their treatment negatively. The survey confirms this
association on most, but not all, measures.
Those who reported conflict were significantly less likely to think that senior
managers and directors had the right vision, that they were able, or that they
could be trusted to act with integrity.
However, the association between conflict and negative perceptions further
down the ladder at workplace level is much weaker. Only a small minority
of those who reported conflict also said that their relations with their line

manager were poor (15%), compared with 67% who reported it was good.
Similar views were expressed about other managers.
If the association between conflict and poor working relations with managers
is weak, it is non-existent for colleagues. There were no significant differences
between those who reported conflict and those who did not when it came
to rating relations with colleagues in the team or with other colleagues.
Managers who reported conflict gave similar responses on their working
relations with staff as those who did not.
This may be because people make a distinction between general working
relations and specific actions: those who reported conflict were more likely
to take a dimmer view of their manager’s performance when specific actions
were mentioned than they were for working relations in general.
Those who reported conflict were significantly less likely to say their manager
treated them with respect, treated them fairly, and was supportive if they had
a problem, compared with those who did not report conflict. Similarly, people
who had experienced conflict were more likely to agree that their manager
would hold a grudge against them if they made a mistake compared with
those who experienced no conflict.
Those who reported conflict were also more likely to agree that their team
sometimes rejected others for being different. They were also less likely to
agree that no one in their team would act to undermine efforts compared
with those who did not report conflict.
However, even with specific actions and behaviours, it was still the case that
most people who reported conflict also had favourable opinions of their
manager and teams. For example, around 60% of those who reported conflict
also said their managers treated them with respect and treated them fairly.
This is consistent with one interpretation: that at least some of these conflicts
were one-offs or sufficiently low level and therefore did limited damage to
people’s views of workplace relations.
Conflict and discretionary effort
There is only a weak association between indicators of discretionary effort
and conflict. Of those who reported conflict, 48% agreed they would work
harder than they needed to help their employer or organisation, compared
with 53% who did not. Those who reported conflict were just as willing to
volunteer to do things not formally required by the job, to help colleagues
with workloads and overcome hurdles, and to make innovative suggestions to
improve team quality as those who did not.
Conflict and voice in the workplace
There is a clearer association between conflict and lack of voice. For example,
around a third of those who reported conflict thought their managers were
good at responding to employee suggestions, seeking views and keeping them
informed, compared with around half of those who did not report conflict.
They were also much less likely to rate as ‘good’ the ability of employees to
influence final decisions or be involved in pay negotiations (compared with
those who did not report conflict) (see Table 8).

Conflict in the workplace

CIPD Good Work Index 2024: Survey report

Has conflict in the workplace risen or fallen?
Our survey previously asked questions about conflict in 2019. Over the last
five years, the proportion of the workforce reporting any conflict has fallen
from 30% to 25%.
The biggest falls were for male, white, non-disabled, over-35s from the higherskill socioeconomic group (ABC1s). There was also an above-average fall for
non-heterosexual workers, albeit from an exceptionally high level in 2019.
Those who experienced below-average falls were women, ethnic minorities,
and disabled workers, those in C2DE socioeconomic groups, the under35s, and those in atypical work contracts (where there is a slight but nonsignificant rise). However, results for the young and those in atypical work
should be treated with some caution, as they were underrepresented in the
2019 survey (see Table 9).

There was not a great deal of change in the types of conflicts being reported.
In both 2019 and 2024, the most reported were: being undermined or
humiliated at work, being shouted at or being in a heated argument, and
verbal assault or insult. There was, however, a fall in reports of people being
shouted at or being involved in a heated argument at work, from 13% down to
9%. Incidents of other offensive or threatening behaviour also fell from 5% in
2019 to 1% in 2024 (see Table 10).

Why has conflict fallen?
A fall in conflict is welcome, even if it is unevenly distributed. However, rather
than any underlying improvement in workplaces, the most important reason
is probably the large increase in homeworking since 2019. In 2024, the more
time people spend working at home, the less likely they are to report conflict
(see Figure 11). For example, just 15% of those who spent 75% or more of their
time at home reported conflict, compared with 30% of those who did no work
at home or spent 25% or less time at home.

Why homeworking might lower conflict
We only have sufficient sample numbers to look at homeworking by the most
common forms of conflict. Only 4% of those who worked at least half their
time from home reported being shouted at, compared with 11% who said they
did no or little work at home. Similarly, only 3% said they had been verbally
abused, compared with 12% of those who did little or no work at home. In
contrast, homeworking made much less difference in whether people reported
being undermined and humiliated at work or suffered discrimination.

Figure 12 could indicate a link between higher rates of homeworking and
lower rates of conflict that require people to be in physical proximity, such
as verbal abuse, being shouted at or getting into heated arguments. The
underlying relationship between working at home and conflict is likely to
be more complex, given that those who work at home a lot are also likely
to be in occupational and age groups which report lower levels of conflict.
Nonetheless, it is a plausible explanation of why more homeworking would
lead to fewer conflicts being reported.

9 Autonomy and control

Our survey asked about the control and autonomy people have over their
work. People had most control over how they did their work, with over 40%
saying they had a lot of control and 23% saying they had little or no control.
They had less control over the pace at which they did their work, and much
less control over the tasks they had to do and start and finish times. For
example, while 27% said they had a lot of control over start and finish times,
45% said they had little or none (see Figure 13).

CIPD Good Work Index 2024: Survey report

Autonomy by sector
People who work in the private or voluntary sector were more likely to say
they have a lot of control over work tasks, the pace of work, and how work
is done than people in the public sector. However, people who work in the
public and voluntary sectors were more likely to say they have a lot of control
over start and finish times than those in the private sector.
The production sector (manufacturing, energy and water, and construction)
and some high-wage private sectors (information and communication, and
professional and scientific services) have above-average levels of autonomy
on most measures, and the low-pay private sector industries (retail and
hospitality) and public services have below-average levels. For example,
while around 40% of people who work in high-pay services and production
industries said they have a lot of control over the pace at which they work,
this fell to around 30% in public and low-pay private services. Similarly, while
about 50% of people who work in production and high-pay services said they
have a lot of control over how they do their job, the figure was just 30% in
low-pay services (Figure 14).
In some ways, the public sector looks more like low-pay private services
than the high-pay services or production when it comes to control over how
work is done. One underlying reason may be that much of the public sector
provides common services with common standards and procedures to the
general population, and in some areas with centrally imposed targets. This in
turn may limit how much autonomy can be given to individuals about the
services they provide.

Autonomy by personal characteristics and socioeconomic group
There is not a huge variation of these measures by personal characteristics
such as gender, sexuality, age, disability, or by employment status or tenure.
The main exception was between men and women, where men consistently
reported higher levels of autonomy than women, most likely reflecting
differences in the type of jobs they do. There is a strong association by
socioeconomic group, with much higher levels of autonomy for those in the
ABC1 socioeconomic group (Figure 15).

Working at home and autonomy
As shown in Figure 16, the survey confirms that those who work at home
have significantly higher levels of autonomy than those who don’t. There is
clearly an association between working at home and greater autonomy, and it
is often seen as one of the big advantages of homeworking.
Those who said they have never worked at home had much less autonomy
than those who did. It didn’t greatly matter how much time people spent at
home.
However, we suggest that these differences are because of the sort of jobs
homeworkers do, rather than homeworking itself. There has been no significant
change in the level of autonomy reported since 2019 for all workers and for
those in the ABC1 socioeconomic groups. And it is the ABC1 group which
provides most homeworking and has driven the increase in homeworking since
the pandemic. Put another way, had we not seen the pandemic-induced surge
in homeworking, the results in the 2024 survey on autonomy would not have
been very different. This is also likely to be true for most other measures of job
quality, which also show little or no change since 2019.

10 Skills and training in the
workplace

As in previous years, our survey asked people to assess whether their skills
match the demands of their job and whether their qualifications correspond
to their job. Skills and qualifications are different things, but both measures
suggest a significant problem of underskilling and overqualification.
In 2024, 35% of respondents thought they had the skills to do more than their job
demands, compared with just 12% who thought they lacked the skills to do their
job well (see Figure 17). Similarly, 31% of respondents thought their qualifications
exceeded those required by the job, while just 5% said they were underqualified.
There may be some caveats with these questions, as bodies such as the
OECD have suggested that people tend to overstate what they can do with
their existing skills and qualifications, and have published estimates based on
more sophisticated measures.2 However, despite this, a significant underlying
problem of skill and qualification mismatch remains and, worryingly, there has
been no significant change since 2019.

work, with nearly as many (35%) disagreeing. Since 2019, there have been
improvements in all of these measures, as shown in Figure 18, and there was
no significant change in the numbers who disagreed with these propositions.

forms of training and learning, such as on the job (46%) and learning from
peers (23%). A tenth said they attended external conferences, events and

Training and learning with a more formal element was less frequently
mentioned, including blended learning, off-the-job training and in-house
development, coaching, getting formal qualifications, and receiving
secondment, job shadowing or job rotation opportunities. There was little
mention of training or learning specifically about emerging technologies,
such as AI or VR – just 2% – though possibly some of this might arise in other
forms of learning.
The vast majority said they found these forms of learning and training useful
(typically over 90%). There was, however, somewhat less satisfaction with
online learning, with 71% saying it was useful and 29% saying it wasn’t.
The same question was asked in 2018, but some of the questions have
changed so we can only do a partial comparison. The main change is a large
increase in online learning, reported by 27% in 2018 and 42% in 20243 – likely
reflecting both underlying growth and the impact of the pandemic. Most
other forms of learning did not greatly change. We were, however, unable to
compare on-the-job training due to different questions being asked in 2018.

11 Conclusion and

recommendations
Conflict in the workplace has a negative impact on almost every aspect of
work measured in this survey. With 25% of the workforce surveyed reporting
conflict in the last year, that extrapolates into over 8 million people at work
who might be affected by it. Reducing conflict must be part of an overall
strategy to improve work quality. It is especially important for those with
protected characteristics, who have above-average incidence of conflict and
have seen no improvement over the last five years.
The main focus should be on the role of the line manager and the people
function, because it is at the workplace level that most conflicts arise, where
the impacts are felt, and where they are resolved or not. Thankfully, very few
conflicts ever escalate to formal grievances, mediation, or industrial tribunal.
Legislative reforms and improvements in how these more formal processes
operate are helpful and can address the worst abuses, but our contention is
that they are unlikely to greatly reduce the overall incidence of lower-level
conflict in the workplace.
Investing in line management training to deal with conflict effectively and
address underlying causes, such as poor team practices, is likely to be more
effective. The fact that working relations with line managers and colleagues
seem fairly robust – even when conflicts arise – suggests a solid base that
further support and development can be built on.
In doing so, we are clear that reducing conflict as defined in this survey
cannot be at the expense of suppressing healthy challenge or reconciling
different viewpoints and perspectives that inevitably arise in workplaces and
that often lead to better solutions and more productive outcomes.4

Reducing conflict cannot, however, be done just by looking at process and
management. Just as conflict leads to worse outcomes, poor work practices
lead to more conflict. A successful workplace-based approach will seek
to identify and address underlying causes of conflict, such as excessive
workloads, exhaustion and pressure.
A practical initiative the CIPD has advocated for some years is to provide
locally delivered business support services to SMEs on HR and people
management issues, through key stakeholders and established business
networks. The CIPD’s People Skills pilots have shown that a limited amount
of free ‘pump-priming’ HR consultancy support to small firms can not only
build owner-manager confidence and people management capability, but also
deliver positive outcomes for their staff.

Conclusion and recommendations

12

CIPD Good Work Index 2024: Survey report

Overskilling and overqualification remain significant drags on realising the
workforce’s full potential and show no sign of improvement. Increasing job
demands so the skills that people already have are used better will help, but
we also need to address broader questions about the supply of skills and
qualifications. Successive governments have struggled to create a robust
training infrastructure outside the university system, and it remains a longterm challenge for the next government.
Some incremental changes could, however, be made relatively quickly to
build on existing initiatives to improve skills investment for young people and
older workers. Making the Apprenticeship Levy more flexible would give firms
and organisations more scope to respond in ways that meet the needs of the
business and learners more effectively.
There has been growing concern at the increase in the economically inactive
due to long-term sickness and the associated rise in welfare bills since 2019.5 Our
survey suggests this has little to do with work making people sicker. However, the
survey also shows that not all jobs are good for you: 25% of those in work report
negative impacts on mental and physical health. A fully coherent policy response
requires a revitalised good work policy building on previous government initiatives.
The 2024 survey shows (as have all previous surveys) there has been little
progress on raising job quality since the UK Government’s Good Work Plan
was published in 2018, setting out a vision of the UK’s future labour market.
There is a great deal of positive practice and outcomes to build on – most
people have a good experience at work and have good relations with
managers and colleagues – but for a large minority, there are significant
shortcomings that are still to be addressed.

12 About this report

This survey report is based on the seventh annual UK Working Lives survey. The
report’s central purpose is to set out how people work, what they think about it,
and how that has changed over the last five years. It achieves this by capturing
data on seven dimensions of work to define what good work looks like.
The 2024 survey was conducted in January and February 2024 and provides
a total sample of 5,496 (unweighted figure) workers. To make the samples
representative of the UK as a whole, quotas were used to target the sample,
and subsequent weights based on ONS figures were applied to the dataset. The
sample is representative of the UK workforce in: the intersection of gender by
full- or part-time work status; organisation size within sector; industry; and age.
A subsample of approximately 1,000 of the 2019 respondents have since been
resurveyed in 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023 and 2024, allowing us to observe how
the quality of work evolves within jobs.
