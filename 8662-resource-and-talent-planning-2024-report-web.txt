1 Foreword

We are pleased to support the CIPD for a fourth year to produce the Resourcing
and talent planning report 2024. This report provides critical insights into resourcing
and talent planning challenges and offers essential support for business leaders and
people professionals to navigate today’s powerful megatrends and resultant labour
market shortages to build strategies that futureproof their organisations.
Persistent skills shortages and the increasing number of individuals leaving the
workforce have created unprecedented pressures on the labour market. Longer term,
as home-grown labour struggles to increase with no rises in net migration, labour
supply will deteriorate significantly in the next ten years, meaning organisations must
plan now. These findings and recommendations will support those that want to get
ahead of these challenges.
Forward-thinking organisations have embraced flexible working and are developing
talent strategies to build workforce resilience and to attract and retain talent. They
recognise that offering above-market rates is unlikely to be enough in the long run.
Rather, they see the direct link between investment in talent acquisition and bottomline performance, while investing wisely in people, partnerships, and technology.
It’s pleasing to see the continued positive focus towards equality, diversity, and
inclusion (EDI) which is prompting organisations to search for talent in hard-toreach places. This approach not only broadens the talent pool but also brings diverse
perspectives and new ways of thinking into an organisation. As employees are
increasingly seeking purposeful work and organisations whose values align with their
own, employers must be forward-thinking to attract and retain talent, and recognise
that candidates are now driving the market. This requires a proactive stance on EDI
and a commitment to creating an inclusive workplace that resonates with employee
values and creates a sense of security.
To thrive, organisations must plan strategically to retain and upskill their workforce.
Those who do will succeed in setting new standards and will outperform their
competitors. Those who choose not to, will most certainly be left behind.
This report serves as a roadmap for your journey to a robust and futureproof talent
strategy.

2 Summary of key findings

Competition for talent persists
• Competition for well-qualified talent has increased over the last year, according to
69% of respondents. Overall, 84% had tried to fill some vacancies and 64% of these
experienced difficulties attracting candidates. Recruiting for senior and skilled roles
was most challenging, particularly in the public sector (52%), although 19% also had
difficulties attracting low-skilled candidates.
• The recent changes to legal migration rules for family and work visas may further
affect competition for talent in some industries. A tenth of organisations are
planning to reduce their recruitment of migrants and 18% are improving their
job offering to attract UK-born workers in response to the rule changes. Overall,
43% of organisations expect the migration rule changes to have some impact on
resourcing in their organisation.
• Many organisations are experiencing increasing retention challenges (56%), and
we have seen a rise in the proportion of organisations taking steps to counter
this, from 29% in 2021 to 42% in 2024. Retaining new recruits is also an issue for
many organisations: 41% of those that selected candidates in the last 12 months
said new recruits always, mostly or sometimes resigned within the first 12 weeks,
while 27% said that selected candidates always, mostly or sometimes failed to
turn up on their first day.

Practitioner recommendations
Take a strategic approach to workforce planning. Review your organisation’s
 critical
skills and key roles and look at the data on retaining these people.
Proactively widen your talent pools. Vary and target your recruitment
 outreach
approach and channels and ensure your employer brand is
attractive and communicated well to a diverse group of candidates.



Engage candidates throughout the recruitment process to ensure they are
committed to the role and your organisation and have realistic expectations.
Ensure onboarding and induction helps them perform at their best.

Greater focus on developing skills in-house
• Organisations are increasingly turning to internal training and development to
meet their talent requirements, as 56% said they developed more talent in-house
over the last 12 months compared with the previous year. Most organisations that
attempted to recruit over the last year experienced difficulties (83%) and upskilling
existing employees was their most common response.
• More organisations are using entry-level or career-returner programmes to access
and grow the skills they need. Some 51% currently offer apprenticeships, 44%
graduate programmes, 35% intern schemes, 34% post-A-level entry routes and 34%
career-returner programmes.

Summary of key findings

Resourcing and talent planning report 2024

• A higher proportion of organisations are also turning to learning and development
(L&D) to retain employees. Of those that undertook specific initiatives to improve
employee retention in the last 12 months, 42% increased L&D opportunities to
address retention, up from 35% in 2022. Meanwhile, 31% created clearer career
paths, up from 24% in 2022.

Practitioner recommendations
Invest in ways for people to access opportunities in your organisation, such
 as
through apprenticeships (with funding available), traineeships, industry
placements and post-A-level routes. Keep up to date with new products
and routes.
Develop strategies to attract career-returners and mid-career-changers to
 help
broaden your talent pool and diversify people’s skills and experiences.
Create strategic in-house talent development and L&D programmes to upskill
 existing
employees in priority areas and encourage them to think about
lateral moves as progression. Don’t overlook internal talent for promotions.

Improving pay and benefits
• Organisations that have attempted to recruit in the last 12 months and experienced
difficulties are increasingly offering better pay and benefits to address recruitment
difficulties (41%, compared with 36% in 2022 and 29% in 2021), although this
is more common in the private sector. Over a quarter of those that attempted
to recruit (27%) reported challenges with counteroffers or dropouts after offer
acceptance. A fifth (20%) of organisations report that candidates always or mostly
renegotiated offer terms (up from 15% in 2022), even though 61% say candidates
always or mostly had realistic salary expectations.
• Increasing pay was also one of the most common responses of those that have
experienced retention difficulties in the last 12 months (44%), topped only by
improving support for employee wellbeing (47%, rising to 79% for non-profits).
• Similarly, ensuring a competitive pay and benefits package (34%) and increasing
flexible working opportunities (35%) were the most common actions taken to
improve employer brand, although public sector organisations were more focused
on promoting their values (41%) than pay (16%). There has also been an increase
in the proportion of organisations attempting to enhance their brand through
improving the work environment and career development options.

Summary of key findings

Resourcing and talent planning report 2024

Practitioner recommendations
Review the market and what is feasible when it comes to pay, but also
 take
into consideration any changes that might be helpful to your overall
benefits package. This doesn’t necessarily need to be expensive, for
example introducing a scheme to buy and sell leave.
Advertise salaries in job adverts and provide information on the pension
 scheme
and other core benefits. Don’t ask about previous salaries during the
recruitment process. Following this approach will help support fairness and
widen the applicant pool.
Now is a good time to critically assess your employee value proposition.
 Employees
value different benefits at different life stages, so be flexible in
your offering and allow for personalisation – let people choose what is most
important to them.

Benefits of flexible working offerings increasingly recognised
• Increasing flexible and hybrid working opportunities are among the most common
steps organisations have taken over the last year to improve their employee brand.
Nearly three-quarters (74%) advertise at least some jobs as open to flexible working,
and 54% as ‘open to location’ (up from 47% in 2022). For people in front-line/nonoffice roles, 57% offer some form of flexible working. Offering greater flexibility is
one of the most common responses to recruitment difficulties (52%).
• Hybrid/remote working is increasing, particularly in the private sector. Most
organisations now offer some home/hybrid options, with 29% reporting they have
increased their offering in the last 12 months and 26% anticipating further increases
in the next 12 months. Seven in 10 (71%) of those that offer home or hybrid work
report this has allowed them to attract and retain more talent.
• Organisations are increasingly positive regarding the impact of hybrid/remote
working on engagement and retention, with 42% of those that offer this saying
it has increased engagement (from 35% in 2022) and 45% saying it has increased
retention (from 32% in 2022).

Practitioner recommendations
Stipulate in job adverts that jobs can be done flexibly. This will help you
 attract
a wider pool of candidates looking for flexible roles and address
skills shortages.

6

Raise awareness of different forms of flexible working, such as compressed
 hours
and job-sharing, and explore how they can be effective in roles that have

7

traditionally been seen as non-flexible. This is particularly important for employees
who can’t work remotely and need to attend their physical place of work.

Along with the benefits of flexible and hybrid working come the challenges
of onboarding, induction, development and wellbeing. Ensure you have
policies and practices in place that effectively induct new hires and develop
managers to manage a flexible workforce.

Small improvements in recruiting diverse candidates
• This year’s findings show improvements in efforts to attract and recruit diverse
candidates, including at board level. Forty per cent are very or extremely active in
their efforts to recruit diverse board candidates, up from 32% in 2022.
• Over half (51%) of those that attempted to fill vacancies say they recruited a more
diverse workforce compared with the previous year. Nevertheless, there was an
increase in the proportion reporting challenges hiring diverse talent, from 16% in
2022 to 29% this year.
• Fifty per cent have provided inclusive leadership training or coaching for managers
or leaders over the last 12 months. More are training line managers involved in
hiring decisions, and 73% (up from 67% in 2022) report that line managers follow
objective assessment and scoring criteria when recruiting. But just 28% train all
interviewers on legal obligations and objectives.

Ensure
managers on effective inclusive selection. Ensure the criteria you use to
hire people is truly predictive of performance in role, and create assessment
processes that objectively assess these in candidates.

2
Technology speeding up recruitment and improving experience
• Some 78% of organisations have increased their use of technology in the
recruitment and onboarding process over the last 12 months. Nearly a third (31%)
use some form of AI/machine learning – up from 16% in 2022. Nevertheless, the
adoption of many available technologies remains limited.

• Using technology in recruitment is widely seen to increase accessibility for
candidates. Organisations are also increasingly reporting that technology has
improved their candidates’ experience and sped up the recruitment process. Of
those that use AI, 66% said it improved hiring efficiency and 62% said it increased
the availability of useful information for resource planning.

• As in previous years, most respondents believe their use of technology has been
limited by lack of resources, skills and knowledge.

Rise in data use and talent management as priority
• More organisations are collecting data to inform their workforce planning and
resourcing. The proportions of employers collecting data on the performance of
new hires (31%, from 24% in 2022), the effectiveness of retention initiatives (20%,
from 12% in 2022), the predictive validity of assessment methods (12%, from 7% in
2022) and the return on investment (ROI) of their recruitment processes (24%, from
13% in 2022) have all risen. Nevertheless, it is clear that many could take a more
evidence-based approach.
• Organisations vary considerably in how far ahead they look when planning and
taking action on current and future workforce requirements. Thirty-one per cent
take a short-term approach (up to six months), while 18% are planning over two
years into the future.
• More in line with pre-pandemic levels, 46% of respondents say their CEO has had
talent management as a key priority over the last 12 months, up from 38% in 2022.

3 Current resourcing and
talent practices

Variability in resourcing activity
The estimated number of vacancies in the UK has been declining since their postpandemic peak around the time of our 2022 survey. While the overall level remains
high by historical standards,1 weak economic growth, high interest rates, rising
living cost pressures, and wage inflation have meant a challenging year for many
organisations.
Figure 1 shows considerable variability in resourcing activity over the last 12 months.
Three in 10 organisations increased recruitment over the last year, while 17% decreased
recruitment and 21% put recruitment activity on hold. Use of external services and/or
temporary labour was increased in 20% of organisations and reduced in 19%.
The public sector was particularly divided: 30% reported recruitment had increased,
30% that it had decreased, and 29% that it had been put on hold. The proportion
making redundancies (17%) was similar across sectors.

Resourcing and talent planning report 2024

Competition for talent persists
Acute skill shortages persist, despite the loosening of the labour market. Significantly,
69% of respondents report that competition for well-qualified talent has increased
over the past year, while 56% assert that talent is more difficult to retain (Figure 2).
Growing retention challenges have been a particular issue for the public sector,
where 71% report increased difficulty retaining talent.
The cooling of the labour market is reflected in the proportion of organisations that
attempted to fill vacancies in the last year reporting they received more applicants
for each vacancy compared with the previous year (Figure 2). They are more likely,
however, to have seen an increase in the number of unsuitable applicants (52%) than
suitable ones (34%).
Fifty-six per cent of organisations are increasing efforts to meet their talent
requirements by developing more talent in-house, while 35% have replaced some
jobs over the last year with technology and automation.
Many organisations are also widening their recruitment nets: 51% of those that
attempted to fill vacancies say they recruited a more diverse workforce compared with
the previous year and 45% recruited from a wider geography within the UK. Offering
hybrid or remote working options can help expand the potential labour pool: 71% of
organisations that offer this say it has allowed them to attract and retain more talent.

Impact of changes to migration rules
In March and April 2024, changes to UK migration rules for family and work visas
came into force (see Box 1). Some 43% of respondents expect these changes to
affect their resourcing. The private sector was most likely to anticipate an impact
(48%), while public sector respondents were more likely to say they don’t know how
their resourcing will be affected (21%) (Figure 3). Larger organisations, with higher
resourcing requirements, were also more likely to anticipate an impact (SMEs: 27%;
larger organisations: 55%).
A tenth (10%) of organisations say they will reduce recruitment of migrant workers
(Figure 4), while 23% will focus more on developing skills internally and 18%
on improving job offerings to attract UK-born workers. Others plan to increase
investment in automation (15%) or outsource more (14%). Smaller proportions report
they will relocate the business or downsize in response to the changes.

Box 1: Changes to legal migration rules for family and work visas in 2024
• Social care workers are no longer allowed to bring dependants (ie partners
and children) on their visa.
• The baseline minimum salary to be sponsored for a Skilled Worker visa has
increased from £26,200 to £38,700, while the ‘going rate’ minimum salary
specific to each job has also gone up significantly.
• A list of jobs for which it is possible to sponsor someone for a Skilled Worker
visa at a reduced minimum salary has been made shorter and renamed the
Immigration Salary List.
• The minimum income normally required to sponsor someone for a spouse/
partner visa has risen from £18,600 to £29,000. There are plans to increase it
to around £34,500 later in 2024 and finally to around £38,700 by early 2025.

4 Recruiting activity, costs
and budgets

Most organisations had some recruitment activity
Sixty-three per cent of organisations attempted to fill permanent vacancies in the last
12 months (2022: 72%; 2021: 65%) and 48% (2022: 49%; 2021: 47%) had attempted
to fill short-term vacancies (34% temporary or interim vacancies and 35% fixed-term
contractors). Just 16%, mostly small private sector organisations, had not attempted
to fill any vacancies.
Over half make some use of recruitment agencies/outsourcing
Overall, 47% of organisations conduct all recruitment in-house with direct hiring,
although this is more common among non-profits (77%) and least common in the
private sector (43%). Twenty per cent conduct recruitment in-house with the use
of recruitment agencies and 31% use a combination of in-house and outsourced
recruitment. Few outsource all their recruitment (3%).

Of organisations that recruited over the last year, 56% sourced the majority of new

non-profits and the public sector. Private sector organisations were more likely than
the public sector or non-profits to source candidates via a recruitment agency or
recruitment process outsourcing (RPO) partner, or through proactive approaches.
These findings are reflected in Figure 6.

Recruitment costs decreasing
Of our respondents, 246 were able to provide average costs per hire for senior
managers/directors and 207 for other employees with an accuracy of ±20%.
The costs of recruiting vary considerably. The median cost of recruiting senior
managers (£2,000) has fallen from £3,000 in 2022, and Table 1 suggests this is part of
a longer-term reduction in median recruitment costs. The median cost of recruiting
other employees remains the same as last year (£1,500), although the longer-term
data for this group also shows a decline, albeit a less dramatic one. It is possible
that as the economic climate has tightened, so too have recruitment budgets. The
adoption of new recruitment technologies may also have had an impact.
In previous years, the median cost per hire has been higher in the private than in
the public and non-profit sectors. In a change this year, median recruitment costs
for senior managers/directors are highest in the public sector (Table 1), although

for ‘other employees’ they remain highest in the private sector. This may reflect the
particular difficulties public sector organisations have experienced over the last year
in recruiting for senior positions (see Recruitment difficulties). Considerable caution
should be taken in comparing and interpreting these figures, however, due to the
small sample size and high variation across organisations (part of which may be
attributable to the inclusion of different costs in estimates).

Recruitment and talent management budgets
Thirty-two per cent of private sector organisations anticipate an increase to their
recruitment budget in 2024/25 and just 10% anticipate a decrease. The converse is
broadly true in the public sector (Figure 7). Non-profits are most likely to expect their
budget to remain the same, with around one in five (19%) anticipating an increase.
There is a similar pattern for talent management budgets (Figure 8).
These findings highlight the strain on public sector finances and the challenges they
face in balancing delivery with cutting costs. CIPD research showed that public sector
employers had been twice as likely as those in the private sector to be planning to
lower staffing levels. Cash-strapped councils, civil service streamlining, and higher
wage costs could be contributing factors.
Overall, nearly one in 10, predominantly small organisations, do not anticipate any
recruitment over the next year. Smaller organisations were also more likely to report
no talent management spend.

5 Attraction strategies

Most took action to improve employer brand
In a competitive labour market, an appealing employer brand is critical for attracting
and retaining talent, and so 81% of organisations took some action to improve
their brand over the last year (Figure 9). Expanding flexible working opportunities
and making pay and benefits more competitive continue to be the most common
initiatives, although there are sector differences. The non-profit sector was
notably likely to increase flexible working (48%), while cash-strapped public sector
organisations were less likely to take action to improve pay and benefits (16%) and
more likely to refresh or promote their values (41%).
Figure 9 shows a rise in the proportion that moved to develop social media
content strategy, improve candidate experience, the work environment and career
development options, as well as attend career fairs or networking events, compared
with our last survey.

Just 14% have taken steps to measure the impact of their employer brand, although
there was a small increase in the proportion monitoring feedback received through
websites such as Glassdoor and social media.
A minority focused on employee-led content (16%) or created a brand ambassador
programme to encourage internal engagement (8%). Harnessing employee voice can
create a more genuine and relatable brand image and help to attract candidates who
align with the company’s values and culture, as well as provide insights that can help
organisations improve their practices.

Multi-channel approach to attracting candidates
Many organisations, particularly larger ones, use a range of methods to attract
candidates (Figure 10). Corporate websites, internal advertising to existing talent
pools and recruitment/search consultants continue to be among the most effective
approaches. But, as shown in Figure 11, the proportion that hold these methods as
effective has dropped over the last few years, possibly in part due to changes in
candidate behaviour and the competitive talent market.
Job boards and professional and social networking sites (for both targeted campaigns and
organic content) also feature among the most effective methods of attracting candidates.
Some 14% found directly targeting passive candidates effective and 9% the use of
programmatic advertising (ie using automated technology to buy advertising space).
As in previous years, there are considerable sector differences in this area. Private sector
organisations were less likely than public or non-profit employers to include their
own corporate website or internal advertising and more likely to include recruitment/
search consultants, and direct targeting of passive jobseekers among their effective
attraction methods. They were also more likely to include professional/employee
referral schemes. These can be helpful and cost-effective in attracting candidates
when the labour market is tight, and act as an incentive for employees to recommend
their employer as a great place to work, but employers need to take steps to ensure
that recruitment standards and equality, diversity and inclusion (EDI) issues are not
compromised through such schemes. The public sector was most likely to include
secondments and commercial/industry-specific job boards and specialist journals/
trade press among their most effective methods, while non-profits were most likely to
include advertising roles as open to flexible working arrangements. These differences
reflect, at least in part, variation in the attraction methods used across sectors.

Most take some steps to attract diverse candidates
Overall, 66% say their organisation has a formal EDI strategy (8% don’t know). They
were most common (85%) in the public sector (non-profit: 72%; private: 62%) and in
larger organisations across all sectors.
Figures 12 and 13 suggest small improvements in efforts to attract diverse candidates
and address diversity in recruitment and selection. The public sector, non-profits and
larger private organisations were most proactive, as in previous years. But many could
take a more robust and comprehensive approach to increase accessibility, attract
a wider range of candidates and remove bias from their recruitment and selection
processes. Interestingly, there has been a reduction (35%, down from 39% in 2022, and
40% in 2021) in including an EDI statement in job descriptions or on career sites.

Rise in entry-level and career-returner programmes
With strong competition for talent, a sizeable proportion (56%) are increasing efforts to
meet their needs by developing more talent in-house (Figure 2).
In line with this, Figure 16 shows a small increase in the proportion of organisations
using or planning to introduce entry-level or career-returner programmes to access
and grow the skills they need. Currently, 51% offer apprenticeships, 44% graduate
programmes, and just over a third offer intern schemes (35%), post-A-level entry routes
(34%) or career-returner programmes (34%).
All the initiatives listed in Figure 16 were more common in larger organisations. In
addition, apprenticeships and graduate programmes were more common in the public
sector, while intern schemes were somewhat more common in the private sector.

6 Flexible and hybrid/remote
working

Demand for flexible and hybrid/remote working remains strong: 71% of those that
offer it report that offering home or hybrid working has allowed them to attract and
retain more talent (Figure 2), and offering greater work flexibility has been one of the
most common responses to recruitment difficulties (Figure 31). Increasing flexible and
hybrid working has also been among the most common steps taken over the last
year to improve employee brand (Figure 9).
Increase in hybrid/remote working
Most organisations now offer some hybrid/remote options, with 29% reporting
their use of these has increased in the last 12 months (Figure 17). There has been a
corresponding rise in the proportion of organisations (54%) that advertise at least
some vacancies as ‘open to location’ – up from 47% in 2022 (Figure 18).
There are a number of sectoral differences. Public sector organisations, with their
high proportion of front-line roles, were most likely to report they have never offered
hybrid/remote working and were less likely to advertise vacancies as open to location
(Figures 17 and 18). Non-profits were most likely to offer some form of hybrid/remote
work and to report no change over the last year. Increases in hybrid/remote working
were most common among private organisations, which were also more than twice
as likely as their public or non-profit counterparts to anticipate further increases in
their use of hybrid/remote working (Figure 19).

More are benefiting from hybrid/remote working
Most organisations have benefited from offering hybrid/remote working options.
Over two-fifths believe their productivity, engagement and retention have increased
as a consequence (Figure 20). Some, however, report a negative impact in these
areas, particularly regarding the impact of hybrid/remote working on engagement
in the organisation culture. Nevertheless, organisations are less negative regarding
the impact of hybrid/remote working on engagement and retention than in 2022,
perhaps a consequence of learning how to overcome the challenges of hybrid/
remote working and to manage it more effectively.
CIPD research suggested that effective onboarding of hybrid and remote workers can
pose particular challenges, and this year’s survey explored if organisations are making
efforts to address this. Among those that offer hybrid/remote working, 55% have
reviewed their induction/onboarding approach for home/hybrid workers over the last
five years, most commonly through facilitating meetings and introductions early in
the induction process and increasing technology and other support (Figure 21). Of
those that had reviewed their approach, 48% provided opportunities for socialising
and social connections, 43% assigned new recruits a mentor or buddy, and 48%
provided support with understanding the organisation culture.
Investing in effective onboarding is likely to reap benefits. Those that had reviewed
their induction/onboarding support for home/hybrid workers were more likely to
report that home/hybrid working has had a positive impact on productivity, retention
and engagement (particularly engagement in the organisation culture) compared
with those that hadn’t reviewed their induction/onboarding approach.

Nearly three-quarters advertise jobs as open to flexible working
Some 23% advertise all job vacancies as open to flexible working and an additional 50% do
so for at least some jobs (Figure 22). SMEs are most likely to report they do not advertise
any jobs as open to flexible working (38%, compared with 11% of larger organisations).

job offerings and meet employees’ needs.2 New questions this year explored the
extent of flexible working offerings for workers in non-office and front-line roles: 57%
offered some form of flexible working for people in these roles, while 23% didn’t, with

no significant differences across sectors (Figure 23). Flexibility in start and finish times was
the most common offering overall, followed by flexibility of location and in scheduling
of shifts/rotas. The majority of the public sector also offer compressed hours (72%) and
job-shares (60%) to non-office/front-line workers, but these were far less common in the
private and non-profit sectors.

7 Selection processes

Less focus on previous experience and education
Most organisations, particularly larger organisations, use a combination of methods in
their selection process. There is a decline in the use of previously common selection
methods, including work history/experience and educational qualifications (Figure 24).
This may be partly due to the increased focus on skills-based hiring and developing
any missing skills. There has not been a reduction in the proportion of organisations
sponsoring professional qualifications in response to recruitment difficulties (Figure 31).
There has been a reduction in the proportion conducting thorough CV/application
screening, although more are using these as a base for interviews.
Most organisations (90%) use some form of selection interview. Around half conduct
interviews that follow the contents of CVs/applications (55%), competency-based
interviews (52%) and/or skills-based interviews (48%). Around two-fifths use strengthsbased and/or values-based interviews, although these were both more common in the
public and non-profit sectors.
As in previous years, around three-fifths of organisations (61%) use some form of
test or assessment (Figure 24); however, there is a fall in the proportion conducting
pre-application assessments (ie situational judgement tests). Just 10% use tools to
enable self-selection. Wider adoption of these tools would likely be beneficial, given
our findings in Figure 2 that over half of organisations report receiving an increased
number of unsuitable candidates over the last year.

Limited adoption of recruitment technologies
The adoption of recruitment technology remains very limited, with only 26% of
organisations using applicant tracking systems. Video and telephone interviews
remain the most common technologies used in the recruitment process, although
their use has fallen over the last few years. The use of most other technologies
shown in Figure 25 has increased, but only very slightly.

Limited but increasing use of AI
Figure 26 suggests an increase in the use of AI or machine learning technologies
in recruitment processes, although this remains far from common. Around fourfifths of SMEs and public sector organisations, and an even higher proportion of
non-profits, don’t use any AI or machine learning technologies in their recruitment
process. Although small adoption overall, there are some significant shifts in use,
such as with using AI to write job descriptions to appeal to candidates (7 percentage
points increase since 2022), using chatbots to respond to candidates’ questions (9
percentage points increase), AI to shortlist candidates (7 percentage points increase),
and onboarding (8 percentage points increase). These shifts are being driven by
the widespread adoption of free generative AI tools, as well as software vendors
incorporating generative AI features.

Technology is speeding up the recruitment process and improving candidates’
experience
Organisations that use technology in the recruitment process report a number of
benefits (Figure 27), the most common being increasing accessibility for candidates.
For many, this appears to have increased the number of both suitable and unsuitable
candidates. But 58% say technology use has helped screen out unsuitable candidates
to some or a great extent.
More organisations this year say technology use has improved candidates’ experience,
at least to a small extent (2024: 85%; 2022: 78%; 2021: 68%) and sped up the
recruitment process (2024: 82%; 2022: 72%; 2021: 64%).
A rising proportion say that technology use has helped reduce unconscious bias,
increased the diversity and quality of their hires, and improved their understanding of
jobseeker behaviour.
At the same time, many feel their use of technology has been limited by a lack of
internal technical skills/knowledge and/or resources. Figures 25 and 26 show relatively
limited adoption of available technologies, despite most organisations reporting they
have increased their use of technology in the last 12 months (Figure 27). Considered
investment may enable organisations to further refine and improve their recruitment
processes and outcomes.

AI increases hiring efficiency
Figure 28 shows that 66% of those that use AI in resourcing report it has increased hiring
efficiency, although 47% report it has increased costs. Sixty-two per cent report it has
increased the availability of useful information for resourcing planning and 59% that it has
increased performance in the resourcing function. Contrary to expectations of AI replacing
people in organisations, 48% report that using AI has led to an increase in the number
of people in their resourcing function and just 14% report it has led to a decrease.

A quarter attempting to reduce or monitor jobseeker use of generative AI
While AI has many potential benefits, some are increasingly concerned that
jobseekers could use generative AI in applications to make themselves appear to be
more suitable candidates. A new question this year found that nearly a quarter of
organisations (23%) are attempting to reduce or monitor the use of generative AI by
jobseekers (19% don’t know).
For more information, see the CIPD guide Preparing your organisation for AI use.
Room for improvement in communications with candidates and new recruits
Figure 29 suggests that, on the whole, among those that have tried to recruit in
the last 12 months, candidates behave with sincerity, respond in a timely manner
to communications and arrive promptly for interviews. However, 17% report that
candidates commonly cancelled interviews with little or no notice, and 14% found
that candidates ‘always’ or ‘mostly’ went on to decline offers they had accepted. In
addition, many organisations had at least some experience (27%) of offered candidates
not arriving to work on their first day, and 41% report that new recruits always, mostly
or sometimes resigned within the first 12 weeks. These findings emphasise the
importance of ensuring effective end-to-end recruitment and onboarding processes,
including robust selection processes to assess commitment to role and organisation.
Similar to last year, 61% of organisations said candidates mostly or always had
realistic salary expectations. However, there has been a small increase in the
proportion reporting that candidates always or mostly renegotiated offer terms (20%,
compared with 15% in 2022). This was most common in the private sector, where
just 33% say this was rarely or never the case, compared with 53% of the public
sector and 59% of non-profits. Private sector organisations were also more likely to
report that candidates accepted offers and then subsequently declined.

8 Recruitment difficulties

Nearly two-thirds experienced challenges attracting candidates
Of those that attempted to recruit over the last year, 64% experienced difficulties
attracting candidates. While this is a fall from our 2022 findings (77%), corresponding
with lower levels of vacancies and higher unemployment, it remains considerably
higher than in 2021 (49%). Senior and skilled positions remain the most difficult to
recruit, particularly in the public sector (52%), although 19% report challenges attracting
low-skilled candidates. At the same time, the proportion with an excessive number of
applicants to process has also increased.

1

Over a quarter (27%) reported challenges with counteroffers or dropouts after offer
acceptance, and 22% experienced challenges onboarding new hires, echoing our
findings above (Figure 29). Creating a positive candidate experience throughout the
recruitment process and ensuring an effective induction process to support and
integrate new hires is clearly important.

2

Up from 16% in 2022, 29% reported challenges hiring diverse talent. In some cases, this
may reflect an increased focus on diversity. Of those that attempted to fill vacancies,
51% say they recruited a more diverse workforce compared with the previous year
(Figure 2), and there have been small improvements in efforts to attract and recruit
diverse candidates. Nevertheless, it is clear that many could take a more robust and
comprehensive approach (Figures 12 and 13).

Recruitment challenges addressed through training and flexible working
Many organisations that have attempted to recruit and experienced recruitment
difficulties in the last year are attempting to address their recruitment difficulties
through training and development (Figure 31). Similar to last year, the most
widespread practice was to upskill existing employees to fill hard-to-fill vacancies.
Other popular options were:
• apprenticeship schemes (51%)
• graduate programmes (45%)
• sponsoring relevant professional qualifications (43%)
• offering mid-career/career-returner programmes (31%).
Offering greater work flexibility is the second most common approach to addressing
recruitment challenges (particularly common in the non-profit sector, as last year). As
noted above, this can be beneficial for both attracting and retaining talent, not least
through opening opportunities to a broader segment of the labour market.
Offering better pay and/or benefits to address recruitment difficulties was the
approach for 41% (from 36% in 2022 and 29% in 2021). This was more common in
the private sector (46%) than in the public (27%) or non-profit (29%) sectors. Private
sector organisations were also most likely to make counteroffers (33%) compared
with public (17%) or non-profit (9%) sector organisations. Inflation and cost-ofliving pressures have contributed to wage increases in recent years. With inflation
now slowing, pay increases will likely follow suit. Nevertheless, with a substantial
proportion of recruiters experiencing challenges attracting candidates and 27%
experiencing counteroffers (Figure 30), a competitive pay and benefits package will
remain important.

9 Talent management and
retention

Nearly half of CEOs prioritise talent management
During the pandemic, talent management fell off the agenda for many CEOs. This
year’s findings suggest it is returning to pre-pandemic levels of attention. Nearly half
(46%) of respondents report their CEO has had talent management as a key priority
over the last 12 months (2022: 38%; 2021: 30%; 2020: 48%). It is disappointing,
however, that 22% disagree that talent management is a key priority for their CEO

Most organisations don’t calculate the cost of labour turnover
Of those who were aware of turnover data, 31% say their organisation calculates the
cost of labour turnover, up from 17% in 2022 (11% don’t know, as in 2022). Larger
organisations remain more likely to calculate the cost (larger organisations: 43%;
SMEs: 18%).
Increase in retention initiatives
An increasing proportion (42%) have taken steps to improve employee retention
(2022: 37%; 2021: 29%). Yet 51% of those that report talent has been more difficult to
retain over the last year have not taken any steps.
Improving support for employee wellbeing and increasing pay remain the most
common focuses of retention initiatives (Figure 33), although the latter was more
common in SMEs (54%) than larger organisations (40%).
A considerable proportion are also making efforts to improve work–life balance,
including through introducing or enhancing flexible or hybrid working options.
Recent CIPD research showed that demand for flexible and hybrid working options
has increased since the pandemic and that an increasing proportion of employees
have left their jobs or changed career due to a lack of flexible working options.
Organisations that find ways to effectively address this demand are likely to
experience a range of benefits that go beyond retaining and attracting talent.
In line with our findings above on responses to recruitment challenges, more
organisations this year report they are taking steps to address retention through
increasing learning and development opportunities (2024: 42%; 2022: 35%), creating
clearer career paths (2024: 31%; 2022: 24%) and better promotion of the employer
brand (2024: 26%; 2022: 16%). Investing in employees, providing clear opportunities
for growth and promotion, and facilitating alignment with the company’s mission
and vision helps foster greater loyalty and engagement, as well as making employees
more proficient in their roles.
There has also been an increase in the proportion of organisations improving the
selection skills of interviewers and the induction/onboarding process. To help with
retention, 35% are offering coaching/mentoring/buddy systems and 40% have

integration into the organisation and providing them with the support they need
demonstrates a commitment to employees’ success and wellbeing.

10 Workforce planning and
data-driven decision-making
Considerable variation in workforce planning timeframes
There remains considerable variation in how far ahead organisations look when
planning and taking action on current and future workforce requirements (Figure 34).
Similar to our last survey, 31% of organisations take a short-term approach (up to six
months), while 18% are planning over two years into the future. Larger organisations
are more likely to have a longer-term outlook than SMEs.

Small increase in data collection for workforce planning
Effective planning requires good-quality information and data. Positive findings
this year show a small increase in the proportion of organisations collecting data
in all of the areas shown in Figure 35, although it is clear that many could take a
more evidence-based approach. Just 38% collect data to identify skills gaps within
the organisation and less than a third attempt to identify future skill requirements
or retention issues. Around one in five assess the availability/supply of talent in
the market, the cost of replacing talent internally versus externally, or the cost of
investing in technology to automate.
A substantial minority (2024: 35%; 2022: 46%) are not collecting data on any of these
topics. Larger organisations are more likely than smaller ones to collect data in all the
areas listed, although 20% of organisations with more than 1,000 employees do not
collect any data.

Small increase in collecting data to inform resourcing decisions
Figure 36 suggests that many organisations could take a more evidence-based
approach to resourcing. Nevertheless, comparison with previous years suggests some
improvement: 31% report they don’t collect data in any of the areas listed, down from
37% in 2022. More organisations are collecting data on the performance of new hires
(2024: 31%; 2022: 24%), the effectiveness of retention initiatives (2024: 20%; 2022: 12%)
and the predictive validity of assessment methods (2024: 12%; 2022: 7%). Nevertheless,
most organisations do not take any of these measures. Larger organisations are
most likely to collect some form of data, although 16% of organisations with 1,000+
employees do not collect data in any of the areas in Figure 36.
As we’ve found in previous years, public sector and non-profits are considerably more
likely than private sector organisations to monitor diversity to inform recruitment
processes (public sector: 43%; non-profits: 41%; private sector: 27%). Private sector
and non-profit organisations are more likely to compare their pay/benefit offering
with competitors (private sector: 31%; non-profits: 38%; public sector: 21%).

Increase in organisations measuring return on investment of recruitment
processes
Almost a quarter (24%) say they measure the return on investment (ROI) of their
recruitment processes, up from 13% in 2022. A further 12% plan to introduce
measures to do this (18% don’t know if they measure ROI or not). Nevertheless,
measuring ROI remains uncommon in the public (7%) and non-profit sectors (7%) as
well as in smaller private sector organisations.

The most common methods used to measure ROI are the performance of new hires
and the turnover rate of new hires (Figure 37). Increasing proportions of respondents
also report they are measuring the engagement of new hires (2024: 47%; 2022: 30%;
2021: 22%). In contrast, fewer this year report they are measuring ROI through cost
per hire (2024: 49%; 2022: 64%; 2021: 62%).

11 Background to the survey

This survey was conducted online from 4–22 April 2024 by YouGov UK plc. In
total, 1,016 UK-based HR/people professionals responded to the survey.
The CIPD Resourcing and talent planning survey (formerly known as the CIPD
Recruitment and retention survey) has been exploring UK organisations’ resourcing
and talent planning practices and challenges since 1997. The last survey, prior to this
one, was conducted in April 2022.

The survey attempts to provide useful benchmarking data while also capturing trends
and developments in resourcing practices and strategy. This year we include new
questions on the impact of UK changes to migration rules for family and work visas
on resourcing and explore in greater detail the use and impact of AI in the resourcing
process, and flexible and hybrid working offerings.

Sample profile
An email link to the online survey was sent to a sample of people from the YouGov
Plc UK panel of 2.5 million+ individuals who have agreed to take part in surveys.
Pre-selection criteria ensured the sample contacted were in senior HR/management
roles with responsibility for resourcing and talent decision-making and represented
employers across the UK in terms of region, organisation size, sector and industry.

1,016 UK-based HR/people professionals responded to the survey. The sample has
been weighted to be representative of UK employers by proportion of employment
within organisation size and sector using official labour market statistics (Table 2). In
places the report includes additional analyses conducted by the CIPD for comparison
with previous years’ findings.

Note on abbreviations, statistics and figures used
Voluntary, community and not-for-profit organisations are referred to throughout the
report as ‘non-profits’.
‘SMEs’ (small and medium-sized enterprises) refers to organisations with up to 249
permanent employees (excluding sole traders, who did not take part in the survey
due to relevance). ‘Larger organisations’ refers to organisations with 250 or more
permanent employees unless otherwise stated.
The median is used instead of the statistical mean in cases where the distribution is
significantly skewed or there are extreme outliers.
Except for labour turnover rates, all figures in tables and figures have been rounded
to the nearest percentage point. Because of rounding, percentages shown may not
always total 100.
