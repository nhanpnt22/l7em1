Labour Market Outlook Winter 2024–25

1 Foreword from the CIPD
The quarterly CIPD Labour Market Outlook (LMO) provides an early indication of
future changes to the labour market around recruitment, redundancy and pay
intentions. The findings are based on a survey of more than 2,000 employers.
Employer confidence, signified by the net employment balance, is at its lowest on
record outside of the pandemic. It had its second largest quarter-on-quarter fall since
we began collecting this metric in 2014, the largest being the onset of the pandemic.
It fell across all sectors and, apart from in 2020, is at its lowest level in the private
sector on record.
The change in the net employment balance is being driven by the rise in employers
who expect a decrease in their total staff levels in the next three months. Last quarter
11% of employers were expecting a decrease, but this figure now stands at 16%. One
in four (25%) employers are planning to make redundancies in the three months to
March 2025, another record high outside of 2020.
Between quarters we have seen a major fiscal event, the Autumn Budget 2024.
Two-fifths of employers believe changes to National Insurance (NI), announced by
Chancellor Rachel Reeves, will increase their employment costs to a large extent.
These tax hikes, to fund increases in spending in public services, are likely to
have inflationary and employment effects, echoed by the recent Bank of England
Monetary Policy Report. Forty-two per cent of employers in our survey plan to raise
prices because of these increased employment costs, with 68% of retailers and
59% of employers in hospitality opting for this response. The impact on hiring can
be seen by the third of employers who plan to reduce the number of employees
through redundancies and/or recruiting fewer workers, because of these increased
employment costs. Employers also plan to reduce the amount of overtime/bonuses
and reduce the hours worked by staff.
Troublingly, one in four employers expect to cancel or scale down plans for investing
in or expanding their business. This is particularly pertinent among private sector
SMEs. One in five organisations also plan to cut back on training expenditure. Lack
of investment in business goes against the UK Government’s
growth agenda, and low investment in people and skills is
likely to have longer-lasting impacts, creating skills gaps
and making the UK a less attractive place to invest. Our data
suggests, however, that the investment in public services may
ease recruitment and retention difficulties in the longer term.
Read on for our latest labour market data and analysis on
employers’ recruitment, redundancy and pay intentions this
winter.

2 Key points

• The net employment balance suffered
the heaviest fall on record outside of the
pandemic – from +21 last quarter to +13 this
quarter. This measures the difference between
employers expecting there will be an increase
in staff levels and those expecting there will be
a decrease in the next three months.

• The net employment balance fell sharply in
the private sector from +24 last quarter to +16
this quarter. Apart from in 2020, this is the
lowest net employment balance in the private
sector since the time series began in 2014.

Private sector confidence plummets

• One in four (25%) employers are planning to
make redundancies in the next three months.
This is the highest level recorded in a decade,
with the exception of the pandemic.
One in four plan redundancies

• Many employers believe measures in the
Budget will be costly for them – two in five
employers believe the increase in the rate of
National Insurance contributions (NICs), and
the reduction in the ‘secondary threshold’,
will increase their employment costs to a
large extent.

Costs

Employment cost spike expected by many

• In response to increased employment
costs, 42% of employers who report their
organisation will be impacted plan to raise
prices. A third (32%) of employers plan to
reduce the number of employees through
redundancies and/or recruiting fewer
workers.

• The median expected basic pay increase
remains at 3%. Expected pay awards in the next

voluntary sectors (both at 3%) but have fallen
in the public sector from 4% to 2.5%.

3 Recruitment and

redundancy outlook
The net employment balance – the difference between employers expecting there
will be an increase in staff levels and those expecting there will be a decrease in staff
levels in the next three months – has fallen from +21 last quarter to +13 this quarter.
This represents the largest quarterly fall in over a decade outside of the pandemic.
Since the previous quarter we have had the Autumn Budget 2024. This major fiscal
event has had a notable impact on employer confidence.
Despite the proposed £70bn a year injection into the public sector, the net
employment balance remains low at +3. While employment intentions are lowest in
the public sector, they have fallen sharply in the private sector from +24 last quarter
to +16 this quarter. This too was the lowest on record, with the exception of the
pandemic. This sharp fall was also evident in the voluntary sector, which fell from +21
last quarter to +6 this quarter.

There is a rise in employers who expect a decrease in their total staff levels in the
next three months. Last quarter 11% of employers expected a decrease, but this figure
now stands at 16%. There has also been a fall in employers who expect an increase
in staff levels, from 32% to 29%. Half of all employers believe their staff levels will be
maintained in the next three months (Figure 2).

Base: winter 2024/25, all employers (total: n=2,019).

Figure 3 shows that for all types of employer, the proportion expecting a decrease in
staff levels has risen, most notably among SMEs and large private sector employers.
Last quarter, just 7% of SMEs said they expected a decrease in their staff levels over
the next three months. This has almost doubled to 13% this quarter. For large private
sector employers, that proportion rose from 12% last quarter to 17% this quarter. One
in five (20%) public sector employers expect a decrease in staff levels over the next
three months, the highest of all types of employer. Notably the proportion of SMEs
who expect an increase in staff levels has also fallen, from 28% to 24%.

Sector and employment size
Base: winter 2024/25 (public sector: n=360; private sector SME: n=996; private sector large (250+): n=513).

The net employment balance has fallen in a number of industries this quarter, with
the retail sector hardest hit.
Each of the following industries suffered a significant fall in the net employment balance,
driven by a rise in the proportion of employers who believe their staff levels will decrease:
• retail: +23 to +1
• arts, entertainment and recreation: +10 to +2
• hotels, catering and restaurants (hospitality): +18 to +7
• transport and storage: +28 to +11
• administrative and support service activities and other service activities: +29 to +15
• primary and utilities: +37 to +22
• construction: +43 to +27.
Last quarter, just 1% of employers in construction believed their staff levels would
decrease in the next three months. Despite the UK Government outlining largescale housing and infrastructure plans in the last quarter, one in 10 employers in
construction now believe there will be a fall in staff levels over the coming period.
As per previous quarters, the net employment balance remains below zero (−4)
among public administration and other public sector employers. There is a low net
employment balance in both education categories. It is +4 among employers in
compulsory education, which includes primary and secondary education, and 0
among non-compulsory education, which includes vocational and higher education
institutions. This means the same proportion of employers believe their staff levels
will increase as believe levels will decrease in the next three months.

Redundancies
Overall, a quarter of employers plan to make redundancies in the three months to
March 2025 (see Figure 6). This is a significant increase from 21% last quarter and is
the highest level recorded in a decade, with the exception of the pandemic. It rose
sharply in the private sector from 22% last quarter to 27% this quarter – the highest
of all sectors. It also rose in the public sector, from 20% to 23%, and in the voluntary
sector, from 14% to 20%.

Base: winter 2024/25, all employers (total: n=2,019; private: n=1,509; public: n=360; voluntary: n=150).

Autumn Budget 2024
Much of the change in employment intentions detailed above can be attributed to
the measures introduced in the Autumn Budget 2024 affecting employers, which
are set to come into force in April this year. Changes to employer National Insurance
Contributions (NICs) were announced, alongside changes to the National Living
Wage (NLW) and business rates, among other measures.
From April 2025, the employer rate of NICs will rise from 13.8% to 15%. The rate at
which an employer has to pay NICs on employee earnings will also decrease from
£9,100 to £5,000. This is what is known as the ‘secondary threshold’. Almost nine
in 10 employers believe their employment costs will increase because of these two
measures. Forty-three per cent of employers believe the increase in the rate of NICs
will increase their employment costs to a large extent. Forty per cent of employers
believe the reduction in the ‘secondary threshold’ will increase their employment
costs to a large extent.
As expected, there was also an announcement regarding an increase to the NLW.
One in four (24%) employers believe their employment costs will increase to a large
extent due to the rise in NLW to £12.21. In our autumn 2024 LMO, when the NLW
was expected to rise to £12.10, 20% believed it would increase their employment
costs to a large extent.
Fifty-seven per cent of employers say their employment costs will increase due to
the changes in business rates, with 18% of employers reporting this will be to a large

extent. This is higher among employers in transport and storage (35%), hospitality
(34%) and retail (28%), with the latter two industries having their rate of relief reduced
from 75% to 40% up to a maximum discount of £110,000 per business. Relief to these
firms was introduced to mitigate the effect of the pandemic.

In addition, the eligibility threshold for employers to benefit from the Employment
Allowance, which previously was set at £100,000, will be removed. Fifty-two per
cent of small firms believe these measures will reduce their employment costs,
but 5% say it will decrease them to a large extent. As stated in the Employment
Allowance statistics, the vast majority of firms who benefit are micro employers (2–9
employees).1 Among these micro firms, a third (33%) said these changes would not
reduce their employment costs.

Base: winter 2024/25, all small firms (total: n=867; 2–9 employees: n=404; 10–49 employees: n=463).

We regularly ask how employers will deal with increased employment costs due
to the rises in the NLW. Commonly, employers in low-wage sectors opt for raising
prices, absorbing higher costs through lower profits, increasing productivity (such as
requiring staff to take on extra tasks) or employing fewer people.
As a result of the Budget measures, 42% of employers who report their organisation
will be impacted to some extent by additional employment costs plan to raise prices.
In its initial forecast, the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) estimated that Budget
policies will increase CPI inflation by 0.4 percentage points in 2025–26. In the tax
year, it assumes firms pass on 60% of the higher costs to workers and consumers, via
lower wages and higher prices, leaving 40% to be absorbed by the employer in lower
post-tax profits. Our data suggests only 22% of employers plan to absorb the costs
and take lower profits. The OBR plans to deliver revised forecasts for the UK economy
on 26 March.
The next most common response to increased employment costs (by 37% of
employers) is planning to improve efficiency and raising productivity. The impact on
hiring and labour demand because of these increased employment costs can be seen
by the third (32%) of employers who plan to reduce the number of employees through
redundancies and/or recruiting fewer workers . Employers also plan to reduce the
amount of overtime/bonuses (23%) and reduce the hours worked by staff (14%).
One in four (24%) employers expect to cancel or scale down plans for investing in
or expanding their business. This is particularly pertinent among private sector SMEs
(29%). Employers also plan to cut back on future employee costs by reducing the rate
of basic pay growth (21%) and other aspects of the reward package (16%).
As a result of the Budget, one in five (19%) firms plan to cut back on training
expenditure, something which is evidenced to have positive productivity effects,
particularly important in a time of skills shortages.

Figure 9 disguises the responses that employers in different industries are planning
to take. For example, over two-thirds of retailers (68%) and a large proportion of
employers in construction and hospitality (61% and 59% respectively) plan to raise
prices. As highlighted by the Bank of England, this is likely to have inflationary effects.
Employers in construction (54%) and manufacturing (52%) plan to improve efficiency
and raise productivity at the highest rate. Employers in retail (34%) and hospitality
(33%), whose employment costs are set to disproportionately rise due to the changes
announced, plan to improve efficiency and raise productivity at a rate closer to the
average for all employers (37%). Three in 10 (29%) employers in retail and hospitality
(34%) are planning to cancel or scale down plans for investing in or expanding the
business as a result of these increased employment costs.
Due to the higher rate of hard-to-fill vacancies (see Figure 12), employers in
construction are less likely to be taking steps to reduce staff levels. Just 17% of
employers plan to reduce the number of employees through redundancies and/
or recruiting fewer workers in this industry, compared with 45% of employers in

hospitality. In addition, only 7% of employers in construction plan to reduce the
number of hours worked by staff, compared with 46% of firms in hospitality.
Instead, firms in construction (31%) and manufacturing (34%) plan to introduce or
increase automation at a higher rate than average (21%). They also plan to recruit
more apprentices (30% and 19% respectively).
Public sector employers, such as those in compulsory education, are restricted in
their ability to respond by raising prices and changing investment plans. Instead, a
higher proportion plan to reduce the number of employees through redundancies
and/or recruiting fewer workers (39%) and cutting back on training expenditure
(32%). These responses are also more common in other types of education, including
higher education. Firms who could utilise recent advances in generative AI to
introduce or increase automation, for example those in compulsory education, do
not plan to do so at a notable rate (9%).
See Appendix 1 for the full set of responses by industry.

The reason given for the increase in taxation was to allow the UK Government to
invest in public services. The public sector is acutely aware of the recruitment and
retention challenges it faces, and some of this funding is designed to ease these
difficulties. Looking forward to the next three years, 58% of public sector employers
believe this additional funding will help improve recruitment difficulties, with a similar
proportion (56%) reporting it will help with retention difficulties. Seven per cent of
public sector employers believe it will improve recruitment and retention difficulties
to a large extent going forward.

4 Job vacancies
Official data published in mid-January 2025 showed that overall vacancy levels have
fallen each month for the past two and a half years.2 Figure 11 shows the proportion
of employers with hard-to-fill vacancies has fallen slightly over this time period.
Among the surveyed respondents, a third had hard-to-fill vacancies in the latest
quarter. Hard-to-fill vacancies are significantly higher in the public sector (45%) than
the private sector (31%).

5 Pay outlook
Among employers looking to increase, decrease or freeze pay in the next 12 months, the
median expected basic pay increase for the next 12 months remains at 3% overall, for
the third consecutive quarter. Expected pay awards held at a historic high of 5% between
winter 2022/23 and autumn 2023, before falling to 4% in winter 2023/24 and spring 2024.
Expected pay awards in the public sector, for the year ahead, have fallen to 2.5% this
quarter. They had risen sharply in the public sector from 2.5% in our summer 2024
report to 4% in our autumn 2024 report. This was due to Chancellor Rachel Reeves’
announcement of pay rises for a number of public sector workers in late July. This was
in part to settle ongoing pay disputes, for example in the NHS.
Median expected pay awards remain at 3% in the private sector overall and among both
SMEs and larger private sector organisations. This rate is the same as in the voluntary sector.
To put the median expected pay awards into context, the Consumer Prices Index
including owner occupiers’ housing costs (CPIH), the Office for National Statistics’
(ONS) preferred measure of inflation, currently stands at 3.5%. The Consumer Prices
Index (CPI), which the Bank of England benchmarks against, stands at 2.5%.
It should be noted that the average basic pay award covered in this analysis is only one
component of pay growth. Many people will also benefit from incremental progression
or promotion, bonuses or a pay bump when switching jobs.

Average expected pay awards remain at 3%, but fall to 2.5% in the public sector

6 Recommendations for
employers and people
practitioners

 Take a long-term approach to decision-making and avoid knee-jerk reactions

to acute trends and developments. Aligning with your business objectives, take
a proactive approach to workforce planning and assess both your current and
future skills needs, revising your strategy as necessary.

 Invest in developing your workforce and prioritise continuous learning and

training to enhance adaptability, productivity and employee retention, particularly
if your organisation has to make do with less.

 Take advantage of technology and use it to empower your workforce. Leverage
automation and digital tools including AI to improve efficiency, streamline
processes and operations, to augment and extend the capability of your
workforce.

 If downsizing is unavoidable, follow our best practice redundancy guidance,
ensuring fairness, legal compliance and alternative solutions, such as
redeployment, job-sharing, short-time working, and so on, where possible.
