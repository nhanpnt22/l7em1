IMF Executive Board Concludes 2024 Article IV Consultation with
Vietnam
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
Washington, DC – September 27, 2024: The Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded on August 30 the 2024 Article IV Consultation 1 with Vietnam.
In the challenging year of 2023, the Vietnamese economy grew by 5 percent thanks to determined
actions by the government. The economy was hit by turbulence in the real estate sector, financial
distress, and a significant drop in exports. A recovery began in late 2023, fueled by a rebound in exports,
tourism, and appropriately expansionary fiscal and monetary policy support. Inflation picked up in 2024,
driven mainly by rising food prices, though core inflation remained relatively low and stable. The external
current account posted a large surplus in 2023, at 5.8 percent of GDP, mainly reflecting a significant
contraction in imports.
Economic growth is projected to recover to 6.1 percent in 2024, supported by continued strong external
demand, resilient foreign direct investment, and accommodative policies. Domestic demand growth is
expected to recover gradually as corporates navigate through high debt levels while the real estate
sector will only fully recover over the medium term. Inflation is expected to hover around the State Bank
of Vietnam’s target of 4-4.5 percent this year.
Downside risks are high. Exports, a key driver for Vietnam’s economy, could weaken if global growth
disappoints, global geopolitical tensions persist, or trade disputes intensify. Given easy monetary
conditions, if exchange rate pressures were to persist for longer, it could lead to a larger pass-through to
domestic inflation. Persistent weakness in the real estate sector and corporate bond market could weigh
more than expected on banks’ ability to expand credit, hurting economic growth and undermining
financial stability.

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members, usually every
year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses with officials the
country's economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms
the basis for discussion by the Executive Board.

Executive Board Assessment22F 2
Executive Directors commended the authorities’ swift actions to maintain macro-financial stability as the
economic recovery from the pandemic faced domestic and external headwinds. They noted that risks
remain elevated, and that further efforts are required to safeguard macro-financial stability and deepen
reforms to address vulnerabilities and ensure robust, green, and inclusive growth over the medium term.
Continued capacity development will be important to support reforms.
Directors noted that, given ample fiscal space and limited room for monetary policy loosening, fiscal
policy should take the lead in supporting economic activity if needed. In this context, Directors welcomed
the authorities’ plans to speed up the implementation of public investment, which will require tackling
bottlenecks, and stressed the importance of expanding social safety nets to support the most vulnerable.
Directors recommended strengthening the fiscal framework and budget process and increasing revenue
mobilization over the medium term to support the ambitious development agenda.
Directors commended the authorities for effectively containing inflation risks but stressed that monetary
policy should continue to be cautious under a complex environment and limited policy space. They
welcomed steps toward greater exchange rate flexibility and encouraged continued progress in this area,
along with modernizing the monetary policy framework.
Directors underscored the importance of strengthening the resilience of the financial system by bolstering
capital buffers, phasing out regulatory forbearance, and addressing rising non-performing loans. They
also stressed the need to enhance the authorities’ toolkit to prevent and manage banking crises by
strengthening the resolution and emergency liquidity frameworks, and welcomed the ongoing revision of
the law on credit institutions. Efforts to strengthen bank regulation and supervision should continue.
Directors acknowledged the authorities’ swift actions to contain risks in the real estate and corporate
bond market. They urged decisive steps to address remaining risks, including by strengthening the
insolvency framework, bolstering institutions, and increasing transparency in the corporate bond market.
Directors stressed the importance of structural and climate reforms to achieve sustainable, green, and
inclusive growth. Accelerating the transition to upper-middle income status will require further efforts to
improve the business environment, step-up critical infrastructure, and invest in human capital. Directors

welcomed the latest Power Development Plan and the planned Emissions Trading System to help
achieve Vietnam’s climate goals and promote energy security. They emphasized the importance of
moving ahead with implementation of the strategy and developing the appropriate regulatory framework
to promote investment in renewable energy and secure funding for the green transition. Conducting a
Climate-Public Investment Management Assessment would be useful.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ anti-corruption efforts and emphasized the need to continue
strengthening governance, improving the AML/CFT framework, and simplifying regulatory frameworks.
Greater efforts in closing data gaps will be important.

STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2024 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION

KEY ISSUES
Context. Adverse external and domestic shocks led to a sharp slowdown in early 2023,
but economic growth is gaining momentum thanks to a strong rebound in exports and
expansionary fiscal and monetary policies. However, risks remain elevated, including
because of a weak real estate sector and leveraged corporates. Headline inflation
accelerated mostly owing to food prices. Despite a large current account surplus, the
currency has been depreciating amidst record low domestic interest rates.
Recommendations. Policies will need to balance support to the recovery while
managing inflation risks and strengthening the resilience of the financial system. The
complex global and domestic environment highlights the importance of upgrading
policy frameworks. Sustaining high medium-term growth will require further progress
on structural reforms to raise productivity growth and accelerate the climate agenda.
•

Monetary policy. As the recovery strengthens, monetary policy should stand ready
to tighten if inflation pressures intensify. Accelerating the modernization of the
monetary policy framework would strengthen policy transmission, reduce credit
distortions, and safeguard FX reserve buffers for large shocks. Key steps include
providing operational autonomy to SBV, allowing greater exchange rate flexibility,
and enhancing macroprudential policies.

•

Fiscal policy. The fiscal stimulus is helping sustain domestic demand, including
investment, which facilitates private sector deleveraging. However, fiscal support
may need to be scaled down if there was a large inflation surprise. An upgraded
fiscal framework would help improve public policies and manage challenges ahead.

•

Financial sector. The implementation of the revised law on credit institutions will
help strengthen financial stability. However, further actions are needed to tackle the
still high vulnerabilities and improve the balance sheet of banks and corporates,
while phasing out NPL forbearance. Reforms on bank supervision, bank resolution,
insolvency framework, and AML/CFT remain a priority.

•

Structural and climate policies. Sustaining high medium-term economic growth,
amidst demographic and climate headwinds, requires broader structural reforms to
boost productivity, address climate challenges, and strengthen governance.

CONTEXT AND RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS
1.
Economic growth in Vietnam outpaced most peers over the last two decades but
has become more volatile since the
pandemic. The economy was hit by large
external and domestic shocks in recent years. A
post-pandemic boom was quickly reversed
amid global interest rates hikes, weakened
external demand, financial sector disruptions,
following the failure of the fifth largest bank in
late 2022, and turbulence in the real estate and
corporate bond markets—leading to a sharp
slowdown in early 2023.
2.
External conditions, crucial to the
export-led growth strategy, have been a key
source of recent bouts of volatility. After
surging in 2022, trade collapsed in 2023—
exports and imports as a share of GDP fell by
more than 9 and 12 percentage points,
respectively—and the current account reached
a historical surplus of 5.8 percent of GDP.
Nevertheless, as other currencies in the region,
the Vietnamese dong has been depreciating
against the US dollar since mid-2023. Falling
domestic interest rates opened a large gap with
US rates and exacerbated the depreciation
pressures.

3.
The economic recovery is gaining
momentum, but some fragilities remain.
Growth rebounded in the second half of 2023
thanks to large policy support, including
measures to stabilize the banking sector, and
higher external demand. Domestic activity
has been recovering at a slower pace given
the still-weak real estate sector, as sales of
new homes remain depressed, and leveraged
corporates. In the first half of 2024, economic
growth rose to 6.4 percent, supported by
robust exports, increased tourism, and
resilient FDI.

VIETNAM

4.
Both expansionary monetary and fiscal policies are boosting economic activity.
State Bank of Vietnam (SBV) loosened monetary policy from early 2023 and injected significant
liquidity, as it took over the failed Sai Gon Commercial Bank (SCB), leading interbank rates close
to zero. As FX depreciation pressures increased in early 2024, SBV reduced liquidity in the
interbank market and conducted FX interventions (FXI) to stabilize the exchange rate (ER) and
contain the pass-through to domestic prices. Headline inflation accelerated to 4.3 percent y/y in
June 2024 driven by food prices, but core
inflation remains low. The fiscal balance went
from a surplus (0.7 percent of GDP) in 2022 to a
2.5 percent of GDP deficit in 2023 reflecting
both a large fall in revenues—due to the real
estate downturn, the imports’ contraction, and
cuts in taxes—and rising expenditures in the
second half of 2023. Public wages increased by
21 percent in July 2023 and public investment
jumped, reflecting disbursements under the
COVID-related Program of Recovery and
Development (PRD). Public debt remained stable, at 34½ percent of GDP in 2023, benefiting
from low interest rates.
5.
The actions of the government helped quickly stabilize the financial system and
boost credit in late 2023, but vulnerabilities remain (Box 1). Credit growth surged in late
2023 (13.7 percent in 2023), decelerating slightly in early 2024, 1 while non-performing loans
(NPLs) reached the highest level in a decade,
partly due to SCB, and firms continue to
struggle with high debt. After freezing in late
2022, the corporate bond market is gradually
recovering following policies to facilitate
payment deferrals and bond restructuring—
involving to a large degree real estate
developers. The slow restructuring of leveraged
firms remains a source of risk for financial
markets.

1
The surge in credit at the end of 2023 in part reflects efforts by banks to reach their credit ceilings set by SBV to
preserve market share in 2024. Some of these loans have very short maturities and low or no profit margins.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

VIETNAM

Box 1. Credit, Economic Growth, and Financial Risks
Availability of affordable credit has been one of the pillars of Vietnam’s economic development
strategy, but at times involved significant turbulence.
Credit in Vietnam grew at a fast pace over the last decade
and is well above peer average, reaching almost 130
percent of GDP in 2023. As noted in the 2023 Article IV
Staff Report, the GDP loss from financial distress can be
large, as was the case with the banking crisis in the early
2010s and the financial distress in 2022.
The authorities’ actions helped contain the risks from
the SCB failure, but the still-high vulnerabilities
require attention. In particular:

•

Estimates of the credit gap—deviation of the creditto-GDP ratio from its long-term trend—show a
growing positive gap. Such an uptick in the credit gap
resembles the increase seen in 2022H1 although
below the distress period of 2010-12.

•

NPLs have been rising, with some banks especially
vulnerable due to real estate sector exposures. Total
NPLs, including restructured loans and those held by
Vietnam Asset Management Company (VAMC),
reached 7.9 percent of total loans in March 2024. Onbalance sheet NPLs, rose from 2.4 percent at end2022 to 5.7 percent, but excluding banks under SBV
control (especially SCB), NPLs reached around 3
percent.

•

Corporates, especially in the real estate sector, remain vulnerable given their high leverage and
interconnectedness. Among listed firms, the share of corporate debt accounted by firms with interest
coverage ratios below 1 increased significantly in recent years—the largest increase among peer countries
(April 2024 Asia-Pacific Regional Economic Outlook). Risks are amplified by weaknesses in debt
restructuring processes and shortcomings in insolvency procedures.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

VIETNAM

OUTLOOK AND RISKS
6.
Economic growth is expected to accelerate in 2024 and inflation to remain close to
the target; however, medium-term growth prospects face headwinds. Growth is projected to
reach 6.1 percent in 2024-25, as the output gap closes, thanks to continued robust external
demand and accommodative monetary and fiscal policies. The real estate and construction
sectors should rebound over time benefiting from measures to overcome supply bottlenecks,
incentives for affordable housing, and public investment. Inflation is expected to hover around
the 4-4.5 percent target, and the current account surplus to decline as import compression
subsides. Over the medium term, the economy will face less favorable demographics and
historical lessons from peers suggest that potential growth will decline without reforms to boost
productivity (Annex V).

7.
Vietnam’s prospects also rely on remaining an attractive FDI destination amidst
global trade tensions. The FDI-based exports have been, and are expected to remain, a key
pillar of the growth strategy. In recent years, Vietnam’s share in global FDI has risen along with
countries in the region despite a decline in global FDI since 2020. In part, this reflects interest by
foreign investors (including Chinese firms) in the growing domestic market. Vietnam, due to
rising geoeconomic fragmentation, has seen some trade and FDI reallocation with foreign
investors moving production to Vietnam—e.g., the share of domestic value added in its exports
to the US surged in 2018. However, given trade tensions, Vietnam has enhanced monitoring to
avoid serving as a connector country to reroute Chinese goods to the US to circumvent trade
barriers (Annex VI). Additional trade tensions, however, could have a negative impact on trade
and FDI, including through protectionist measures directly targeted at Vietnam.

8.
The outlook remains uncertain, with elevated downside risks (Annex III).
Households and domestic firms may be reluctant to scale up consumption or investment amid
continued uncertainty and vulnerabilities:
•

Weaker than expected external demand (US, China), intensification of existing regional
conflicts (e.g., Ukraine, Middle East), and volatility in commodity prices could disrupt the

recovery. Other risks include natural disasters and other negative effects from climate
change.
•

Higher-for-longer global interest rates along with accommodative monetary policy could
accelerate depreciation, leading to inflation pressures and weaker consumption.

•

Financial distress could reemerge. Rising NPLs and decreasing credit quality, combined with
liquidity pressures and relatively low capital ratios, could reduce banks’ capacity to provide
credit to the economy. Corporate indebtedness and interconnected lending involving
business groups remain a risk for banks and investors.

Authorities’ Views
9.
The authorities broadly agreed with staff’s overall assessment and are confident
economic growth can reach 6-6.5 percent for 2024, while keeping inflation in line with the
target. They concurred that in addition to the rebound in external demand and resilient FDI,
significant policy efforts boosted domestic activity in late 2023 through low interest rates and
fiscal expansion, including accelerating implementation of public investment and increasing
public wages. Supportive policies continue in 2024, including to boost credit growth and through
increases in public wages and pensions. Nevertheless, the authorities agreed there are risks,
especially amid a more volatile and uncertain global environment. In the context of difficult
international developments (high US interest rates; USD appreciation) causing great pressure on
the ER and foreign exchange market, SBV has both flexibly managed the ER, supporting the
absorption of external shocks; and regulated VND liquidity to narrow the VND-USD interest rate
gap, thereby limiting increased pressure on the ER.

POLICY DISCUSSION
10.
While the economy is recovering, there was a broad agreement that further policy
actions are needed to sustain economic growth and reduce vulnerabilities. Discussions
centered around balancing support for the recovery, amidst a still-weak real estate sector and
leveraged corporates, while managing inflation risks and continuing to restore banking system
health. Upgrading monetary and fiscal policy frameworks would help manage a complex
environment and promote macro-financial stability. Sustaining high medium-term growth,
amidst significant challenges (aging, climate), will require further structural reforms. Governance
reforms that complement the anti-corruption drive would help reduce short-term uncertainties
and cement long-term gains.

VIETNAM

A. Monetary and Exchange Rate Policy
11.
Monetary policy will need to carefully balance supporting the economic recovery,
while managing inflation risks and strengthening financial stability. The accommodative
monetary policy stance has helped the economy rebound as policy rates have remained near
record lows since the second half of 2023, the real policy rate is close to zero, and NPL
forbearance was extended to end-2024 to
boost credit growth. As the recovery is
gaining momentum, the focus should turn
to closely monitoring inflation risks.
Policies that incentivize credit should be
avoided as they can lead to excessive,
unproductive, credit expansion and fuel
inflation and rising NPLs. Given the
accommodative policy stance, ER
depreciation pressures have increased the
risk of increasing pass-through to
domestic inflation. Moreover, rising public
and minimum wages and pensions, as
well as expected further increases in administrative prices, could put additional pressure on
inflation in the remainder of the year and 2025. 2 If inflation pressures intensify, policy rates would
need to be raised swiftly.

The recent intensification of FX pressures further highlights the complex policy
tradeoffs faced by the authorities. ER flexibility has generally increased, especially since the
widening of the ER band to ±5% in 2022. But depreciation pressures since late 2023 prompted

addition to policy rates, SBV uses a variety of instruments, including FXI and credit ceilings for
the banking sector to steer monetary policy that have costs and can lead to inefficiencies.
Moreover, the multiplicity of objectives limits clarity in communications and the effectiveness of
monetary policy. The forthcoming revision of the SBV law is an opportunity to accelerate the
move towards an inflation targeting regime and allowing for greater ER flexibility, while
safeguarding FX reserve buffers to help manage large external shocks (SIP chapter and Box 2).
Measures to support the reforms include:
•

Enhancing SBV’s operational independence to achieve its policy goals while retaining the
government and National Assembly’s responsibilities in setting the policy goals.

•

Streamlining the monetary policy toolkit, improving its consistency, and incorporating
forward-looking elements into the framework. This includes establishing an interest rate
corridor with a floor rate by introducing a deposit facility, further increasing ER flexibility, and
developing a communication strategy to better anchor inflation expectations.

•

Phasing out deposit and lending (shortterm) rate caps and credit growth ceilings—
which, instead of limiting credit growth, in
recent years have incentivized banks to
extend credit to not lose their quota. Banks’
efforts to meet the ceiling could create
distortions such as supporting unproductive
sectors and weakening balance sheets.

•

Strengthening SBV’s legal and institutional
framework to manage risks, including
macroprudential policies, would facilitate
the removal of credit ceilings. This includes introducing an enhanced macroprudential toolkit
to mitigate systemic risks (e.g., countercyclical capital buffers, loan-to-value or debt-toincome limits on borrowers) and strengthening bank supervision.

Authorities’ Views
14.
SBV noted the difficult tradeoffs it is facing as it pursues key policy goals. Recent
policies are intended to achieve SBV’s priority objective of ensuring price stability while
supporting domestic demand and helping firms manage high debt levels in the aftermath of
Covid-19. The authorities noted they are working towards developing a modern monetary policy
framework with the help of the Fund. SBV stressed they allowed greater ER flexibility in recent
years, but need to avoid excessive volatility that could destabilize markets and inflation
expectations. Further, they noted that removing the credit ceilings, while desirable, needs to be
done with caution and conditional on alternative safeguards to prevent excessive credit growth.
The authorities welcomed the discussion of the IPF but emphasized that FX market shallowness,
history of dollarization, and weak interest rate transmission channel made it necessary to use FXI
during the transition to a new monetary policy framework.

Box 2. Tackling External Shocks and FX Pressures
The IMF’s integrated policy framework (IPF) offers a lens to
weigh the benefits of FXI in the presence of specific
country characteristics, frictions, and large external shocks
against the costs of frequent FXI. The ER served for years as
a nominal anchor. As the transition to a more flexible ER and
inflation targeting regime is ongoing, FXI is expected to be
more limited, to increase the credibility of the new monetary
policy framework and help deepen FX markets. FXI could be
considered following large temporary non-fundamental shocks
that exacerbate key IPF frictions (SIP chapter).
Vietnam suffers from structurally shallow FX markets.
Market shallowness shows up in persistently positive
Uncovered Interest Rate Parity (UIP) premia and large bid-ask
spreads. Large changes in these premia can hamper market
liquidity as in 2022. Costly currency financing and hedging
premia to firms can then spill over to real activity. Monetary
policy alone may not restore FX market liquidity or may need
to tighten too much with adverse economic effects. Instead,
FXI can step in to address FX shortages and close premia.
Proxy FXI data suggest SBV has been leaning against large
premia but also intervened in other episodes during 2009-2023
(partly reflecting the role of the ER as anchor in the past).
Private sector currency mismatches are low and inflation
expectations appear anchored, but risks persist. Lack of
granular data masks potential unhedged debt stocks or cash
flows. For example, Vietnamese firms could become more
financially constrained if they cannot offset foreign currency
payments on imports with equivalent receipts on exports. In
addition, ER pass-through to consumer prices is assessed to be
low in normal times but more sizable following large
depreciations (2023 Article IV). In the case of a large shock,
inflation expectations may become unanchored and monetary
policy alone may not be able to bring expectations under
control without creating severe trade-offs across SBV’s
objectives (especially during the transition to the new
monetary policy framework).
Lessons can be drawn from the financial distress and FXI in
2022. Vietnam started facing FX pressures in February 2022,
intensified by US monetary tightening. Reserves steadily
declined during Q1-Q3, while monetary policy was loose
during the first half of 2023. When the distress in the financial
and real estate sectors became more pronounced, around 20
percent of FX reserves had been used. The episode illustrates
the intertemporal trade-off of using FXI when the duration and
size of shocks are uncertain and there are concerns about financial vulnerabilities.

B. Fiscal Policy
15.
After a large countercyclical stimulus in 2023, fiscal policy is expected to remain
supportive in 2024. The fiscal deficit is projected to rise slightly to 2.6 percent of GDP, reflecting
wage and pension increases which, in turn, are largely offset by a rebound in revenues—as the
economy and imports recover. In 2025, the deficit is expected to fall as tax revenues continue to
recover to past levels with a healthier economy, including the real estate sector, and expiring tax
cuts. 3 With public debt well below the 60 percent of GDP ceiling and low debt risks (Annex IX),
the fiscal expansion is helping sustain the domestic demand and facilitating private sector
deleveraging. The 30 percent increase in public wages in 2024 (on the back of a large increase in
2023), with an annual cost estimated at 1.6 percent of GDP over 2024-25, will help reduce the
gap between private and public sector wages. However, it highlights the need for a mediumterm remuneration and hiring strategy with gradual wage increases, that would avoid fueling
inflation and crowding out other priority spending, while attracting a qualified and professional
workforce.
16.
Fiscal policy will need to remain agile to manage different risks. If inflation surprises
significantly on the upside, limiting or reversing the fiscal accommodation would help support
monetary policy and avoid amplifying further inflation risks. The government could delay
implementation of projects or expansion of programs and develop contingency measures for
2025. If downside risks to growth materialize, there is
ample fiscal space to accelerate investment and support
the most vulnerable. In addition, to safeguard financial
stability, targeted (limited) support could be considered—
with appropriate governance arrangements—to help
facilitate restructuring real estate developers.
17.
Strengthening the fiscal framework and
enhancing revenue mobilization would help address
medium-term challenges, improve the quality of
policies, and manage risks. Over the medium term,
Vietnam will have to tackle various challenges, including
optimizing the composition of spending (e.g., size of the
wage bill, public investment) to promote better and more
efficient public services, managing the medium- to longterm implications of aging and climate change, and
enhancing the ability to respond to shocks (automatic

stabilizers have played a limited role reflecting weak social safety nets). 4 Moving forward with
reforms can help achieve those goals:
•

Upgrade the medium-term fiscal framework and the budget process. The 2024 World Bank
Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability report flags weaknesses in public finances
transparency, fiscal risk reporting, and public investment management. Improvements in
these areas, including projections and the coverage in the budget, would help increase fiscal
transparency and support Vietnam’s efforts to improve the government bond market and
attract more investors.

•

Continue efforts to improve social safety nets by increasing their adequacy and coverage and
ensuring well-targeted, timely, and cost-effective support measures, while also building
institutional capacity to respond to large shocks. It will also be important to strengthen the
long-term sustainability of the pension system (see below) as the population starts aging.

•

Adopt revenue-enhancing reforms to address the challenges ahead. Tax revenues remain
below emerging market and advanced
economies. Pressing ahead with the Tax
System Reform Strategy 2021-2030 would be
important, including reducing exemptions
and rationalizing preferential regimes,
broadening the VAT base, raising
environmental tax and excise duties,
introducing a unified property tax and a land
registry, and revisiting personal income tax
thresholds.

Authorities’ Views
18.
The authorities noted that fiscal policy, as monetary policy is constrained, is
supporting economic growth after a weak 2023. They agreed there is fiscal space to provide
further support if needed, especially through public investment. At the same time, they noted
revenue collection in 2023 was weak due to the real estate downturn and cautioned the revenue
recovery will be gradual amid still weak domestic demand and the uncertain external
environment. The authorities noted that reforms to several tax laws are being discussed in the
National Assembly, and the new land and real estate related laws will help resolve some of the
bottlenecks in implementing public infrastructure. They argued that the rises in wages and
pensions are needed given the low levels and that potential inflation impact from the public
wage increases is expected to be contained. Nevertheless, the government will phase in increases
in administrative prices to reduce potential inflationary pressures. They acknowledged more

Vietnam spends around 0.7 percent of GDP on social assistance, excluding health insurance subsidies (Dutta
and Sen, 2018). Social assistance coverage is below 20 percent of the workforce, and its benefits represent
around 5 percent of the household average monthly consumption for the poorest quintile (World Bank, 2019).
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

13

VIETNAM

efforts are needed to improve fiscal statistics, in line with international standards, and will
continue to address them with the Fund support.

C. Financial Sector
19.
The resilience of the financial system has been shaken in recent years due to several
shocks and risks remain elevated. Banks are vulnerable to highly leveraged firms that are still
reeling from Covid, the sharp fall in exports in 2022, and the turbulence in real estate. SBV took
several measures to contain the damage from the shocks, including taking control of SCB in
October 2022. The authorities also took several ad-hoc measures to support corporates under
financial distress including extending forbearance for NPL restructuring and allowing (unlisted)
bond buybacks by underwriting banks (2023 Article IV). These actions have provided some
respite, but more reforms are needed to address the still high vulnerabilities. In particular:
•

Addressing bottlenecks in the real estate sector that are constraining new projects and
limiting supply. The recent changes to the
land, housing, and real estate business
laws should reduce legal uncertainty
(including inconsistences between laws)
and improve transparency in real estate
transactions (e.g., land valuation will be
based on market prices and updated
more regularly). Effective and swift
implementation of the new laws, the
planned development of a national land
registration database, and further reforms
on governance will be critical to support
the rebound of the real estate sector.

•

Enhancing the effectiveness of the debt enforcement and insolvency framework remains
crucial to deal with highly leveraged corporates and help banks address NPLs. The reform will
need to include the strengthening of: collateral enforcement for all actors, mechanisms for
out-of-court settlement and hybrid restructuring, corporate reorganization proceedings, the
effectiveness of the liquidation framework, and institutions handling insolvency cases.

20.
Strengthening the financial system will require efforts to bolster banks’ balance
sheets and ensure greater credit quality, which would also help promote higher and
sustainable economic growth. Amid a credit surge in late 2023 and rising NPLs, provisioning
levels fell, but still average above 50 percent, and liquidity tightened. 5 Efforts to strengthen
financial sector resilience and better manage risks require a more proactive approach, especially
by supervisors. Increasing bank capital ratios remains a challenge especially given fast credit

14

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

VIETNAM

growth. SBV has incentivized capital increases through dividend distribution in the form of
shares, allowing state-owned commercial banks to retain profits and supporting the issuance of
Tier-2 capital instruments. Banks will need to improve asset quality through timely loss
recognition, faster write-offs, improvement of NPL workouts and capitalization, while phasingout forbearance. Such efforts, combined with a strong macroprudential toolkit, would help
promote greater quality and sustainable credit growth.
21.
The new Law on Credit Institutions (LCI) aims to improve bank supervision and
crisis preparedness frameworks, but further reforms are needed. Following the failure of
SCB, the LCI was revised on several fronts: it tightens restrictions and increases transparency on
bank ownership and related party lending; introduces a new recovery planning framework and
provisions dealing with bank runs; adjusts the triggers for early intervention; and strengthens the
role of SBV as the resolution authority. However, the reform fell short in some areas by not
introducing: legal protection of SBV staff that act in good faith; a framework for consolidated
supervision; and remedies to gaps in the resolution regime. In addition, supervisory practices and
capacity need to be updated incorporating the lessons learnt from recent bank failures. SBV and
other agencies are working towards addressing the recommendations from the 2023 IMF
Financial Sector Stability Review, including on the stress testing framework, the introduction of
risk-based SBV internal audit, and strengthening of securities supervision and regulation. There
has been limited progress in addressing AML/CFT weaknesses (Box 3).
22.
A prompter resolution of banks under special control would help contain costs and
avoid constraining SBV’s ability to achieve its mandates. The planned transfer by SBV of the
four banks that failed in 2015 to acquiring banks by the end of this year is welcome. The
resolution of SCB will present a greater challenge given the uncertainty on the quality and
valuation of its loan book. SBV, up to the first
quarter of 2024, provided significant liquidity to
SCB, estimated at 5.6 percent of GDP, while
having to control the overall degree of liquidity
in the banking system. The plan to gradually
wind down SCB will likely take time, be costly,
and could hamper SBV’s ability to address future
shocks. Further reforms to the bank resolution
framework, including allowing to sell parts of
failed banks, would facilitate timely restructuring.
Authorities’ Views
23.
The authorities agreed that continued vigilance is required as the banking sector is
recovering after large shocks in recent years. Although bank performance has been improving
and banks are making efforts to improve their capitalization, the environment remains
challenging. As the economy is forecasted to face many difficulties and challenges in 2024,
businesses and households continue to encounter difficulty on repaying bank loans, SBV has

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

15

VIETNAM

issued a Circular allowing the extension of loan forbearance with the aim to reduce loan
repayment pressure and create conditions for businesses and households to access capital to
help the economic recovery. SBV has instructed banks to manage credit risk carefully. SBV is
preparing for the implementation of the 2024 LCI and efforts are being made to incorporate
lessons learnt from recent bank failures in bank supervisory practice. The authorities agreed with
the need to resolve the banks under special control expeditiously but noted that in some cases it
will take time, including due to ongoing legal procedures.
Box 3. Improving Vietnam’s Anti-Money Laundering and Combating the Financing of
Terrorism (AML/CFT) Framework
Vietnam is exposed to a range of money laundering risks and less pronounced terrorist financing
risks. The main sources of illegal proceeds include corruption, organized crimes, fraud, drug trafficking,
tax evasion, and human trafficking. The banking sector is particularly vulnerable to these threats due to its
dominance in the economy.1
Vietnam’s AML/CFT framework needs significant improvements. The framework was evaluated in
2019 by the Asia Pacific Group on Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing (APG). As a result of the
strategic deficiencies identified, Vietnam was placed under the Financial Action Task Force (FATF)’s
enhanced monitoring (“grey list”) in 2023. The government has made a high-level political commitment to
work with the FATF and APG to strengthen its AML/CFT regime by implementing an action plan agreed
with the two bodies.
Prolonged delays in addressing a deficient and ineffective AML/CFT framework may undermine
financial integrity and negatively impact the country’s financial sector and the economy. Some of
the other countries subject to the FATF’s enhanced monitoring experienced not only losses of
correspondent banking relationships but also reduction of FDI and other capital inflows. Weak AML/CFT
measures also prevent a country from leveraging the AML/CFT tools to help tackle crimes such as
corruption and tax evasion.
Efforts to implement the action plan need to be prioritized, starting with aligning the legal
framework with the FATF standards. A new AML/CFT law was enacted in 2023, which does not address
the shortcomings sufficiently. Amending this law in line with the FATF standards would improve the
framework, including with respect to AML/CFT measures implemented by the private sector, AML/CFT
supervision, identifying ultimate beneficial owners, investigation and conviction of money launderers, and
international cooperation on AML/CFT. Despite efforts made in areas such as strengthening domestic
coordination and cooperation, and the improvement the financial intelligence unit, APG recently found
none of the recommendations have been fully addressed. Swift steps towards the legal reforms are
needed, demonstrating the political will to improve the framework in cooperation with the FATF and APG.

D. Structural and Climate Policies
24.
Sustaining high economic growth will require significant efforts to improve
productivity amidst demographic and climate-related headwinds. Vietnam’s stellar
performance over the last decades was the result of sound policies but there are important
headwinds ahead. Vietnam benefited from
having a young population, but these trends are
projected to reverse as the population ages and
the share of workers in the total population
shrinks. The growth potential is also at risk as
Vietnam is highly vulnerable to climate change
(2023 Article IV Staff Report). Based on growth
patterns of similar countries, Vietnam’s mediumterm growth could decline to 4.5-5.5 percent
over the decade (Annex V). To counter this trend,
it will be essential to significantly increase
productivity. Despite augmenting its human capital stock, productivity has not followed suit and
Vietnam still lags regional peers. This is mainly due to the pervasive labor skill mismatches and,
more broadly, resource misallocation (2020 Article IV Staff Report).
25.
Making the most of FDI, while adopting reforms to enhance productivity and
competitiveness in the domestic sector, is key to ensure sustained growth. Vietnam’s
export-led growth strategy relies heavily on FDI. However, FDI firms are not well integrated into
the domestic economy, resulting in a dual
economy with few high productivity (mostly
FDI) firms. This disconnect prevents
technological diffusion and productivity
spillovers to local firms and acts as a drag on
aggregate productivity. Broader structural
reforms are needed to improve the business
environment, including the functioning of the
labor market, reducing red tape and legal
uncertainty, and continuing to invest in human
and physical capital.
26.
Strengthening the functioning and governance of capital markets could help boost
productivity and economic growth over the medium term. Well-functioning equity and bond
markets could help better allocate capital and develop a more productive domestic private
sector. It will require pressing ahead with reforming the insolvency framework as well as:
•

Developing a mature sovereign bond market (SIP chapter). While the government has
enjoyed relatively low interest rates due to captive demand from Vietnam Social Security
(VSS), it risks the long-term sustainability of the pension system (or constraining social
benefits), weakens monetary policy transmission, and creates distortions that raise the cost of
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

17

VIETNAM

capital for firms. Reforming the government bond market would help diversify the investor
base, increase liquidity, and establish a reliable yield curve that could serve as a benchmark
for deepening capital markets. It would also help improve ratings for Vietnam’s public debt.
The development of the bond market would require a gradual broadening of VSS’s
investment mandate, allowing a more market-based determination of yields across different
maturities, and better functioning foreign exchange and interest rate hedging markets.
•

Enhancing transparency, regulation, capacity of the regulators, and consumer protection. This
will be critical to recover retail investors’ trust in the corporate bond market and promote
public offerings.

Sources: Vietnamese authorities, Haver, IFS, and IMF staff calculations.

27.
Achieving Vietnam’s climate goals will require accelerating the implementation of
the government’s green agenda. Progress on plans to adopt a pilot for a carbon market for key
sectors (thermal power, steel and cement) in 2025, and to have the carbon market fully
operational in 2028, has been slow. It will require developing a green taxonomy to define carbon
credits and compliance mechanisms. It will also be useful to ensure the overall tax system
discourages fossil fuels, as well as build infrastructure to scale up renewable energy production
and alleviate transmission bottlenecks. Tackling climate adaptation will also require enhancing
comprehensive risk assessments and prioritizing investments in resilient infrastructure. With most
of the investment envisaged to be funded by international partners and private sector, including
through the Just Energy Transition Partnership and green bond issuances, improving the
business environment and strengthening financial market regulations will be key.
28.
Vietnam is undergoing an anti-corruption campaign, whose benefits could be
strengthened and sustained by improving economic governance. Public servants, senior
government officials, and business leaders have been caught in the anti-corruption drive. The
efforts to reduce corruption can yield important benefits. However, there are concerns of
increased near-term uncertainty, with delays in investment decisions potentially affecting the
investment climate in the short term (as typically seen in other countries). Putting a greater focus
on improving preventive anti-corruption institutions and economic governance could help

18

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

VIETNAM

address the concerns and ensure gains are realized and sustained. 6 Creating a high-level interagency group to oversee and facilitate the implementation of the key reforms, that could be led
by the Prime-Minister’s office, could help speed up key reforms, including on: (i) making laws and
regulations clearer (as is being done for the real estate and land related laws), and strengthening
the judiciary, anti-corruption institutions and regulatory bodies; (ii) improving transparency,
including on the reporting of economic statistics; and (iii) addressing the weaknesses in the
AML/CFT framework.
Greater quality and timely reporting of economic statistics could help improve
policies, manage risks, and allow households and firms to make better decisions. While
there have been improvements, there are still significant data gaps including on external and
monetary sectors, as well as on public finances (Annex VIII). Putting greater efforts to address the
gaps would have important benefits. For example, more sharing of information across
government agencies would help better design policies and manage risks. Improved
dissemination of information to the public would help firms, investors, and households make
better decisions. It would also help address some shortcomings with the data provided to the
Fund that hamper surveillance (Annex X). Progress will require accelerating ongoing efforts to
build capacity and high-level efforts to overcome regulatory barriers to the sharing of
information across government agencies and with the public. It will be key to make further
improvements on:

29.

•

Public finances. For example, efforts by the Ministry of Finance to shorten the publication lag
of final fiscal account and adopt more comprehensive finance statistics closer to international
standards could be accelerated.

•

External statistics. SBV has initiated efforts to improve external statistics together with
support by the Fund, including producing an estimate for international investment position,
addressing the large errors and omissions in the balance of payments, and preparing a new
FDI survey.

•

Pressing ahead with efforts to improve monetary statistics and tackle weaknesses on national
accounts (e.g., fully include e-commerce and the informal economy) would allow for a better
assessment of the financial sector and the real economy. Other areas include developing real
estate price indices and the inclusion of crypto assets transactions.

Authorities’ Views
30.
The authorities concurred further efforts are needed to sustain high medium-term
growth and implement the climate agenda. Aging and climate posed important challenges to
maintain high growth and will require efforts to boost productivity. They noted that achieving
the nation’s ambitious development and climate goals will take time, but reforms are ongoing.
The authorities also stressed the importance of international support to help developing nations
6

For example, the authorities are in the process of setting a national database on asset and income by 2025:Q4.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

19

VIETNAM

like Vietnam to finance the green agenda. The authorities noted they are taking measures to
strengthen capital markets, including the corporate bond market. The Ministry of Finance has
been proactive to develop the government bond market in line with international practices, while
recognizing more efforts are needed especially to increase liquidity and diversify the investors’
base in the secondary market.
31.
The authorities agreed with the importance of improving governance and
preventing measures to combat corruption, as well as improve the quality and
dissemination of economic data. SBV is committed to significantly upgrade the production and
dissemination of external and monetary statistics in line with international standards. The MOF is
working towards improving its system to better use data available in the Treasury. They
welcomed the ongoing Fund support on capacity building for improving macro-economic
statistics but cautioned that it would take time and resources. They also agreed to the
importance of stepping up inter-agency collaboration to produce and disseminate better and
more timely data. They concurred with the importance of taking preventive measures in
combating corruption and strengthening governance, while noting that any identified corrupt
practices would face consequences. The authorities indicated that they are making progress in
implementing the APG recommendations on AML/CFT reform and acknowledged the need to
speed up reforms.

STAFF APPRAISAL
32.
After large shocks, Vietnam’s economic recovery is gaining impetus thanks to
expansionary policies and a rebound in external demand. However, a challenging global
environment, vulnerable corporate balance sheets, and medium-term challenges (aging, climate)
pose headwinds. Sustaining the impressive pre-Covid growth track record will require efforts to
improve the monetary and fiscal policy frameworks and reforms to promote a more resilient
financial sector and boost productivity growth. Governance reforms that complement the anticorruption drive would help reduce short-term uncertainties and cement long-term gains.
33.
Monetary policy will need to navigate supporting the recovery, while remaining
vigilant against inflation risks. The current accommodative monetary stance has appropriately
supported the recovery in the aftermath of large adverse shocks. As the recovery accelerates, the
authorities should stand ready to tighten monetary policy if inflation pressures intensify and
avoid policies to incentivize excessive credit growth. Accelerating steps to modernize the
monetary policy framework should be a priority, including allowing greater exchange rate
flexibility while safeguarding FX reserve buffers to help manage large shocks. Other key steps
include greater operational autonomy to SBV and replacing credit growth ceilings and
forbearance measures with a sound macroprudential framework.
34.
Fiscal policy, together with monetary policy, has been sustaining the gradual
recovery in domestic activity and facilitating private sector deleveraging. Fiscal policy also

20

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

VIETNAM

needs to remain nimble given the uncertain outlook. If inflation pressures were to significantly
intensify, a tighter fiscal stance would help SBV anchor inflation expectations. The government
should also devise a medium-term strategy for gradual wage and pension increases, to attract a
professional and qualified civil service, while avoiding large annual increases that can fuel price
pressures. Upgrading the medium-term fiscal framework, including strengthening budget
processes, increasing fiscal transparency, improving social safety nets, and enhancing revenue
mobilization would help address challenges ahead and improve the effectiveness of public
policies.
35.
The external sector position in 2023 is assessed to be substantially stronger than
warranted by fundamentals and desirable policies. Caution is needed as the assessment is
constrained by the effects of large temporary shocks and data gaps in the BOP (errors and
omissions of 4 percent of GDP in 2023; Annex IV). The current account surplus reflected, to a
large degree, the large import contraction in 2023, even as exports fell, and is expected to
unwind over the next years. Nevertheless, external imbalances should be addressed through
structural policies geared at mitigating precautionary savings, e.g., by improving social safety
nets, and enhancing non-FDI related investment. FX reserves are assessed to be moderately
below adequacy at end-2023 against the backdrop of efforts by SBV to gradually rebuild its
buffers after a large external adverse shock.
36.
Continuing to build the resilience of the financial sector remains a priority,
including bolstering banks and corporates’ balance sheets. Bank asset quality and capital
ratios need to be improved, while phasing out loan forbearance. The revision of the law on credit
institutions is a significant step forward, but implementation will be critical. It should be followed
by reforms to strengthen bank supervision policies and practices, including ensuring appropriate
legal protection to SBV staff, introducing a framework for risk-based and consolidated
supervision, and monitoring connected counterparties.
37.
Strengthening the ability to resolve failed banks and reform the insolvency
framework would improve the functioning of the financial system and capital markets. The
planned compulsory transfer of four banks by the end of this year is welcome. An expedited
resolution of SCB would help contain resolution costs and avoid hampering SBV’s ability to
conduct monetary policy. Further reforms to the bank resolution framework would facilitate the
timely restructuring of failed banks. The introduction of an effective debt enforcement and
insolvency framework remains a key priority to deal with overleveraged corporates.
38.
Wide-ranging structural and climate reforms are critical to ensure high growth over
the medium term. Less favorable demographic trends will reduce the growth rate and climate
change will bring new challenges. To offset these, it will be essential to increase productivity,
including by adopting structural reforms to improve the business environment and invest in
human and physical capital. Supporting the development and climate agendas will require a
regulatory framework to attract private investment to scale up renewable energy. Improving the
functioning and governance of capital markets would also help boost productivity. It will require

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

21

VIETNAM

upgrading the government bond market, based on market prices, which would help reduce
distortions and strengthen monetary policy transmission.
39.
Improving economic governance along with strengthening anti-corruption
frameworks will pave the road to achieving Vietnam’s developmental goals. Having clearer
laws and rules, reducing red tape, and promoting greater transparency would help reduce legal
uncertainty and allow a swifter decision-making process by public officials. The government
could consider creating a high-level inter-agency group to oversee and facilitate the
implementation of key reforms, including urgently addressing the weaknesses in the AML/CFT
framework given that Vietnam is behind schedule in implementing the agreed action plan.
40.
Moving ahead with efforts to improve the production and dissemination of
economic statistics would help develop better policies and increase transparency. It requires
removing institutional barriers to the dissemination of economic data and a medium-term
strategy to improve the quality of statistics. These efforts will require greater cooperation by all
key public agencies. Enhanced transparency will help deepen financial markets and help
government agencies, businesses, and households take more informed decisions.
41.
It is recommended that the next Article IV consultation be held on the standard 12month cycle.

Annex I. Progress Against IMF Recommendations
Policies

2023 Article IV Consultation
Recommendations
Further fiscal support could be
considered, especially if the
economic recovery disappoints.

Fiscal
Policy

Policies could focus on spending to
address infrastructure and
social needs.

Monetary
Policy

Fiscal policy has become more expansionary to
support the recovery. The authorities continued
tax and land rent deferrals, and tax/fee reductions
2023H2. In 2024, tax reductions have been
continued, including a VAT cut (by 2 percent until
end-2024) and an environmental tax reduction
(by 50 percent).

Reducing exemptions and
rationalizing preferential regimes
for FDI firms, broadening the VAT
base, and raising environmental tax
and excise duties.

MOF has proposed to amend the laws on VAT,
CIT and excise tax. The proposals have been
disclosed for public consultation and would be
included in the National Assembly’s legislative
agenda in 2024. Possible amendments include
broadening the VAT tax base, narrowing
exemptions from VAT, lowering CIT rates for
SMEs, revising some articles of the CIT law in the
context of GMT adoption, and raising excise tax
on alcohol and beer.

Revenue mobilization efforts over
the medium term are needed to
reverse the trend of tax erosion and
create space to bolster social
spending and address infrastructure
gaps.

Vietnam passed a resolution on adoption of topup CIT of 15 per cent under the Global Anti-Base
Erosion (GloBE) model rules, effective on January
1, 2024.

Monetary policy should be cautious
and data dependent given
significant underlying risks.
Greater exchange rate flexibility to
absorb external shocks.

Accelerating modernization of the
monetary framework.

Actions Since 2023 Article IV Consultation

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

More efforts have been put in place to strengthen
tax administration through digital transformation.
Tax authorities have enhanced risk-based tax
management processes. E-commerce and digitalbased tax administration have also improved.
Monetary policy was accommodative in most
2023 to support economic growth.
FXI since mid-2023 has been limited until Q2
2024, when the SBV resumed its spot
interventions following FX pressures, while also
allowing depreciation.
The modernization of the monetary policy
framework is ongoing, with the SBV enhancing its
analytical and forecasting capacity through IMFsupported Forecasting and Policy Analysis System

restructured after January 1, 2023, but new loan
forbearance was introduced in April 2023.

Enhance banking sector resilience.

Adoption of Basel II is continuing. The new Law
on Credit Institutions was ratified in early 2024
and came into effect on July 1, 2024. This new law
is expected to help enhance system stability
through increasing ownership transparency,
diversifying shareholder bases and empowering

SBV as the resolution authority.

A new AML-CFT law was passed and came into
effect in March 2023, but it addresses the
shortcomings identified only to a limited extent.
The SBV also issued the AML Circular to provide
specific AML requirements for the banking sector.

Strengthen domestic capital market.

Credit rating requirement and limits on retail
investors came into effect on January 1, 2024. The
rule that banks are not allowed to buy back
unlisted corporate bonds was resumed on
January 1, 2024. All corporate bonds must now be
listed on a trading platform which was introduced
in the last quarter of 2023.

Improving fintech regulation.

Vietnam has made progress toward digital
transformation in both public service and
business, especially in the banking and finance
sectors. More public services can be provided
through the e-government Portal, including tax
and customs services.

Making laws and administrative
processes clearer, simpler and more
transparent to provide greater legal
certainty and reduce corruption.

Several important economic laws, including the
revised land law, real estate business law, housing
law, and law on credit institutions were ratified
late last year. These laws will come into effect
either mid-this year or early next year to help
address difficulties in the real estate sector and
improve banking sector resilience.

Labor market reform and efforts to

Addressing data gaps to help
enhance transparency and better
inform policy making and risk
management.

MOF has been working on a plan to reduce the
lag of final account reporting from 18 months to
12 months. The conversion of state budget data
aligned with GFSM 2014 has been slowly
continued and Vietnam has published GFS data
for 2003-22 on the IMF website. The authorities
are working on improving BOP data, especially
reducing E&Os. The SBV is working on IIP
statistics. IMF TA supports the efforts on BoP and
IIP data.

Reforms to accelerate climate
change mitigation.

Vietnam has committed to reaching net-zero
emissions by 2050. The authorities are developing
a carbon market framework. 10.3 million forest
carbon credits (10.3 million tones of CO2) were
sold for the first time through the World Bank.

Annex II. Integration of Capacity Development Assistance in
Surveillance
Overview
1.
To achieve its ambitious development objectives, Vietnam needs to continue to
modernize its economic institutions and policy frameworks. The IMF and other development
partners are actively engaged in their respective areas of expertise and are coordinating regularly.
2.
CD has been well integrated with IMF surveillance. High-quality CD remains central in
strengthening the effective implementation of IMF policy advice and engagement with the
authorities. The main surveillance priorities include modernizing policy frameworks, enhancing
financial stability, and improving data quality and transparency to help Vietnam transit to the next
phase of its development.
3.
Fund CD assistance focuses on Vietnam’s ambitious reform agenda. IMF CD assistance is
playing a key role in SBV’s plan to modernize its monetary policy framework via the FPAS and
enhancements in central bank operations. An internal audit TA to the SBV aims at improving central
bank governance. A FSSR was undertaken, and a broad reform roadmap has been designed to help
enhance financial stability. The IMF stands ready to continue helping the SBV to strengthen financial
stability and enhance its monetary policy operations and tools. On fiscal, the IMF continues to
support the authorities’ efforts to strengthen treasury management, domestic revenue mobilization,
tax administration, and public debt management. The IMF has also provided TA to strengthen
capacity in macroeconomic analysis and forecasting in the Ministry of Planning and Investment. IMF
TA will also continue to support the authorities’ initiatives to improve the coverage, quality, and
timeliness of fiscal and external sector statistics. Vietnam has also benefitted from IMF TA and
capacity building on AML/CFT, central bank digital currency, pension fund reform, customs
modernization, and climate policies.

Annex IV. External Sector Assessment
Vietnam’s external position in 2023 was assessed to be substantially stronger than the level implied by
medium-term fundamentals and desirable policies. The current account registered a large surplus of
5.8 percent of GDP in 2023. The widening of the current account gap reflects, to a large degree, the
sizable contraction in merchandise imports as the economy was hit by large adverse external and
domestic shocks. Other contributing factors included improved services trade due to the pick-up in
tourism and a rebound in remittance inflows. Policies targeted at stimulating internal demand would
aid, along with structural reforms, with the external adjustment and bring the current account back to
its norm.
1.
The current account surplus increased in 2023 to 5.8 percent of GDP from 0.3 percent
in 2022, following a contraction in merchandise imports in 2023H1 and a rebound in services
exports. Emerging from the financial sector distress of 2022Q4 amidst weak external demand,
Vietnam’s merchandise exports and to a larger
degree imports contracted sharply in the first half
of 2023. Weak domestic demand contributed to
the drop in imports by 9.2 percent in 2023.
Imports, notably those for re-exports, recovered
only in 2023Q4 as external demand picked up. At
the same time, tourist arrivals rose to 90 percent of
pre-pandemic levels bolstering services exports.
The import contraction and narrowing of the
services deficit, combined with a surge in net
transfers by 130 percent due to higher remittance
inflows bolstered the current account surplus.

4.
Vietnam’s external position in 2023 is
assessed to be substantially stronger than
warranted by fundamentals and desirable
policies; but caution is needed given large
shocks and data shortcomings. Based on the
current account model, the CA gap is estimated at
8.1 percent of GDP. The gap captures policy gaps
from relatively tight fiscal policy (less expansionary
compared to the rest of the world). At the same
time, a sizeable unexplained factor remains (even
larger than the policy gap), which suggests that, to
a large degree, the gap increase reflects the
weakened conditions that resulted from the
financial shock and capital outflows. Further, the
CA gap also partly reflects data gaps in the BOP
(large errors and omissions of 4 percent of GDP in
2023) and structural factors not accounted for by
the model (like informality and weak social safety
nets that lead to precautionary saving).

FX reserves increased by 6 percent (USD 5.6 billion) in 2023. Relative to the large
drawdown of reserves (about 20 percent) in 2022, FX intervention in 2023 was limited. Gradual
accumulation of reserves brought the GIR balance to USD 92.3 billion by 2023 year-end (2.8 times
the level of short-term external debt and 3 months of prospective imports). This level corresponds

Annex V. Medium-Term Growth Prospects for Vietnam 1
Vietnam has experienced high growth rates over the last two decades thanks to its sound policies,
stable macro and sociopolitical environments, and demographic tailwinds. However, it is not certain
such growth rates can be sustained in the future. We study the historical growth dynamics comparing
with other Asian countries, using different empirical approaches and analyze likely medium-term
growth paths based on experience of similar countries. The analysis shows that growth drivers have
been changing over time. In particular, the demographic dividend is nearing its end and demographic
factors will become headwinds. New emerging growth drivers include increasing trade openness and
FDI and human capital accumulation. Finally, medium-term growth is expected to decline if it follows
the patterns of similar experiences of other countries, highlighting the need for further reforms to
sustain the ambitious development agenda.
1.
Vietnam has experienced high growth rates over the last two decades. Real GDP and
real GDP per capital growth averaged 6.7 and 5.6 percent during 2000-19, significantly higher than
the averages of EMs globally (4 and 2.8 percent).
This was a period of market-oriented reforms
geared towards an export-oriented strategy and
integration into the global economy (joined the
WTO in 2007), while maintaining a stable
sociopolitical environment, and (then) still young
population.
2.
Going forward, the question is whether
such high growth rates could be sustained. The
past decade has seen growth in global and Asian
EMs trending down, amid demographics headwinds. Moreover, historical lessons from other Asian
EMs suggest it is difficult to maintain high growth when income reaches a certain level. Against this
backdrop, the analysis aims to examine Vietnam’s medium-term growth drivers and prospects from
different perspectives, including a growth
accounting exercise and a machine learning
approach to identify historical growth drivers, and
a machine learning-based forecasting model to
inform on the likely growth path based on the
historical trajectories of similar experiences by
other countries. The analysis offers a
comprehensive view of historical and emerging
growth drivers of Vietnam and potential areas of
reforms to sustain high growth going forward.

A.

Growth Accounting Decomposition

3.
A growth accounting exercise is used to analyze the contribution of each production
factor to Vietnam’s growth. A workhorse semi-endogenous growth (SEG) model is used to
decompose Vietnam’s growth. Specifically, aggregate output (Y) depends on physical capital (K),
labor (L), human capital (h) and total factor productivity (A) equals 𝑌𝑌 = 𝐾𝐾 𝛼𝛼 (𝐴𝐴ℎ𝐿𝐿)1−𝛼𝛼 , where 𝛼𝛼 equals
the labor share in total income. After some simple algebraic manipulation, this setup can be simply
extended to include population (P) and labor force (LF):
𝑌𝑌/𝑃𝑃 = (𝐾𝐾/𝑌𝑌)𝛼𝛼/(1−𝛼𝛼) 𝐴𝐴ℎ × 𝐿𝐿/𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿 × 𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿/𝑃𝑃

Note that L/LF represents the employment while LF/P is inversely related to the dependency ratio
(i.e., how many working people are in relation to the young and the elderly). The analysis uses data
spanning from 2000 to 2019, for 26 Asia-Pacific countries from the Penn World Tables (Y, K, L, h, A)
combined with data from the United Nations (P, LF) and the International Labour Organisation (α).
After rewriting the equation above in growth terms, the data are imputed into the framework,
resulting in the overall growth and factor contributions. The results are shown in the text table that
presents the average annual growth rates for Vietnam and for country income groups (advanced
economies, emerging markets, and low-income countries).
4.
Vietnam had a stellar growth performance and fueled partly by remarkable increase in
human capital; however, aggregate productivity did not follow suit due to frictions. Over the
last 2 decades Vietnam’s growth far exceeded the growth of the average emerging market. Most of
this growth is accounted by (physical) capital deepening but it is also notable the solid contribution
from human capital accumulation. In contrast, aggregate productivity acted as a drag on growth.
This somewhat surprising finding masks another relevant factor: resource misallocation. Further staff
analysis using firm-level data from Orbis suggests that misallocation has increased in recent years.
Once this is accounted for, the residual productivity term (within-firm change in productivity) points
to small average annual growth.

Demographic factors have contributed positively to Vietnam’s growth over past
decades but will become increasingly a larger
drag in the future. The last four columns of the
table show the role played by demographic
factors. Looking to the past, both L/LF and
especially LF/P contributed positively to growth.
However, as the population ages, these
contributing factors will instead detract from
growth (as shown in the next to last column),
resulting in a combined change of 0.7 percentage
points per year (last column). This suggests that,
since demographic factors are hard to reverse, 2
Vietnam needs to focus on finding alternative
growth drivers.

B.

Identification of Medium-Term Growth Drivers Using Machine

Learning

6.
A machine learning approach is employed to provide a broader view of the evolving
drivers of medium-term growth. Random forest is a machine learning algorithm that consists of
multiple regression trees which are built by recursively partitioning the sample into subsamples
based on the values of predictors. Such nonparametric model structure lends itself well to prediction
task where the target is affected by many predictors in a complex way, including nonlinearities and
interactions. The sample consists of 37 Asia-Pacific countries over the period of 1970-2019. The
target is the average growth in the next five years. There are in total 75 predictors, which are
grouped into six broader categories, including development level and economic structure,
demographics, human capital, macro stability, sociopolitical stability, and global factors and
openness. To identify drivers and quantify their contributions to medium-term growth, Shapley
values, a concept borrowed from cooperative game theory, are used to quantify the marginal
contribution of each predictor to the medium-term growth in excess of the sample average, for each
observation (i.e., country-year pair).
7.
Vietnam has seen diminishing demographic dividend, with human capital and
economic openness increasingly contributing to medium-term growth. Demographic dividend
was one of the key drivers of medium-term growth since late-1990s and contributed more than half
of its medium-term growth during late-2000s. However, as the population ages, demographic
factors no longer contributed positively to the medium-term growth since early-2010s, and even
became a small drag on medium-term growth. At the same time, human capital and economic
openness have contributed increasingly to growth, thanks to progress in enhancing human capital

and increasing economic openness. Vietnam has a Human Capital Index of 0.67 out of 1 in 2018,
ranked 48 out of 157 countries and higher than the average of upper middle-income countries.
Following its accession to the WTO in 2007, Vietnam’s trade has expanded significantly, with exports
increasing from about 60 percent of GDP in 2007 to 80 percent in 2019.
8.
During 2000s, growth in working-age population, was the top medium-term growth
driver, contributing to more than 0.5 percentage point of growth by itself. However, during
2010s, trade openness emerged as a key driver, along with Vietnam’s accession to the WTO and
integration in the global trade. At the same time, accumulation of human capital and FDI were also
contributing more to growth. In both decades, medium-term exchange rate adjustment and broad
money growth (reflecting financial deepening) have been important growth drivers. The relationship
between medium-term exchange rate (percentage change) and growth is nonlinear (Figure 1). When
the 5-year average depreciation is moderate, i.e., less than 5 percent, more depreciation (or
adjustment) is associated with higher growth in the next five years, potentially due to increased
competitiveness that boosts growth. However, when the 5-year average depreciation is larger (more
than 5 percent), more depreciation is no longer associated with higher growth, potentially because
macroeconomic instability as resulted from disrupted depreciation offset the boost to growth.

Vietnam’s Medium-Term Growth Path: Lessons from its Peers

The dynamic time warping (DTW) algorithm provides a framework for forecasting
Vietnam's medium-term growth path based on the similar experience of other countries. This
machine learning technique compares multidimensional sequences of economic data between
Vietnam and other countries to identify historical periods in other countries that closely mirror
Vietnam's current economic conditions.

The implementation of the methodology starts with identifying historical countryperiods most similar to Vietnam. Similar country-periods are chosen based on the DTW distance

If Vietnam were to follow the growth pattern of its peers, a likely scenario is that
growth would slow to around 4½-5½ percent. The median forecast using the top 0.5 percent
most similar country-periods and the 55th percentile forecast using the top 1 percent most similar
country-periods yield the smallest RMSE, when compared with the realized growth for the most
recent base period of 2015-19. These two versions forecast the growth in 2029 to be in the range of
4.4 to 5.3 percent, and the average growth during 2024-29 to be between 4.6 and 5.2 percent.
However, there is large variation: the range between 45th and 55th percentile of the growth
distribution suggests that growth in five years would be between 4 and 5.3 percent, which widens
further to 3.5-5.6 percent when looking at 40th and 60th percentile. The different growth paths and
relatively large dispersion indicate that there is large degree of heterogeneity even among identified

52

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

similar countries, likely due to remaining differences in their macroeconomic structures and policies
as well as idiosyncratic shocks. Nevertheless, the international experience suggests economic growth
is likely to decline even if Vietnam were to perform above the average of its peers—a likely scenario
suggests growth will converge to somewhere between 4½-5½ percent with Vietnam.

sustain high growth. From looking at

five-year average level, and “change” includes both the one-year

13.
The DTW methodology provides
a spectrum of potential growth
trajectories based on historical analogs,
but some caveats apply. Supported by the underlying theory of economic convergence, the
forecasted growth trajectories are derived from empirically observed growth patterns of similarly
situated economies. Even though future variances are inevitable, the DTW-based forecasts could
offer some historical lessons within a data-informed framework. However, several important caveats
should be noted. Firstly, the methodology relies on long series of high-quality historical data as it
aims to capture the long-term effect of economic convergence. With the data quality possibly
deteriorating as the search for similar episodes, there could be measurement errors that affect both
the search for similar episodes and their subsequent growth. Furthermore, the DTW algorithm
assumes that similar economic circumstances measured by the six variables considered will lead to
similar growth outcomes, which may not always hold true in a rapidly changing global economic
environment. Additionally, the variables used—which are mainly constrained by the availability of a
global sample with long time series—may not capture the full picture of the economy, and the
approach may not fully account for idiosyncratic events and/or shocks that could significantly
impact subsequent growth trajectories, such as major reforms.

D. Conclusions
14.
Vietnam will need to adopt further structural reforms to sustain high growth in the
future. Factors like demographics and those related to economic convergence point to a
deceleration of medium-term growth in Vietnam. Despite these headwinds, there are emerging
growth drivers that have been supporting growth in recent years, including human capital
accumulation and increasing trade openness and FDI inflows—which should continue. Compared to
its peers, there is significant potential to improve productivity in Vietnam, which requires reducing
misallocation by removing frictions that prevent labor and capital from flowing to their most
productive use. Relatedly, increasing the positive spillovers from FDI firms and reducing the dual
economy would serve a way to boost productivity. The analysis also offers historical lessons from
similar peers that have enjoyed high growth, which include maintaining debt sustainability, reducing
informality, and ensuring financing conditions. In addition, Vietnam will need to manage the
legacies from Covid, including a more complex global environment.

Annex VI. Geoeconomic Fragmentation and the Impact on Trade
and FDI 1
Increased geoeconomic fragmentation (GEF) poses risks to all countries, especially those that rely on
an export-oriented growth model like Vietnam. At the same time, Vietnam is seen as benefiting from
trade diversion due to trade tensions between geopolitically distant countries. This annex makes a dive
into the composition of Vietnamese trade and FDI flows and finds evidence of trade reallocation—the
US shifts away from China and imports more from Vietnam—which has potentially led to an
increasing share of Vietnamese domestic value added in exports to the US and attracted more FDI
from both the US and China. These findings offer a nuanced understanding of the implications of GEF
on the Vietnamese economy and cast light on GEF-related risks to its outlook.
1.
Vietnam has been in the spotlight as a potential beneficiary of GEF. Trade tensions
between China and the US since 2017 have sparked the idea of Vietnam benefiting from:
•

Trade rerouting: serving as a one-stop “connector country”, allowing China to reroute its exports
to circumvent trade barriers imposed by the US on strategic sectors of geoeconomic interest,
e.g. electronics and chemicals.

•

Trade reallocation: producing more exports domestically to the US, as the US shifts away from
China, both in strategic sectors and more broadly.

•

FDI inflows either to facilitate trade rerouting and/or trade reallocation.

2.
Assessing these effects requires an in-depth analysis of the composition of trade and
FDI. Some academic studies find evidence that US sourcing was partly reallocated away from China
towards countries like Vietnam and Mexico during 2017-2022 (Alfaro and Chor, 2023; Freund and
others, 2023; Fajgelbaum et al., 2024) and more recently during 2022-2023 following the war in
Ukraine (Gopinath et al., 2024), while others find some evidence of trade rerouting by China through
Vietnam during 2018-2021 (Iyoha et al., 2024). A nuanced assessment is needed to distinguish shifts
in the composition of trade and FDI due to rerouting from those reflecting a reallocation of trade,
either broad-based across all sectors or only in strategic sectors affected by trade barriers, as well as
the benefits for Vietnam. 2

A. Trade Developments
3.
Vietnam increasingly gained market share in US imports during 2018-2022. As widely
documented, trade between the US and China as a share of their total imports has been on decline
since 2017. At the same time, Vietnam’s share of Chinese exports and US imports increased, a trend

The definition of strategic sectors for the trade analysis in this Annex follows IMF WEO (April 2023) based on a list
of strategic sectors from the Atlantic Council and mentions of reshoring-related terms in company earnings calls. The
definition therefore encompasses a wider range of industries than only those targeted by US tariffs, factoring in the
impact of tariffs through input-output linkages. Sectors are defined at the 4-digit HS industry level.

that accelerated during 2018-2022 and has stabilized since. These aggregate trends have been used
to support the claim of trade rerouting of Chinese goods to the US. However, correlations of
aggregate trade flows mask important nuances and require a more in-depth analysis.
4.
Zooming into sectoral trade flows, Vietnam has gained market share in both US and
Chinese demand for goods in strategic sectors. If Vietnam served as a vehicle country for Chinese
exporters to circumvent US tariffs, one would expect similar rising trends in Chinese exports to
Vietnam and US imports from Vietnam specifically in strategic sectors affected by tariffs. But sectoral
trade flows do not reveal clear evidence of a one-way street. US sourcing of strategic inputs from
Vietnam accelerated during 2018-2022 and has stabilized since. The pace of this increase matched
the rise in its overall market share in US imports. But Vietnam’s market share in these strategic
sectors has not yet climbed above its overall market share in US imports despite US tariffs on
China’s strategic sectors. Looking at China, the share of Chinese exports to Vietnam in strategic
sectors has stabilized since 2020. At the same time, China has increasingly imported strategic goods
from Vietnam; its sourcing from Vietnam rose almost threefold from 2 percent in 2017 to 6 percent
in 2023. Combining these trends suggests that strategic exports from China to Vietnam cannot
merely be attributed to rerouting trade to the US. Instead, China may have been increasingly
exporting to Vietnam in strategic sectors as part of Vietnam’s increasing integration into the Chinese
supply chain (e.g., China moves production to Vietnam, possibly due to lower labor costs, and
imports back for further processing or final demand).

58

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

VIETNAM

5.
China-originated value added has been increasingly exported to the US through other
countries. As a share of US imports, value added from China has been roughly equal to imports
from China historically. Since 2016, a gap between the two has become evident, with more value
added from China than imports from China (more
than 1 percent of US total imports), suggesting some
Chinese value added exported to the US through
other countries. While stable during 2017-18, the gap
has widened since 2019, which further accelerated
after the pandemic, reaching about 2.2 percent of US
total imports, almost doubled from 2016. This may
suggest some Chinese exports have been channeled
through other countries to the US to circumvent
trade tariffs, but could also reflect supply chain
reconfiguration—China increases its forward linkages
with other countries (i.e., China supplies intermediate goods for final production abroad)—and/or
moving up the value chain—China increases its value addition in the value chain.
6.
There is no clear evidence of Vietnam’s role as a one-stop trade vehicle in facilitating
Chinese exports to the US. To test whether Vietnam has been used as a one-stop trade vehicle, i.e.,
imports from China are repackaged and exported to the US without additional domestic value
added, one can look at the backward trade linkage with China in Vietnam’s exports to the US, i.e.,
how much China-originated value added is embedded in Vietnam’s exports to the US. If there was a
faster-growing share of China-originated value added in Vietnam’s exports to the US compared to
its peers, it would indicate some evidence of a trade vehicle role. Vietnam’s backward trade
integration with China preceded 2018. The share of China-originated value added in Vietnam’s total
exports to the US has increased at a faster pace than its ASEAN and OECD emerging market peers
since 2000. 3 However, this backward linkage
decelerated during 2018-2022, growing slower than
its peers, suggesting no clear evidence of Vietnam
serving as a trade vehicle. Vietnam has also taken
measures to avoid being used to reroute Chinese
goods to the US to circumvent trade barriers. Notably,
ASEAN emerging markets except Vietnam saw their
backward linkage with China growing faster since
2021. At the sectoral level, there is limited evidence of
trade rerouting through Vietnam in certain strategic
sectors, albeit not broad-based. For example, Vietnam
saw an accelerated growth of backward linkages with China in petroleum, chemical, and nonmetallic mineral products since 2021 while, instead, a slower growth than ASEAN peers in electrical
and machinery products.

Vietnam appears to benefit from trade reallocation—although the rising value added
associated with exports to the US also reflects a pre-2017 trend. The share of domestic value
added in Vietnam’s total exports to the US, has
grown at a fast pace in the aftermath of the Global
Financial Crisis—and not just after 2017—in
contrast to its ASEAN peers (relatively flat) and
OECD peers (declining). Looking at strategic
sectors, the jump in the share of domestic value
added in 2018 was more pronounced, including for
petroleum, chemical and non-metallic mineral, and
electrical and machinery products. Moreover, unlike
the aggregate, these products exhibit a parallel
trend with peers in the years leading to 2017, which
reinforced the potential consequential effect of the
US-China trade tensions on increasing Vietnamese domestic value added. This evidence could
suggest that Vietnam has benefitted from trade reallocation—the US shifted its sourcing from China
to Vietnam—which has led to increasing share of domestic value added, especially in strategic
sectors. Despite the likely positive impact on real economic activity, this finding raises the question
of whether the rise in the domestic value added originates from FDI sectors—for example, Gopinath
et al. (2024) find that Vietnam has seen large increases in both its share of Chinese outward FDI and
its share of US imports—or from domestic sectors.

B. FDI Dynamics
8.
FDI inflows, likely linked to both US and Chinese capital, have risen, reflecting general
trends in the region. Although FDI from the US has
been historically low, part of US-originated FDI may
be channeled through Singapore. Conversely, FDI
inflows from US-aligned countries (Japan and South
Korea) have given way to relatively larger FDI
commitments from Mainland China and regions that
could front for Chinese capital (Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region, Taiwan Province of China). At
the same time, granular data shows a flat trend in
the value of new greenfield FDI going into strategic
sectors during 2017-2022 and an uptick only very
recently. Notably, trends observed in Vietnam largely mimic its regional peers, both in strategic
sectors as in the aggregate allocation of World FDI, weakening the case for Vietnam as a connector
country.

C. Conclusions
9.
Combining insights from granular bilateral trade and FDI flows as well as input-output
linkages, the analysis finds:
•

Aggregate and sectoral trade flows: China’s export share to Vietnam and the US import share
from Vietnam have increased in lockstep, and so has China’s import share from Vietnam. These
trends span also strategic sectors, but only accelerated during 2018-2022, and have ebbed since.

•

Content of Vietnamese exports: Domestic value added in Vietnam’s exports to the US has
increased—especially in strategic sectors—while China-originated value added has remained flat
in all but some strategic sectors since 2017.

•

Aggregate and granular FDI flows: Chinese capital (from mainland and potentially from third
party countries) and possibly US capital (via third party countries) have gained share in
Vietnam’s inward FDI, but FDI inflows have not systematically increased in strategic sectors since
2017, and trends have merely followed FDI inflows to peer countries. 4

10.
Taken together, the evidence suggests that Vietnam appears to benefit from a
reallocation of trade as geopolitically distant countries reconfigure their supply chains rather
than from trade rerouting to circumvent tariffs, especially in certain strategic sectors. Trade
reallocation has likely led to the increasing share of domestic value added in Vietnam’s exports to
the US and attracted both US- and Chinese-originated FDI. More granular data is needed to
understand how ownership structures linked to FDI inflows affect changes in the trade behavior of
firms located in Vietnam. 5 Notwithstanding, the findings inform the implications of GEF on the
Vietnamese economy as well as GEF-related risks to its outlook.
11.
The benefits of rising trade and FDI flows to the domestic sector remain elusive.
Benefits of GEF-related inflows may come from boosting trade activity in the FDI sector and from
translating into value added to the domestic sector, including through higher employment and
wages, technological spillovers, and deepening of domestic firms’ GVC integration. For example,
research on the US-China trade tensions in 2018-2019 finds positive labor market effects in districts
more exposed to trade diversion (Mayr-Dorn and others, 2023). At the same time, Vietnam’s “dual
economy”, or disconnect between activity in the domestic and FDI sectors, weighs negatively on
technological diffusion and productivity spillovers that could boost domestic firm potential (see
2021 Article IV Annex V).
12.
Fragmentation risks clouding Vietnam’s prospects. In relative terms, non-aligned
countries like Vietnam that maintain open trade relationships to all countries may stand to suffer the
least from GEF (IMF, 2023; Bolhuis et al., 2023; Cerdeiro et al., 2021; Goes and Bekkers, 2022). But
4
FDI from China and other countries in the region may include capital of subsidiaries of the US and/or European
companies that reside in Asia, which needs granular ownership data to disentangle.
5
Granular data would allow testing, for example, if Chinese-originated FDI has primarily targeted strategic sectors to
circumvent tariffs or if the influx of FDI has also contributed to the value-added in Vietnam’s exports to China.

62

Vietnam’s position within global supply chains renders it vulnerable to adverse shocks such as:
disruptive movements from commodities fragmentation, raising import prices and affecting export
demand for commodities; unexpected shifts in prohibitive trade policies; increased business
uncertainty when non-alignment bodes policy uncertainty; a sudden reversal of FDI inflows; overall
reduction in external demand from a shrinking global economy.

Annex VII. Revised Law on Credit Institutions Reforms
On July 1, 2024 the revised Law on Credit Institutions (LCI) entered into force in Vietnam. The revision
was undertaken following the financial sector distress in late 2022 and aims to improve regulation in
the areas of bank supervision, early intervention and crisis preparedness. The 2023 Financial Sector
Stability Review (FSSR) conducted by the Fund recommended reforms in the legal framework
pertaining to these areas. The table below sets out the relevant FSSR recommendation and identifies
relevant reforms in the LCI without providing an assessment of the adequacy of these reforms. In
addition to these reforms, authorities also made changes in areas such as the definition of related
party lending and NPLs and regulations on tightened cross-ownership between banks and large
exposure limits.
IMF FSSR Recommendation
Enhance legal protection of banking regulators 1
Provide guidance on classifying group exposures
(connected counterparties)
Introduce legal framework for consolidated
supervision that includes: data collection and
access, issuance of prudential standards by SBV,
enforcement powers and requirement that banks
manage risk on a consolidated basis
Require that banks adopt and publish their own
definitions of related parties that encompass all
requirements of the LCI and develop risk
management processes to identify individual
exposures to related parties
Improve governance for non-bank credit
institutions including qualification requirements
for directors and introduction of fit and proper
requirements
The SBV should be clearly designated as the
resolution authority and operational
independence should be ensured

The recommendation also includes legal reform on SBV accountability for discharge of its mandate, establishing procedures to
ensure operational independence and improving SBV’s budget and staff compensation which are covered by the Central Bank Act
and not considered here.

IMF FSSR Recommendation

Triggers for special early intervention and special
control should be redefined to allow SBV to take
immediate action if a bank is no longer viable

Reforms in Law on Credit Institutions 2024

• New early intervention regime created with

some capital and liquidity triggers that allows
for faster SBV intervention (Art. 156-161).

• Special control triggers changed and

expressly linked to deterioration of the
situation of the bank during early

intervention. In addition, a bank run has been

added as a trigger. The capital trigger has not
been changed (Art. 162).
Authorities should adopt a special bank
resolution regime consistent with international
standards
The requirement for recovery planning should be
included in the LCI

Not covered by the reform.

• New recovery planning regime introduced
which requires the drafting of a ‘remedial

plan’ that can be activated in case of early
intervention (Art. 143). Content includes

financial and operational analysis of bank,
potential failure scenarios, triggers, and
remedial actions.

Resolution 42 – establish the main component of
the Resolution into law and extend the scope to
non-bank financial institutions (NBFIs)

• Change in the definition of credit institution
to clarify that the LCI includes NBFIs (Art. 4).
As Resolution 42 has been incorporated in
the LCI (Art. 195-205), the application of
Resolution 42 now extends to NBFIs.

Creation of regulatory sandbox

• A controlled pilot mechanism has been

introduced which provides a legal base for
SBV to create the regulatory sandbox with

powers for SBV to further regulate its design
(Art. 106).

Annex VIII. Improving the Production and Dissemination of
Economic Statistics—Challenges and Benefits 1
Vietnam has made progress in improving data quality and transparency, but significant gaps remain.
As Vietnam works towards achieving its ambitious development goals, it will be critical to strengthen
the quality of economic data. This is essential to the many aspects of monitoring economic
developments and risks, designing informed policies, and assessing the quality of public policies.
Improving transparency on economic data will also allow households, firms, and investors to make
better decisions. Improving economic statistics will require a significant legal and institutional effort,
including improving coordination and data sharing among government agencies.
1.
Vietnam has made progress in addressing data gaps and improving data quality, but
important weaknesses remain. Quarterly GDP expenditure components have been published since
2015 and have been compiled following the international standard since 2017. Employment data
has been compiled in line with the international standard since 2021. However, there is still much
room to improve data quality and availability in all the economic sectors. Based on the World Bank’s
Statistical Performance Indicators on data infrastructure that assess data hard infrastructure
(legislation, governance, standards) and soft infrastructure (skills, partnerships) as well as the
financial resource, 2 Vietnam (a score of 40 out of 100 for 2022) ranked below the scores of lower
middle income and East Asia Pacific countries (51.4 and 53.1 out of 100, respectively).
2.
Improving economic statistics yields a multitude of benefits, ranging from facilitating
evidence-based policymaking to enhancing transparency and governance. Granular and
comprehensive data available in a timely manner can enhance monitoring of economic
developments accurately in real time and enables policymakers to formulate informed policies. For
example, the large errors and omissions in the balance of payments could be driven by a few
different factors—including underreported imports, underestimated outward transfers, or
unrecorded capital outflows—which have very different implications for managing risks and
designing policies. Another example is the large revisions in the government final accounts, which
come with lengthy delays and makes it hard to determine the appropriate fiscal stance in real time
and plan policies ahead (Box 1). 3 Moreover, better data collection, compilation, and dissemination
would empower households, businesses, and investors to make informed decisions through
reducing uncertainty and improving transparency. For example, timely publication of accurate
government final accounts that are in line with international standards would provide international
investors with a better understanding of the fiscal situation and lead to more informed pricing of the
government bonds. 4 Developing property price indexes would not only help policymakers monitor

activities in the real estate sector, but also enable households and businesses to understand the
sectoral developments and make better decisions. Enhancing transparency of judiciary by publishing
court statistics and statistics on anti-corruption enforcement and prevention would also help to
effect long-term change and identify bottlenecks. Last but not the least, improved data reporting
and public dissemination would enhance accountability and governance by offering data-driven
evidence to assess the quality of public policies.
3.
Main regional commercial partners of Vietnam produce and disseminate
macroeconomic statistics with broader coverage, detailed granularity, adequate periodicity,
and appropriate timeliness for policy analysis and decision making. For example, Korea, Japan,
Thailand, and China are Special Data Dissemination Standard (SDDS) subscribers, while Vietnam is
an Enhance-General Data Dissemination System (e-GDDS) participant. 5 6 SDDS subscribers
disseminate a rich set of statistics that are expected to enhance the availability of comprehensive
statistics and, therefore, contribute to sound macroeconomic policies and facilitate access to capital
markets. 7

E-GDDS participants disseminate fewer comprehensive macroeconomic datasets compared to SDDS subscribers.

The SDDS include, among others, the following data dissemination good practices: production of international
investment position (IIP), reserve template, general government, including all extra-budgetary and social security
units, producer or whole prices, public and external debt, and monetary statistics with relevant disaggregates for
central bank and deposit taking corporations. All of them aligned to international standards.

Box 1. Vietnam: Fiscal Accounts: Budgeting, Reporting, and Accounting Issues
Annual budget has seen overly conservative revenue projections while not integrating carryover
spending. Revenue projections in the budget have been consistently lower than the revenue recorded in
the final fiscal accounts, with an annual average upside
deviation of 1.8 percent of GDP during 2010-21. Permitted
carryover spending, mostly on capital expenditure, is not
integrated in the annual budget, resulting in an annual
average of upside deviation of 1.1 percent of GDP during
the same period. Although conservative revenue
projections could help contain pressures to spend and
maintain fiscal prudence, it can also undermine the ability
to plan well as spending may be adjusted on an ad-hoc
approach, instead of consistent with a more realistic
medium-term plan. The unbudgeted carryover spending
makes it difficult to track actual spending and assess the
fiscal stance, reducing transparency.
Final fiscal accounts come with a significant lag and
major revisions from earlier-released estimates. Final
fiscal accounts are published after 18 months of the end of
the reporting fiscal year. Earlier-released estimates (one at
the year-end and another after six months) are subject to
major revisions. For example, revenue in the final fiscal
accounts was 2.5 percent of GDP higher than in the first
estimate while capital expenditure was 0.6 percent of GDP
higher in 2021, resulting a large upward revision in the
fiscal balance from -3.8 to -1.4 percent of GDP. Such
length delay and sizable revisions hamper timely
monitoring and assessment of the fiscal position.
Moreover, the fiscal accounting is not in line with the
Government Finance Statistics Manual 2014 (GFSM 2014).

Countries with robust legal and institutional frameworks for statistical production,
compilation, and dissemination performed generally better in terms of overall data quality. In
Vietnam, the 2010 Law on the State Bank assigns responsibilities for the production and
dissemination of monetary and BOP statistics to SBV but does not for international investment
position (IIP). Also, the SBV is entitled to limit the amount of granular data disseminated in the BOP
and monetary financial statistics and is allowed to share only BOP and monetary statistics with a
limited number of public institutions (including MOF, MPI, National Assembly). The MOF reports
budget information to the Executive branch and National Assembly in the context of budget
preparation. The State Budget Law (2015) defines functions of MOF and describes all the budget
process without explicit references to international accounting and statistical standards. The
Statistics Law (2015) and related decrees guarantee data sharing and coordination between the GSO
and ministries and regulate the state statistical information that should be kept confidential.
5.
Vietnam’s statistical legal framework and institutional data sharing arrangements are
not adequate to support the production and dissemination of macroeconomic and financial
data of good quality. Relevant changes in the current statistical legislation and improvements in
the institutional data sharing arrangements would be beneficial for: (1) a clear delineation of
responsibility for each area of macroeconomic statistics; (2) an adequate access to current data
sources produced by public and private units, (3) the development of new data sources (for instance,
the preparation of new surveys) and use of alternative data sources (for instance, the use of big
data), and (4) a better coordinated intra and inter-institutional data sharing. Improved institutional
arrangements also include training in the use of appropriate statistical techniques and
methodologies.
6.
Although Vietnam has adhered broadly to internationally accepted methodologies,
there are significant weaknesses in the coverage, classification, and sectorization of several
data sets. Fiscal statistics for policy analysis and intervention are hampered by weaknesses, often
owing to classification and sectorization that do not follow international standards. For external
sector statistics, an incomplete coverage of operations in the BOP (in the current account, mainly in
goods and services and in the financial accounts, mainly in direct investment, trade credits, and
currency and deposits) has generated significant errors and omissions. Also, policy analysis of the
external sector has been restricted since data of external assets and liabilities have not been
produced. For monetary statistics, the lack of granular data makes difficult the checking of
consistency with other macroeconomic datasets, and for national accounts, a slow improvement in
the methodologies used to prepare supporting information for the rebasing national account and in
the coverage of informal sector, has affected the quality of these data. Finally, for prices, sources for
the preparation (for instance, buyers and sellers of properties identified on a register of real estate
transactions) of the real estate price index are no longer collected after its legislative basis expires.
7.
Alignment to the international statistical standards will improve transparency and
governance. The primary purpose of this alignment is to provide a sound and comprehensive
conceptual and reporting framework suitable for developing, analyzing, and evaluating macro-

70

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

VIETNAM

economic policies. Several actions can be developed, or are already being implemented, to improve
the quality of the Vietnam statistics:
•

the implementation of a comprehensive migration plan to adopt GFSM 2014 methodology and
intensification of efforts to reduce the carry-on accounts and clear them at the end of the fiscal
year will assist in the reduction of discrepancies between above- and below-the line in GFS;

•

the preparation of standard reporting forms (SRF) of monetary statistics will provide users and
compilers with adequate granular data for monetary policy;

•

errors and omission in BOP will be reduced with the relaunching of direct investment survey, the
improvement in the coverage of goods and services, and the preparation of the IIP and reserve
template;

•

the 2020 supply and use tables (SUTs) and input-output tables (IOTs) should be finalized to
support the rebasing of the national account.

8.
To keep attuned to new demands for data for policy analysis and decision-making,
including by markets, Vietnam is encouraged to collect, compile, and publish new data
categories. The proposals cover macro-financial indicators and data on foreign exchange
intervention, digital trade, climate change related policy, and the gender disaggregation of the labor
force. This data production should take careful account of Vietnam’s capacity in term of technical,
financial, and human resources.

The overall risk of sovereign stress is low, reflecting relatively low levels of
vulnerability in the medium-term horizon and a low to moderate level of
vulnerability in the long term.

Medium-term risks are assessed as low, reflecting a stable fiscal outlook
and low gross financing needs. The fanchart analysis suggests that
baseline projections are reasonable and the public debt will remain low
and stable. GFN analysis indicates that financing needs remain low and
stable. Deepening geo-economic fragmentation is a risk that could affect
economic activities through intensified trade disputes and/or supply
disruptions while also bringing some upside from trade and FDI diversion.

DSA Summary Assessment

Commentary: Vietnam is at a low overall risk of sovereign stress. The public debt continued to fall since 2020 and is projected to
further decline; medium-term risks are assessed as low reflecting a stable fiscal outlook and low gross financing needs. Over the
longer run, Vietnam should strengthen risk-based fiscal frameworks, implement revenue-enhancing reforms, develop a sovereign
debt market, and continue with reforms to strengthen the authorities' debt management institutions to tackle any long-term risks
arising from population aging and climate change.

Sources: Fund staff.
Notes: The risk of sovereign stress is a broader concept than debt sustainability. Unsustainable debt can only be resolved through
exceptional measures (such as debt restructuring). In contrast, a sovereign can face stress without its debt necessarily being unsustainable,
and there can be various measures—that do not involve a debt restructuring—to remedy such a situation, such as fiscal adjustment and
new financing.

2/ A debt sustainability assessment is optional for surveillance-only cases and mandatory in cases where there is a Fund arrangement. The
mechanical signal of the debt sustainability assessment is deleted before publication. In surveillance-only cases or cases with IMF
arrangements with normal access, the qualifier indicating probability of sustainable debt ("with high probability" or "but not with high
probability") is deleted before publication.

Commentary: Public debt held by the Vietnam Social Security (VSS) is included in Vietnam’s definition of public debt. With cross-debt
holdings of about 10 percent of GDP, netting it out w ould currently reduce public debt by the same amount.

debt

Commentary: Public debt is projected to decline over the medium term, reflecting a stable fiscal outlook, strong GDP growth, and
stable macroeconomic conditions. Primary deficit is expected to remain relatively high in 2024 due to the public wages increases
and a partial recovery of revenues but is projected to decline and remain stable over the medium term . Growth picks up in the
near term but is projected to gradually decline due to demographic headwinds in the medium term. Despite the declining mediumterm growth, positive growth-interest differential and stable inflation keep the debt-to-GDP ratio in check. GFNs are projected to
slightly increase over the medium term because of the scheduled amortization of debt from larger primary deficits in 2023 and
2024, but are still at low levels and will decline afterwards.

Commentary: Realism analysis does not point to major concerns as past forecasts appear to be conservative and the
projections are well within norms. The primary deficit is projected to become the main driver of debt creation as the
generally tight fiscal policy in the past few years loosens.

real time/period ahead estimates and final estimates in the latest October WEO) in the total distribution of
revisions across the data sample.

Commentary: Investments to address climate adaptation will increase the long-term financing need. However, the government's planned ETS is expected to generate

significant revenues - ranging from 1.4 to 6.9 percent of GDP as estimated in the 2023 Article IV Staff Report - which could be used to finance climate adaptation. The
government is also committed to prioritizing investment toward climate adaptation.

Commentary: In the absence of measures, the mitigation spending need is high in the standardized scenario. However, the government's planned ETS will operate

starting 2028. It will help reduce the spending need and generate significant revenues - ranging from 1.4 to 6.9 percent of GDP as estimated in the 2023 Article IV Staff
Report - which could be used on shifting toward renewable energy.

Natural Resources

Commentary: Vietnam is an oil producer. In the absence of new discoveries, the exhaustion of the oil reserves in the long run would have negative impacts on the GFN
and public debt. However, given the small contribution of the natural resource sector to GDP , the sector’s influence on public debt is small.

Exchange Rate Arrangements
The de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as crawl-like while the de jure exchange rate
arrangement is managed floating. The State Bank of Vietnam (SBV) is gradually increasing exchangerate flexibility. In August 2015 it widened the VND/USD trading band to +/-3 percent from +/-1
percent while devaluing the central parity by one percent. SBV further widened its trading band to
+/-5 percent from +/-3 percent in October 2022. In January 2016 it announced the VND/USD rate
would be adjusted daily based on (i) the previous day’s weighted average dong/USD exchange rate;
(ii) a weighted average of movements in dong exchange rates vis-à-vis seven other important
trading partners’ currencies; and (iii) domestic macroeconomic conditions.

Vietnam has accepted the obligations under Article VIII, Section 2(a), 3, and 4 of the IMF’s Articles of
Agreement and maintains an exchange system free of multiple currency practices and restrictions on
the making of payments and transfers for current international transactions, except for those
exchange restrictions imposed for security reasons, which have been notified to the IMF pursuant to
Executive Board Decision No. 144-(52/51), 8/14/52.
Article IV Consultations
Vietnam is on a 12-month consultation cycle. The previous Article IV consultation was held in-person
during June 14-29, 2023, and was concluded by the Executive Board on August 30, 2023.
Technical Assistance
In recent years, Vietnam has received technical assistance (TA) in the areas of statistics (government
finance, external sector, price, and national accounts), reserve management, debt management, tax
administration, fiscal risks, liberalization of capital controls on external debt, foreign exchange
management, macroeconomic frameworks, and forecasting and policy analysis system (FPAS). The
last IMF-World Bank Financial Sector Assessment Program was undertaken during 2012–13, and the
Financial Sector Stability Review (FSSR) took place during 2021–23.
In 2019, the IMF’s Institute for Capacity Development (ICD) started a multi-year TA on FPAS. In early
2022, Phase I of FPAS TA on modelling capacity was successfully completed and Phase II on
developing organizational FPAS processes started in April 2022.
In 2022 and 2023, the IMF’s Fiscal Affairs Department and the Capacity Development Center of
Thailand (CDOT) have provided TA on tax administration and compliance risk management,
strengthening Vietnam Treasury’s cash management, internal audit, and chart of accounts. TA and
training were also provided for the formulation of medium-term debt strategy, debt management
institutional arrangement, custom modernization, and pension fund modeling. The IMF’s Monetary
and Capital Markets Department (MCM) started a multi-year project on strengthening the SBV
Internal Audit in August 2022. The IMF’s Legal Department (LEG) started a multi-year project to help
SBV and relevant government agencies strengthen AML/CFT legal frameworks and risk-based AML
supervision in November 2022. The IMF’s Statistics Department (STA) provided TA on Government
Finance Statistics and External Sector Statistics (with CDOT), Prices Statistics and National Accounts.
In April 2023, STA provided a TA to help the SBV transition to the new FSIs compiling format and in
November 2023, STA/CDOT provided a TA to assist the MOF in the preparation of GFS aligned to
international standards. In April 2024, STA/CDOT provided TAs to help SBV in improving FDI and
identifying sources of errors and omissions. Also, in April 2024, STA TAs have been provided for the
rebasing of national accounts and the development of Residential Property Price Indices. A scoping
mission for an FSSR took place in 2021, with a full FSSR finalized in June 2023. The FSSR report was
approved by the SBV management. An FSSR follow-up mission was undertaken during June 2024
alongside this Article IV mission to discuss a medium-term CD program with the SBV, State Securities
Commission, and MOF following key recommendations from the FSSR. In 2023, ICD/CDOT started a

Statement by Ms. Yati Kurniati and Ms. Vi Thi Tra Nguyen on Vietnam Executive Board
Meeting
August 30, 2024

The authorities of Viet Nam express their gratitude to the Mission Chief, Mr. Paulo Medas, and
his team for their open and constructive discussion during the AIV mission. They also appreciate
the candidness and thoughtful consideration underpinned the staff’s advice. The authorities
broadly agree with the staff’s assessment of the outlook and the thrust of recommendations.
Recent Economic Development and Outlook
Viet Nam Economy continues to have a robust outlook. By June 2024, GDP growth reached
6.93% y.o.y, the second highest level during 2020-2024, surpassed only by the same period in
June 2022. CPI increased by 1.40% y.t.d and by 4.34% y.o.y. Average CPI level was at 4.08%
y.o.y, while core inflation was 2.75% with a subsiding trend since the year began. Building on
updated economic developments and positive signs of recovery, the authorities are confident that
2024 GDP growth will be within the targeted range of 6-6.5% and inflation at 4-4.5%. This
optimism is driven by the recovery of industrial and agricultural production, strong service
performance as well as prudent macro-economic policy response.
Growth in 2024 and 2025 is expected to gear to the medium-term potential when global
economic recovery continues, and central banks are anticipated to lower policy rates to support
economic recovery in later half of 2024. These will boost external demand and result in
increased orders to Vietnamese exporters. Additionally, the economy is expected to benefit from
lagged effects of various incentives and supportive policy measures which were introduced in
2023, including lower interest rates, higher public investment, tax cuts, reduced fees and levies.
FDI is also projected to remain robust.
Fiscal policy
Total fiscal revenue for the first six month of 2024 reached 1,020.6 trillion dong, accounting for
60% of 2024 the projected revenue for the year and marking a 15.7% (y.o.y) increase. Total
budget expenditure by June 2024 was 803.6 trillion dong, accounting for 37.9% of the planned
budget. The Government remains committed to fiscal consolidation, strong adherence to budget
disciplines and to improve budget efficiency and transparency.
The authorities focused on accelerating public investment and disbursement, especially for
nationally prioritized projects which were planned to channel social resources to important areas
of the national development programs. In the first 6 months, total public investment
disbursement amounted to 244,4 trillion dong, equivalent to 33.8% of the annual plan and an

increase of 3.5% y.o.y. The Government has requested ministries and subordinate agencies to
review the implementation of the 2021-2025 Public Investment Strategy and to provide inputs
for the next five-year public investment plan towards 2030.
To support economic recovery in the post pandemic period, several taxes, fees and levies have
been cut in 2023 and are expected to remain in effect until the end of 2024. In 2022, the
Government issued the Taxation Reform Strategy towards 2030, which aims to uniformly
improve the taxation system in line with international best practices, while securing necessary
funding for socio-economic development programs. Provincial authorities have been introducing
the use of information technology to facilitate online tax registration and collection for
individuals and businesses.
The authorities are currently reviewing the implementation of 2021-2025 Budget Plan as the
initial step in preparing the next five-year fiscal plan. For the 2026-2030 period, the national
budget is expected to focus on nationally important projects, programs, inter-provincial and
international initiatives that will drive growth momentum in the related provinces and areas,
ultimately improving lives of the people.
Monetary policy
Monetary policies were conducted in close collaboration with other policies to maintain
macroeconomic stability and support economic recovery. In 2023, in line with other Government
supportive policies, the State Bank of Vietnam (SBV) cut policy interest rates 4 times to preCovid levels in efforts to help businesses revive activities that were hampered by the pandemic
slowdown.
Global market fluctuation and the appreciation of major currencies had a pass-through effect on
VND exchange rates. In response, the SBV flexibly regulated its policy tools to absorb external
shocks, adjusted VND supply and used foreign exchange intervention to ease pressure on
exchange rate. As a results, VND/USD exchange rates moved flexibly in both directions,
aligning with regional market trends. Hence, FX markets was stabilized, legitimate demands for
foreign currencies were met and inflation kept within target levels. The SBV will continue to
allow necessary space for exchange rate flexibility to align with market developments, helping to
absorb external shocks. It will stand ready to intervene to stabilize the FX market and contain
excessive exchange rate fluctuations.
The SBV has undertaken various reforms to improve its monetary policy framework and
enhance transmission efficiency. The Banking Development Strategy which was issued in 2018
emphasized strengthening the SBV’s functions and mandates in line with a modern central bank
model, improving its analytical and forecasting capability, accountability and transparency,

2

gradually moving from quantity-based to price-based monetary policy. With assistance from the
Fund under a technical assistance program since 2019, the SBV has developed a Forecasting and
Policy Analysis System (FPAS), which is expected to provide critical inputs for policy decision
and public communication. The final phase of public communication is scheduled to begin in
late 2024.
Financial sector
Market liquidity remained stable throughout 2023 and the first six months of 2024, with all
banks adhering to the SBV’s regulatory prudential limits, safety ratios and governance
requirements. The SBV continued its plan to introduce additional macroprudential tools and
requirements to promote sound performance of the banking system and sustain financial
stability.
Following various policy measures by the authorities, the corporate bond market stabilized, and
bond issuance resumed in the latter half of 2023. In December 2023, the Prime Minister issued
the Securities Market Development Strategy towards 2030 aiming at sustaining a sound and
effective capital market. For the corporate bond market, the strategy includes plans to implement
higher requirement for issuance, disclosure, credit rating to improve quality of bond products.
The authorities are committed to stronger supervision of capital markets to protect investor and
maintain financial stability.
On August 1st, 2024, the Law on Land, the Law on Housing and the Law on Real Estate Trading
came into effect, five months earlier than initially planned. The authorities believe that these
three new laws governing housing and real estate market will promote a more transparent and
sustainable property market.
The newly revised Law on Credit Institutions took effect on July 1st, 2024, and is expected to
promote sound operation of the banking system by introducing stricter requirements for
provisioning, governance, management qualification, thereby promoting transparency and
compelling banks to innovate themselves to improve their competitiveness and meet evolving
market demands. The 2024 Law on Credit Institution also empowers SBV with early
intervention capabilities, guidelines and authority to resolve bank failures, including bank-run
and special control cases. On the other hand, domestic and foreign banks are required to develop
their own continuity and resolution plans, which will facilitate SBV’s timely and efficient
intervention when needed.
The Vietnamese banking system continues to implement the 2021-2025 Restructuring Plan to
consolidate its financial capacity, improve assets quality, and promote sound performance and
transparency. Under this plan, banks are required to enhance their capital base, capital adequacy,

3

risk management and governance in line with international best practices. Except for banks under
the SBV’s special control, all other banks have been meeting the requirements of the
Restructuring Plans and in compliance with SBV regulations. The SBV has planned the merger
and acquisition of three banks currently under its special control after a period of consolidation.
For SCB, the SBV is preparing a compulsory merger plan to submit to the Prime Minister for
approval.
Structural reforms
The authorities stay committed to strengthening the statistical system in compliance with
international standards. Since 2015, the SBV received technical assistance from the Fund to
build its capacity in compiling the International Investment Position (IIP) and carried out several
pilot IIP projects, with reports shared with staff. The authorities have been working closely on
revising related laws and regulations to enable publication of Viet Nam’s IIP. The Law on
Statistics, issued in 2021, provides the necessary legal framework for collection and composition
of key statistical indicators as required by advanced statistical standards. In 2020, the Prime
Minister approved Statistics Development Strategy for the 2021-2030 period, aiming to upgrade
statistical systems across all economic sectors and areas, including progressing toward SDDS
adherence. The SBV and other authorities have been working closely with STA on various CD
projects to enhance their capability in modern statistical methodologies and compilation.
Following the release of Viet Nam’s Mutual Evaluation Report on AML/CFT by the Asia/Pacific
Group on Money Laundering (APG) in February 2022, the authorities undertook decisive
measures to address identified gaps and weaknesses. The newly revised Law on AML and its
implementation guidelines were issued in late 2022 and early 2023. National Risk Assessment
Report for 2018-2022 was completed, covering new areas such as risks from virtual assets,
pollution, criminal legal entities, legal arrangements, and underlined beneficiaries. The
Government also issued a Post-Evaluation National Action Plan to address the constraints
highlighted in the mutual evaluation. Additionally, Guidelines on Inter- ministerial Cooperation
were issued to promote collaboration between relevant authorities and law enforcement agencies
(LEAs) on AML/CFT efforts. Viet Nam’s Financial Intelligent Unit (FIU) has signed several
memoranda of agreement with other government ministries, agencies and foreign FIUs on the
provision and sharing of AML/CFT information and analytical works. The FIU has also been
working to upgrade its technological infrastructure and system to improve data collection and
analysis in support of LEAs’ works in accordance with AML/CFT laws and regulations.
As a country with highly risky exposure to climate change, Viet Nam has been actively
participating in international initiatives and forums including COP and Just Energy Transition
Partnership (JETP) as one of its first members. The Climate Change Strategy towards 2050 plans

4

to reach net zero emission by 2050 and outlines measures to channel resources to climate
adaptation plans. These include building financial infrastructure, establishing carbon markets and
promoting investment shifts toward low-emission economic development. The authorities aim to
leverage state resources to encourage participation of social organizations, private businesses,
individuals, and international organizations, fostering public-private partnerships based on
principles of cooperation and mutual benefits. In December 2023, the Prime Minister announced
Viet Nam Resource Mobilization Plan to implement JETP (RMP) in COP 28 meeting. The
authorities have been focusing on reviewing related projects, programs and working with
domestic and international partners to seek funding for the RMP. The authorities are working to
develop necessary legal framework for financial infrastructure including carbon market and
collaborating with credit institutions to develop green financial products.
Over 10 years of implementing the National Anti-Corruption Strategy and United Nations
Convention against Corruption (UNCAC) Action Plan, significant improvement and important
outcomes have been made in curbing and preventing corruption. In 2023, Viet Nam Corruption
Perception Index was 41/100, ranking 80 out of 180 countries on the global list, a substantial
improvement from its 120th place ranking in 2009. The 2018 Anti- Corruption Law was enacted
to prevent, detect and address corruption and other violations of anti-corruption law. With
political determination and decisive actions, anti-corruption efforts will help strengthen and
discipline within the administrative governance system, creating a fair and civilized social
environment that supports socio-economic development.
