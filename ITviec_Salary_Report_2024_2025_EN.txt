DISCLAIMER
The salary and information in this report were determined by analyzing the responses from 2,324
qualiﬁed respondents across proﬁles such as IT professionals, freelancers, IT students, HR
leaders and CxOs. The inclusion of this data by ITviec is intended only to provide general insights
into ﬁndings for the stated positions/groups and does not indicate a conﬁrmation of its validity.
Whilst every effort has been made to ensure the accuracy of the statistics in the report, ITviec
cannot be held responsible for any errors or omissions, or for the results obtained from the use of
the report information. If you wish to use copyrighted materials from this report for purposes of
your own that go beyond fair use, you must obtain written permission from ITviec.
Median salary
Median salary is the middle value in the set of data that was sorted. For instance, the sorted
salary value data set for Back-end Developers with 1 to 3 years of experience are as follows:
26, 27, 28, 28, 28, 28, 30, 31, 31, 32, 34
The set contains 11 data numbers. The middle value of the data set is 28.
> Median salary is 28.
Or 28, 28, 28, 28, 30, 31, 31, 32, 34, 60, 66, 82, 85, 85
The set contains 14 data numbers. The middle value of the data set is 31 and 32.
> Median salary is (31 + 32) / 2 = 31.5.
The median number of years of experience is calculated in the same way as the median salary.
Average salary
Average salary is the result of the formula below:
(sum of salaries in speciﬁed group) / (amount of respondents) = average salary
For instance, average salary of IT professionals in Ho Chi Minh City is:
(13 + 18 + 34 + 32 + 54 + 76 + 90 + 34 + 45 + 20) / 10 = 41.6
Percentage
Percentages may not always equal 100% due to variations in the types of questions and
answers, and minor rounding for long attribute lists. Some questions and answers are altered
based on the respondent’s previous responses. In some cases, the distribution of answers for
certain questions exceeded 100% due to the checklist answer type. Respondents were allowed
to select more than one answer, up to a maximum of 10.
Order of IT professional levels in the report
Please note that the appearance of the "Expert/Consultant" level in 6th place, after the
“C-level” range, does not indicate a hierarchical ranking of management levels. This ordering
is for illustrative purposes only and does not reﬂect the actual organizational hierarchy.

Key Takeaways

Strategic Vietnam’s IT hiring shift: 38.7% of companies embrace “no
growth/reduction” in IT teams for 1st half 2025, driven by AI
productivity implementation.
Vietnam’s IT hiring planning reached a pivotal moment in 1H 2025, with 38.7% of companies recording "no
growth/reduction" plans—the highest rate since 2020 (0%). (page 33)
A closer look at historical data reveals a dramatic shift: between 2020 and 2022, "no growth/reduction" plans
were negligible, averaging just 2%. From 2023 onward, this trend surged to 28% averagely, climbing nearly 10%
annually to reach 38.7% by 1H 2025.
Key drivers behind these strategic adjustments include reduced new project pipelines (17.6% in 2024 to 23.1% in
1H 2025) and increased emphasis on AI-driven productivity implementation, with the recorded percentage
rising from 5.9% in 2024 to 15.4% in 1H 2025. (page 38)
Interestingly, actual employment outcomes frequently deviated from initial planning, with organizations
recording previous year’s actual growth with expansion, most likely due to updated revenue or increased
production demand. For instance, companies that experienced growth observed a rise in "high growth (31 50%)" from 2022 to 2023 (14.1% compared to 27.8%), which contrasted with the planning status (30.6% in 2022
planning versus 19.8% in 2023 planning). (page 33)
From ITviec's perspective, while there may be annual updates and changes due to market ﬂuctuations, these
trends still represent a strategic and long-term shift toward a sustainable IT hiring model, where productivity
and cost-efficiency take precedence—allowing decision-makers to align with the global VUCA situation.

After years of having more demand than supply, the Vietnam’s IT
market has shown a more balance between supply and demand as
challenges in candidate quality and salary expectations have eased.
The IT job market in Vietnam is showing a more balanced alignment between supply and demand, with
signiﬁcant reductions in challenges related to candidate quality and salary expectations.
In 2023, “quality of candidates lower than expectation” was cited as the biggest challenge by IT companies, with
86.1% agreement. By the ﬁrst half of 2024, this ﬁgure dropped sharply to 55.8%, marking a decrease of 30.3%.
Salary-related challenges followed a similar downward trend. The proportion of companies reporting “too many
candidates expecting higher salaries than the company can offer” fell from 47.2% in 2023 to 27.9% in the ﬁrst
half of 2024. (page 35)

On the IT professionals’ side, salary expectations
for new job offers have shifted. The expected
increase dropped from 31% in 2023–2024 to 27% in
2024–2025. Junior/Fresh IT professionals led salary
increase expectations for both new job offers
(32.9%) and current jobs (20.3%) in 2024-2025. In
contrast, Senior-level professionals had the lowest
salary increase expectations for new job offers in
2024–2025, at 24.9%. (page 57)

Moreover, employers also reported a decline in salary increase for new IT hires in the ﬁrst half of 2024 compared
to 2023 (33.6% in 1H 2024 versus 37.5% in 2023). (page 37)
These ﬁgures suggest that the balance between IT professionals’ expectations and employers’ needs has
improved more than ever. However, salary dynamics and candidate quality remain key factors to monitor in the
years to come.

Key Takeaways

Top in-demand technical skills, positions, programming languages in
IT recruitment 1H 2025 hold no surprises. Gap in English proﬁciency
will limit IT professionals from meeting soft skill expectations.
Technical roles such as Back-end and Full-stack developers (56.1% each) are leading demand in 1H 2025,
followed by Front-end developers (34.8%) and Testers (28.8%). On the programming side, JavaScript (46.3%)
dominates, with React.js (41.9%) and .NET (30.6%) standing out among frameworks and libraries. In terms of
technical skills, professionals with expertise in Project Management (Agile, Scrum) and API Development (31.8%
each), as well as DevOps and Automation tools (CI/CD, Kubernetes) (28.8%), are more likely to make it to the
top-qualiﬁed list. (page 39)
However, technical skills alone are insufficient to thrive in a globally connected industry. While IT professionals
excel in problem-solving (72%), logical thinking (62.5%), and teamwork (60.6%), critical gaps in English
proﬁciency remain a signiﬁcant hurdle. Employers have ranked English proﬁciency as the top in-demand soft
skill for 1H 2025 (40.3%), reﬂecting its importance for global collaboration and leadership. At the same time,
47.1% of IT professionals prioritize improving English speaking skills, and 32.1% focus on listening skills. This
mutual recognition from employers and professionals underscores the urgent need to bridge the English skill
gap for a more sustainable and competitive IT workforce. (page 50)
To bridge these gaps of English and other skills, IT professionals are turning to ﬂexible learning methods,
including free online resources (59.6%), work-based learning (58.1%), and online courses (56.9%). (page 51 - 52)

40.9% of IT professionals plan to leave their jobs within a year.
Common reasons are salary dissatisfaction and career growth
concerns. Having positive company reviews alone does not guarantee
strong employer branding image.
40.9% of IT professionals plan to leave their jobs within the next 12 months, signaling signiﬁcant shifts in the job
market. This presents an opportunity for companies to attract talent by understanding the job search journey.
The most common reasons include salary dissatisfaction (34.2%), career shifts (26.3%), and a lack of career
development opportunities (22.3%). These reasons remain consistent across most roles but vary signiﬁcantly at
the management level. C-level professionals are more likely to leave due to a political working environment, lack
of company or product growth potential, and career shifts. (page 53)
Job-seeking behaviors also differ by seniority. While junior and mid-level IT professionals actively browse job
sites, higher-level roles like C-level executives rely more on passive job invitations. Among most effective
job-seeking channels, ITviec ranks as the top choice, rated effective by 40.4% of respondents. (page 54)
IT professionals’ priorities when researching new job opportunities shift based on career levels. Juniors to
manager-level professionals focus heavily on employee reviews (70%) and beneﬁts (57%), while C-level
executives prioritize company history, product portfolio, and domain expertise (52.5%). Experts and consultants
emphasize beneﬁts and perks (67.7%) more than any other level. (page 56)
Employer branding plays a crucial role in attracting IT professionals. Long-term employee retention (50%) is a
key indicator of a positive employer brand, valued across all career levels. However, positive employee reviews
alone (25%) are insufficient. Companies that demonstrate tangible evidence of retaining talent and delivering
performance growth are perceived as stronger employers. (page 56)
These insights suggest that companies aiming to retain and attract IT talent should align their employer
branding strategies with what professionals value most while leveraging effective channels like ITviec to
connect with potential candidates.

Pharmaceuticals industry tops IT salary charts at 71.2 million
VND/month averagely, with Real Estate, Property, Construction and
Agriculture overtaking Banking and Financial Services.
Pharmaceuticals continue to lead as the highest-paying industry for IT professionals in Vietnam, with an
average salary of 71.2 million VND/month—a signiﬁcant 46.5% increase from last year’s 47.9 million
VND/month. (page 69)
Real Estate, Property, and Construction climbed to second place at 57.3 million VND/month, followed closely
by Agriculture at 56 million VND/month. These two sectors surpassed Banking (46.3 million VND/month, now
ranked 10th) and Financial Services (50.5 million VND/month, now ranked 7th), which were leaders in previous
year but have fallen behind the new top three. (page 69)
Regionally, Staffing & Recruiting emerged as the highest-paying industry in Danang, offering 81.5
million VND/month—nearly doubling last year’s leader, the Game industry, which averaged 44.5 million
VND/month. (page 69)
In Hanoi, Real Estate, Property, and Construction lead with an average of 69.9 million VND/month, followed
by Telecommunications at 52.6 million VND/month. (page 69)
In Ho Chi Minh City, Pharmaceuticals dominate the salary charts at 85.3 million VND/month, with Agriculture
(67.8 million VND/month) and AI, Blockchain, and Deep Tech (61.5 million VND/month) rounding out the top
three. (page 69)
These trends highlight interesting shifts in IT salary distribution across industries and regions, reﬂecting new
priorities and opportunities for IT professionals nationwide.

Key Takeaways

IT professionals now have fewer work-from-home days per week
compared to last year, with the average dropping from 3 to 2 days.
Non-IT business companies offer the fewest WFH days per week.
This year’s survey reveals a noticeable decline in work-from-home (WFH) days per week for IT professionals. In
2023, the highest average was 3 WFH days per week, reported by 29.5% of respondents. This year, the highest
proportion shifted to 2 WFH days per week, with 32.2% reporting this arrangement. (page 47)
Non-IT businesses offer the least ﬂexibility, averaging 1.9 WFH days per week. In contrast, IT Outsourcing, IT
Product, and IT Service & Consulting companies provide higher range, around 2.3 days per week. (page 47)
For IT professionals prioritizing remote and hybrid work, companies originating from Europe, Australia, and New
Zealand provide the most attractive options. These organizations not only have higher adoption rates for hybrid
work but also lead in average WFH days per week, offering 2.4 and 2.8 days, respectively. (page 47)
While WFH remains one of the top three criteria for evaluating job offers—highlighted by 35.9% of IT
professionals in this year’s report—it is recommended for IT professionals to consider a balanced approach,
weighing other criteria alongside their preferences for remote work. (page 47)

AI adoption surges: 68.5% of IT professionals in software
development use AI for code completion. 50% of AI & Blockchain
professionals rate it highly accurate (51 – 80%).
This year’s research highlights widespread adoption of AI tools and GenAI across IT expertise areas. Key use
cases include:
•

Code completion: Used by 68.5% of software development professionals, 68.8% of AI & Blockchain
specialists, and 60.4% of data analytics expertise group.

•

Code refactoring: Used the most by AI & Blockchain group (45.3%) and software development (45.9%).

•

Information gathering/research: Adopted by 54.8% of product management and 54.7% of data
analytics professionals.

•

Key Takeaways

Well-deﬁned tasks, clear communication, ﬁnancial security, and
ﬂexibility are key to enhancing IT productivity and engagement,
particularly among the youngest group of IT employees.
IT productivity and engagement indices reveal signiﬁcant disparities across roles and demographics,
underscoring the need for strategic improvements. Compared to the average Productivity Index of 71, senior
roles such as C-level executives score the highest (78), Senior IT professionals (70), while junior IT roles
(Junior/Fresher) report the lowest productivity levels (68). (page 72)
Among company types, IT Outsourcing (72), IT Products (71), and IT Services (71) lag behind non-IT businesses
(75), highlighting areas for enhancement. From IT professionals’ perspective, three key factors critical to
productivity remain under-addressed:
•

Well-deﬁned tasks and projects: 46% importance vs. 21% company implementation.

•

Clear and transparent communication: 37.4% importance vs. 18.3% implementation.

•

Effective coordination and knowledge sharing: 36.6% importance vs. 18.8% implementation.

On the engagement side, the Employee Engagement Index (EEI) shows contrasts between levels. While senior
roles such as Manager/Lead (76), C-level executives (80) and Experts/Consultants (85) have the highest scores,
the Junior/Fresher employees and youngest age groups (20–22 and 23–26) struggle with engagement, scoring
just 67, 23 and 62, respectively. (page 74)
Financial security remains a top engagement driver, with IT professionals prioritizing competitive salaries
(53.6%), annual salary increases (45.5%) and 100% salary insurance (43.2%). Flexible working model, highly
valued by 32.2% of professionals, are being implemented by just 2.4% of companies. (page 75)
For general IT professionals' productivity and engagement enhanced, particularly for younger IT employees
who need help in quickly adjusting and achieving work delivery standards, HR leaders and CxOs should consider
to address these crucial gaps.

10

Web, mobile apps, consulting and AI/ML development projects
dominate Vietnam’s freelance IT market. Cash ﬂow, high-competitive
landscape and client reliability remain the most challenging factors.
Key freelance project categories for Vietnamese IT professionals include Web Development (55%), Mobile App
Development (33%), and Project Consulting (25.7%). The United States provides the largest share of freelance

Key Takeaways

To succeed in the increasingly competitive IT job market, IT students must
proactively build practical experience, strengthen their problem-solving
skills, and improve their English proﬁciency as soon as possible.
The current state of IT students is marked by signiﬁcant stress, with many struggling to balance the pressures
of their studies and the job market. In this year’s report, 53% of students feel discouraged due to a lack of
practical experience, an inadequate curriculum, and inconsistent teaching quality. As a result, over half (50.7%)
worry about securing employment after graduation, which is signiﬁcantly higher than the concerns regarding
job ﬁt (12.7%) or lack of practical experience (9.9%). (page 84)
However, despite these challenges, a positive trend emerges. 43% of IT students have participated in internship
jobs, with 67.5% of these internships offering paid opportunities, and an average gross monthly income of 5
million dong. (page 84)
English language proﬁciency is highly critical for IT students’ success. With 40.3% of employers prioritizing
English proﬁciency in new IT hires, this year’s result marks a striking priority for this soft skill. However, many IT
professionals still struggle with English and plan to improve, even with senior levels. (page 53)
Alongside language skills, Agile/Scrum and adaptability are equally crucial with 38.8% and 37.3% employers plan
to recruit in 1H 2025. (page 53)
IT students who focus on developing these competencies in early stage will be better equipped to face
challenges and secure valuable career opportunities in the evolving job market.

IT Market Overview

LABOR FORCE IS A COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE (1)
By investing in upskilling programs, fostering industry-academia collaboration, and embracing technological
innovation, Vietnam can transform its limitations into strengths, ensuring sustainable growth in its IT labor market.
1. Young Workforce
Vietnam is in a critical phase of demographic transition,
characterized by a growing proportion of working-age
individuals compared to dependents. This young,
tech-savvy workforce is a key driver of the country’s
economic growth.Among Asia’s major digital economies,
Vietnam’s population pyramid offers a clear advantage
over nations like Japan and South Korea, where the
working-age population is forecasted to decline
signiﬁcantly by 2060. However, Vietnam’s demographic
advantage is temporary, with the World Bank projecting
signiﬁcant population aging by 2035, potentially shrinking
its pool of young talent.

According to Deloitte analysis based on statistics from
United Nation, Economist Intelligence Unit, Vietnam GSO,
Vietnam is projected to become the third aging society by
2035, following Singapore (in 2015) and Thailand (expected
in 2025). (Vietnam Investment Review, 2024)
Meanwhile, countries like the Philippines, Malaysia, and
Indonesia also enjoy a similar "golden population"
phase. To sustain growth, Vietnam must prioritize
upskilling its workforce, strengthen industry - academia
collaboration, and embrace technological innovation.
These steps are vital for maintaining a competitive and
adaptable workforce in a rapidly changing global
market. (The World Bank, Population Pyramid)

Report from ITviec (page 45) reveals that an
impressive 86% of IT professionals in Vietnam
hold qualiﬁcations from colleges or universities,
with 7.5% obtaining master's degrees. Additionally,
83.7% have an IT background from Vietnamese
formal system universities, particularly among
developers and engineers. This strong educational
foundation is critical for fostering a skilled
workforce capable of driving technological
advancements
Vietnam is also experiencing a surge in
innovation, ranking 44th globally in the 2024
Global Innovation Index (GII), climbing two
positions from the previous year (46th). Among
low middle-income countries, Vietnam ranks 2nd,
just behind India and ahead of the Philippines.
According to the GII 2024 recap, Vietnam leads
the world in high-tech exports, high-tech imports,
and creative goods exports. The country also
shines in labor productivity growth, ranking 3rd,
and mobile app creation, ranking 7th, showcasing
its growing role as a global innovation hub.
(Global Innovation Index - GII)
However, Vietnam faces a signiﬁcant skills gap.
According to ILOSTAT, only 9% of occupations in
Vietnam were classiﬁed as high-skilled in 2021. In
comparison, over 50% of jobs in the United
Kingdom fell into the high-skilled category. Closer
to the region, nearly 65% of workers in Singapore
hold high-skilled roles, highlighting a stark
contrast and the need for Vietnam to enhance its
workforce capabilities. (World Bank Blog)

Mr. Nguyen Van Khoa, CEO of FPT
Corporation, acknowledged that the
shortage of high-quality human resources
remains a signiﬁcant challenge. He shared,
"The FPT team has discussed several times
how to improve quality to compete with
major tech corporations like those in India.
A Vietnamese person must be as effective
as three Indians to be equal to them."
Nevertheless, he affirmed that Vietnamese
talent is not inferior in terms of skill level.
(CafeF)
Another critical area for IT professionals in Vietnam
is improving their English communication skills.

Ms. Dang Thien Kim, CEO of Globish Vietnam,
an online training organization with the
philosophy
"Global
Language
Comprehensive
Connection,"
offering
specialized English courses for the IT
industry, shared, “IT professionals in Vietnam
often struggle in speciﬁc situations that
include
participating
in
international
meetings, delivering presentations to diverse
audiences, and engaging in technical
discussions that require precise English
language and vocabulary.”
On the bright side, with the growing demand for
cross-border learning and collaboration driven by
advanced technologies like GenAI, IT professionals in Vietnam have shown signiﬁcant interest in
prioritizing improvements to their English speaking and listening skills in 2025. (page 50)
In conclusion, while Vietnam's IT sector demonstrates strong educational foundations and innovative capabilities, addressing the skills gap and
improving language proﬁciency will be crucial for
maintaining its competitive advantage in the
regional and global IT landscape.

IT Market Overview

LABOR FORCE IS A COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE (3)
Vietnam is a competitive hub for IT professionals due to lower hiring costs, but it must improve
productivity and invest in education and technology to maintain its global status.
3. Competitive wages
Vietnam has positioned itself as a competitive IT
professional, especially when compared to both
regional and developed markets. The lower cost
of hiring IT talent in Vietnam makes it an
appealing choice for companies seeking to
optimize their budgets while still accessing skilled
labor.
Compared to the regional countries, currently,
hourly rates for IT professionals in Vietnam
typically range from $20 to $40. This pricing
structure reinforces Vietnam's competitive edge
within the region. For comparison, the Philippines
charges between $25 and $50 per hour (Outsource
Accelerator), while India also falls within the same
range (NASSCOM). Malaysia's rates are similar,
though its operational costs can be higher.
When viewed alongside developed countries,
Vietnam's rates are signiﬁcantly lower. In the
United States, rates range from $62 to $209 per
hour, and in Western Europe, they often exceed
$60. In Australia, IT professionals charge between
$60 and $100 per hour, further highlighting
Vietnam's affordability. (LTS Group)
While competitive pricing is a crucial factor,
productivity also signiﬁcantly enhances the
overall value proposition of Vietnam's IT sector.
The ﬁndings from ITviec Salary & Recruitment
Market Report 2024-2025 shows that Vietnamese
IT professionals perform strongly in key areas.
They scored 7.7/10 for consistently meeting
targets, indicating alignment with organizational
goals, and 7.3/10 for less likely needing to rework
tasks. Additionally, scores of 8.2/10 and 8.6/10 for
meeting deadlines and taking ownership
demonstrate a strong commitment to time
management and accountability. Overall, the
workforce is considered to be goal-oriented,
efficient, and dedicated.

Although Vietnam's labor productivity has
improved in many terms, it remains signiﬁcantly
lower than other countries in the region. In 2022,
Vietnam's productivity was just 11.4% of
Singapore's, 24.7% of South Korea's, and 26.3% of
Japan's (VOV World). As Vietnam continues
investing in education and technological
infrastructure, signiﬁcant improvements in the
productivity of IT professionals and the broader
labor force are expected. Enhancing digital
literacy and technical skills will be crucial to
sustaining a competitive workforce in the rapidly
evolving global market. The government's focus
on developing the digital economy, as outlined in
various national strategies, is likely to further
boost the overall productivity of the sector.
In conclusion, Vietnam's competitive wages,
coupled with a commitment to improving
productivity, position it as an attractive
destination for IT professionals. By continuing to
invest in education and technology, Vietnam can
reinforce its status in the global IT market,
ensuring sustainable growth and competitiveness.

AI SET FOR EXPLOSIVE GROWTH IN 2025 (2)
According to Microsoft, the uncoordinated use of
AI by employees can lead to missed opportunities
for fully leveraging its capabilities and may
heighten the risk of data security breaches. Ms.
Nguyen Quynh Tram, General Director of Microsoft Vietnam, highlighted that AI usage among
Vietnamese workers is higher than the global
average. It is now being applied beyond simple
tasks like translation and summarization, moving
into more creative roles. Despite this progress,
support for AI adoption from leadership remains
low, which is at odds with global trends.

Vietnam needs to further promote
mechanisms that encourage organizations,
businesses, and leaders not only to
experiment with AI but to integrate it as a
primary tool to achieve business objectives
and optimize organizational efficiency.

IT Market Overview

AI ADOPTION IN VIETNAM
In recent years, despite Vietnam having made
signiﬁcant strides in its artiﬁcial intelligence (AI)
development and application efforts, in recently,
Vietnam is currently in a developing stage of AI
adoption. The Vietnam AI Preparedness Index
(developed by The International Monetary Fund,
2023) ranked the nation 78th out of 173 countries
in 2023, with a score of 0.48, indicating a gap in
readiness for AI development, particularly in
areas such as ethics and Regulatory Compliance,
Infrastructure Limitations, Shortage of Skilled
Workforce, etc. Recognizing these challenges,
Vietnam is actively enhancing its AI capabilities
through
strategic
initiatives
and
policy
developments:
•

Commitment and Vision: The government has
demonstrated a strong commitment to
integrating AI into its national development
strategy. This is exempliﬁed by the Prime
Minister’s Decision No. 127/QD-TTg, which
outlines a clear roadmap for AI research,
development, and application by 2030.
(luatvietnam)

•

Strategic Goals and Objectives: Vietnam
aims to position itself as a center for AI
innovation within the ASEAN region. To
achieve this, the government is fostering a
conducive environment for startups and
technology
companies,
encouraging
investment in AI solutions, and promoting the
establishment of innovation centers.

•

Integration into Public Administration: The
integration of AI into public administration is a
strategic goal of the government. By
leveraging AI technologies, the government
aims to enhance operational efficiency and
improve service delivery. For instance, the
introduction of AI-powered solutions, such as
a virtual tax assistant, reﬂects Vietnam's
commitment to using AI for better public
service outcomes. This initiative aligns with
the objectives outlined in the National Digital
Transformation Strategy, which seeks to
streamline processes and reduce waiting
times for citizens.

Vietnam currently lacks specialized laws
for AI development and application. These
include the Civil Code, the Law on
Consumer Protection, the Cybersecurity
Law, the Decree on Personal Data
Protection, and relevant administrative
and criminal regulations.
Dr. Nguyen Van Cuong, Director of the
Institute of Legal Science and Strategy
under Vietnam's Ministry of Justice
(Vietnamlawmagazine)

•

Investment in Human Resources and
Education: The government recognizes the
need for a skilled workforce to support AI
initiatives. The Ministry of Education and
Training has been tasked with implementing
programs to develop high-quality human
resources in AI and data science. This includes
incorporating
AI-related
subjects
into
educational curricula and promoting lifelong
learning opportunities.

•

Ethical Considerations and Responsible
Development: The government plans to
establish legal frameworks and guidelines to
ensure that AI technologies are developed
ethically, respecting human rights and privacy.

Vietnam is making signiﬁcant strides in AI
development, but challenges remain in legal
preparedness and ethics. The government's
commitment
to
a
comprehensive
policy
framework and an innovative environment is vital
for establishing Vietnam as an AI leader in
ASEAN. Projections from Google suggest that AI
could contribute up to $79.3 billion, or about 12%
of GDP, by 2030, highlighting its potential to drive
economic growth and competitiveness. This
underscores the urgency of addressing existing
challenges while showcasing the beneﬁts AI can
bring to Vietnam's economy. (Vietnamnet)

IT Market Overview

GLOBAL IT RECRUITMENT MARKET IN 2024-2025
The technology sector faces immediate challenges, certain trends indicate resilience and opportunities
for growth. Addressing the skills gap will be crucial for organizations looking to thrive in this ever
evolving landscape.
1. Recent global tech recruitment market
According to McKinsey Technology Trends Outlook
2024 (McKinsey, 2024), the global technology
sector has undergone signiﬁcant transformations,
notably marked by substantial layoffs in major
tech ﬁrms. Job postings associated with the
analyzed tech trends have dropped by 26%, which
is a much steeper decline than the overall 17%
decrease in global job postings. This reduction in
demand for talent within tech trends appears to
be primarily driven by cost-cutting measures
implemented by these companies in response to
declining revenue growth projections.

2. Recent global in-demand skills in
IT recruitment
•

From the insights of PwC Pulse Survey,
technology jobs in the future will necessitate a
blend of advanced skills and ﬂexible abilities
to adapt to a swiftly changing environment.

•

Proﬁciency in data analytics, data science,
and machine learning is essential as
organizations embrace data-driven strategies.
Additionally, strong cybersecurity knowledge,
including risk assessment and threat
detection, is crucial to protect assets.
Familiarity with cloud platforms like AWS,
Azure, and Google Cloud is also necessary due
to the shift towards cloud solutions.

•

In the evolving IT landscape, besides the
primary skill essential soft skills needed to
reinforce such as agility and adaptability are
essential for rapid change management.
Strong collaboration and communication skills
align technology strategies with business
objectives. Additionally, innovative problem
-solving is crucial for addressing emerging
challenges, while a commitment to continuous
learning ensures professionals keep pace with
rapid technological advancements.

2021 - 2023

Nonetheless, not all trends are facing negative
impacts. Sectors that continue to draw strong
investment and innovation, such as generative AI,
have not only maintained their job postings but
have also seen an increase. This indicates a robust
and persistent demand for advanced skills in these
areas. Furthermore, the electriﬁcation and
renewables sector has experienced positive job
growth, aided by public sector support for
infrastructure projects.
Despite the short-term variations in talent
demand, an examination of 4.3 million job postings
across 15 tech trends uncovers a signiﬁcant skills
gap. Alarmingly, fewer than half of potential
candidates possess the high-demand tech skills
needed for these positions, compared to the global
average. While many trends have recorded
year-on-year declines in job postings from 2022 to
2023, the total number of tech-related job postings
in 2023 still represents an 8% increase from 2021.
This trend indicates the potential for long-term
growth in the tech sector, highlighting the
necessity for strategic investment in skills
development to address future demands.

MULTI PROGRAMING LANGUAGES DEVELOPER
The evolving tech landscape necessitates that IT
professionals adapt by learning multiple
programming languages. According to this year’s
research from ITviec, on average, one developer
knows about 3 programming languages, the
outcome also highlights their positive attitudes if
they are required to learn a new/unfamiliar
language.
•

•

For a job offer that requires an unfamiliar
language, 55.5% of respondents indicated they
are "okay with it and will accept it," reﬂecting
a proactive approach to skill enhancement.
Those developers often hesitate to accept
job offers requiring unfamiliar programming
languages
for
several
reasons. The
signiﬁcant time, effort, and ﬁnancial
investment needed to learn a new language
can be overwhelming. They prioritize
language that aligns with their career
development goals, seeking opportunities that
enhance their skills. Additionally, the level of
company support and compensation is crucial;
adequate training and competitive pay can
encourage acceptance. Developers are also
concerned about the future relevance of the
skills they acquire, preferring to invest in
in-demand languages, and the presence of a
strong community around a technology can
further inﬂuence their decisions.

For the case required to learn a new
programming language in the current job,
the report indicates that 79.3% of developers
feel "completely ﬁne" with learning new
programming languages, reﬂecting a strong
willingness to adapt in their current roles. This
trend aligns with the increasing demand for
developers who can code ﬂexibly across
various languages, as highlighted by industry
reports from Stack Overﬂow and GitHub.

•

While this demonstrates a robust culture of
continuous learning within the tech industry,
some professionals express reluctance. Their
concerns include alignment with career goals,
the signiﬁcant time and resources required,
and the necessity of the skills. Additionally,
they seek company support and worry about
the future relevance of the languages being
learned.

•

In conclusion, the report shows that most IT
professionals are open to embracing new
programming languages, seeing them as
valuable opportunities for growth. This
adaptability is essential in a fast-paced
industry, where the ability to work with
multiple languages is increasingly valued.

IT MARKET REPORT

Company Strategy & Hiring Demand

The IT recruitment landscape in Vietnam has seen notable shifts in hiring demand and strategies. From 2019 to ﬁrst half of 2024 (1H
2024), moderate team growth (11–30%) peaked at 47.2% in 2023 but stabilized at 41.1% by mid-2024. ”We’re on ﬁre! (over 50%)” actual
growth increased from 2023 to 1H 2024 (15.3% to 18.7%), suggesting more companies achieved revenue or production alignment for
expansion. However, planned growth from 2020 to 1H 2025 shows declining moderate growth forecasts and dominating “No
growth/Reduction” plans (38.7% in 1H 2025), signaling a strategic shift toward sustainable hiring.
When reﬂecting on the past ﬁve years, the IT recruitment market has experienced signiﬁcant changes and events that have shaped
and redirected trends along the way. The Covid-19 pandemic (2019–2022) triggered a rapid surge in global digital adoption, driving
unprecedented IT sector growth. As the boom eased, the recruitment market began recalibrating to balance demand and supply.
Companies are now prioritizing cost optimization and addressing a slowdown in new projects.
A pivotal factor inﬂuencing these shifts is the rapid adoption of AI technologies, particularly generative AI since ChatGPT's debut in
November 2022. As companies automate routine tasks and implement AI-driven solutions, they are rethinking the skills required for
many tech roles. According to KPMG’s 2024 CEO Outlook, 58% of CEOs agree that generative AI has prompted them to reassess the
skills needed for entry-level positions. Furthermore, 92% of CEOs aim to increase their overall headcount while future-prooﬁng tech
talent and enhancing their employee value proposition to attract and retain top-tier professionals. (KPMG source)
This alignment of hiring demand shifting patterns, AI integration, and talent pivot highlights strategic changes, as
companies balance ambition with caution to ensure talent resilience, meet stakeholder expectations, and secure long-term
business sustainability.

Company Strategy & Hiring Demand

In 1H 2024, compared to the full year of 2023, a lower ratio of companies reported moderate growth (41.1% vs.
47.2%) and high growth (14% vs. 27.8%), while layoffs occurred at a slightly lower rate overall.
The conversion rate from applications to interviews decreased (13.9% vs. 20.5%), indicating a tighter screening
process or a higher volume of less-qualiﬁed IT applicants. However, the stability in the percentage of offers sent
and successful probation completions, both around 3%, suggests consistent hiring outcomes for qualiﬁed IT
candidates, even amid evolving recruitment challenges and a shifting talent market.

Overall Traits Of IT Professionals

Job site browsing frequency decreases as seniority increases. When there
is a need to job search, Freshers and juniors browse job sites the most
frequently (2.7 times per week), likely reﬂecting their active job-seeking
status. Middle-level IT professionals reduce this to 2.2 times, while senior
professionals and managers/leads drop further to 1.7 and 1.6 times,
respectively. C-level executives browse the least (0.9 time), likely due to
their established careers and lesser need for active searches.
Interestingly, experts/consultants browse slightly more (1.5 times),
perhaps reﬂecting project-based work or interest in niche opportunities.
This highlights a clear seniority-job search behavior trend.

Overall Traits Of IT Professionals

In the job research process, IT professionals prioritize information differently based on their career
levels. From juniors to manager/lead levels, the main focus is on employee reviews (average 70%) and
beneﬁts (average 57%). C-level professionals, however, concentrate on company history, product
portfolio, and domain expertise (52.5%). Experts and consultants place signiﬁcant emphasis on
beneﬁts and perks (67.7%) compared to other levels.
When it comes to perception, all levels agree that a high proportion of long-term employees (average
50%) deﬁnes a positive employer brand. Experts and consultants also value foreign ownership (54%).
Interestingly, positive employee reviews alone (average 25%) are not enough to establish a strong
employer brand. Companies that showcase tangible evidence of long-term employee retention and
performance growth are more likely to be perceived as positive employer brands.

IT Productivity & Engagement

UNDERSTANDING THE PRODUCTIVITY INDEX
The Productivity Index evaluates the effectiveness of IT professionals through self-assessment of key
performance indicators (KPIs). It is calculated by assigning weights to various factors based on their
importance, providing insights into productivity levels within a team or organization. Key components include:
•
•
•
•

Measurable Targets and KPIs: Assessment of how consistently professionals meet or exceed targets.
Timeliness: Evaluation of the ability to meet deadlines and complete assignments on time.
Quality of Work: Consideration of the frequency of rework required, indicating efficiency.
Ownership: Reﬂection on personal responsibility for tasks, fostering accountability.

By aggregating these self-evaluations, the Productivity Index offers a comprehensive view of an individual’s
productivity and helps identify areas for improvement
The index ranges from 0% to 100%, where higher percentages indicate greater productivity.

DISCLAIMER
The Productivity Index relies on based on the development of ITviec, which may be subjective and inﬂuenced
by business biases. Organizations should use this index alongside other performance evaluation methods for a
more holistic view of productivity.

Productivity index tends to be higher in major cities and among experienced employees or those who have
higher management level such as C-Level, expert/consultant, whereas junior staff and those in smaller regions
require additional support. For company types such as IT Outsourcing (72), IT Products (71), IT Services &
Consulting (71), the productivity index is slightly lower than that of non-IT businesses (75).

IT Productivity & Engagement

•

A well-structured work environment is crucial, with 46.0% of professionals emphasizing the need for
Well-deﬁned Tasks and Projects to clarify roles and boost accountability. The importance of Suitable
Conditions to Focus (30.7%) underscores the impact of workspace on concentration and productivity.

•

Effective communication and collaboration are vital for productivity in IT. A signiﬁcant number of IT
professionals prioritize Clear and Transparent Communication (37.4%) and Effective Coordination and
Knowledge Sharing (36.6%), which foster a cohesive team dynamic and promote smoother workﬂows and
innovation. Additionally, the creation of Collaborative and Quiet Spaces for Various Work Styles (29.5%)
enhances team synergy. Furthermore, 26.0% advocate for Flexible Work Arrangements for Work-Life
Balance, reﬂecting a growing recognition of the importance of balance for job satisfaction and retention.

•

The analysis reveals signiﬁcant gaps between the importance of various productivity factors and their
current application in organizations. Notably, many critical factors identiﬁed by IT professionals have seen
less than half of the companies reporting effective implementation. For instance, while 46.0% of
respondents emphasized the importance of well-deﬁned tasks and projects, only 21.0% indicated that their
organizations successfully applied this principle. This substantial gap suggests that many professionals lack
clarity in their roles, potentially leading to confusion and decreased productivity. Current company focus is
primarily on three areas: well-deﬁned tasks and projects (46% vs. 21%), clear communication from
management (37.4% vs. 18.3%), and effective coordination and knowledge sharing (36.6% vs. 18.8%).

•

Aspects such as reasonable deadlines (26.4% vs. 11.3%), access to modern tools (29% vs. 13.7%), and suitable
conditions for focus (30.7% vs. 13.9%) are highly valued yet least adopted. These ﬁndings underscore the
urgent need for company to reassess their practices and invest in the factors that matter most to their IT
workforce, ultimately fostering a more productive and satisﬁed team.

IT Productivity & Engagement

UNDERSTANDING THE ENGAGEMENT INDEX
The Engagement Index, developed by ITviec, measures how connected and committed IT professionals feel
towards their work and organization. This index is calculated based on self-reported evaluations of key factors,
with weights assigned according to their importance. Key criteria include:
•
•
•
•

Enjoyment of Work: Professionals assess their overall enjoyment of the tasks and responsibilities they
undertake, reﬂecting their passion and motivation
Pride in the Company: Employees evaluate their sense of pride in being part of the organization, which
enhances loyalty and morale.
Intention to Stay: This criterion indicates commitment and satisfaction with the workplace environment,
highlighting the desire to remain with the company long-term.
Recommendation of the Organization: Professionals reﬂect on whether they would recommend their
organization as a great place to work, emphasizing overall employee satisfaction and company culture.

By aggregating these self-assessments, the Engagement Index provides insights into employee morale and
helps organizations.
The index ranges from 0% to 100%, where higher percentages indicate greater engagement.

DISCLAIMER
The Productivity Index relies on based on the development of ITviec, which may be subjective and inﬂuenced
by business biases. It is recommended that organizations use this index in conjunction with other assessment
tools to gain a comprehensive understanding of employee engagement levels.

The Employee Engagement Index (EEI) highlights important variations across demographics, work
information, and company characteristics. Compared with the average EEI at 67, the EEI was signiﬁcantly high
at C-level (80), Expert/Consultant (85) & low at Da Nang city (57) and youngest age groups of IT employees
20-22 & 23-26 (23 and 62, respectively).

competitive salary (53.6%), annual salary increases (45.5%), 100% salary insurance (43.2%), and
project-based bonuses (56.6%). Furthermore, the demand for ﬁnancial security is reﬂected in company
