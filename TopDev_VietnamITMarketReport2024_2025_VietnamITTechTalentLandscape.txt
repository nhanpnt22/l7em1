The difficult business situation with an average of about 18.4
thousand businesses withdrawing from the market in the
first 6 months of the year is the main reason for the increase
in unemployment rate in the second quarter.
In the second quarter of 2024, production and business
activities of many industries and fields have improved but
are still facing difficulties. Enterprises are facing low and
unstable domestic and international market demand, input
material prices are higher than output goods prices,
difficulties in accessing capital, etc., which have affected the
unemployment situation of workers.

Companies face challenges in complying with updated
regulations and tax laws, including tax, anti-money laundering
and data privacy.
2. Shift towards profitability: As interest rates rise, investors
prioritize with a focus on profitability instead of growth.
Financial & human resource considerations will become a
higher priority for management.
3. Capability building for digital transformation: With the
digital transformation trend across sectors, there is a shortage
of specific skills in the market such as: PMO, Data Analytics,...
4. Data center growth: Cloud adoption, 5G rollout, and
tightening data privacy regulations create a significant growth
opportunity for data centers in Vietnam. This growth will require
effective data center deployment strategies.

IT & TECH TALENT LANDSCAPE

2024 - 2025 Vietnam IT Market Report

The World Bank in 2020 ranked Vietnam 70 among 190 economies in terms of
ease of doing business. However, TMF Group noted in their Global Business
Complexity Index that Vietnam’s ranking has improved due to reducing the effort
to start a business and do business filings. The bureaucracy that startups still
have to navigate can be daunting, and the recent corruption scandals in the real
estate and financial markets have made investors uneasy in committing
long-term to the market. This has led many Vietnamese startups to domicile in
neighboring Singapore not only for better legal transparency but also to get
funding from VCs.
On the global scale, English is the lingua franca of the business world. While
Vietnam has improved its ranking in English proficiency, the nation still ranks
58th out of 113 non-native English-speaking countries. This poses difficulties
for Vietnamese startups looking to expand regionally or globally. The lack of
English skills also limits non-Vietnamese from launching a startup in Vietnam
when compared to fellow SEA nations Malaysia and the Philippines, where English
is readily understood.
However, Vietnam is forecast to become an emerging Unicorn Country. Much
like China of two decades ago, the country is undergoing a massive
transformation. Trends from broadening digitization to a healthy talent supply to
a rising middle class ensure that Vietnam will have a robust startup ecosystem for
years to come.

VIETNAM: ABUNDANT AND POTENTIAL WORKFORCE BUT MANY BIG
CHALLENGES IN IMPROVING LABOR PRODUCTIVITY AND SKILL LEVELS
2026

In addition, with huge investment projects in chip manufacturing in Vietnam
from foreign corporations, training engineers to serve the semiconductor chip
manufacturing industry has become an important goal. Vietnam aims to train
25,000 engineers by 2025 and 100,000 engineers by 2030 for the
semiconductor chip research and manufacturing industry.

The highly skilled workers make up only 11.67%, almost unchanged from three years ago. Soft skills, including
foreign language skills, are increasingly important in most professions, even in technically inclined fields such as
manufacturing & information technology. However, according to the Vietnam Total Workforce Index 2022, the
proportion of Vietnamese workers who are proficient in English accounts for only 5% of the total
workforce. The rate is quite low compared to other non-English speaking countries in the region such as
Indonesia (10%), Malaysia (21%), and Thailand (27%). Vietnam's labor productivity growth in recent years has not
been fast enough to close the big gap with other countries in the region such as the Philippines, Indonesia,
Thailand, Malaysia, South Korea and Singapore.

TALENT FLYWHEEL
SKILLS-BASED HIRING AND
UPSKILLING

Employers are placing more emphasis on skills rather
than solely relying on traditional qualifications.
Skills-based hiring involves assessing candidates
based on their practical skills, demonstrated
experience, and ability to adapt to new technologies.
Companies are also investing in upskilling and reskilling
programs to develop the existing workforce and bridge
the skills gap.

AI-DRIVEN RECRUITMENT
TOOLS

AI-powered tools and platforms are increasingly being
used in the tech hiring process. These tools help
streamline candidate sourcing, resume screening, and
candidate assessment by leveraging machine learning
algorithms and natural language processing. AI-driven
recruitment tools aim to improve efficiency, reduce
bias, and identify the best-fit candidates.

DATA-DRIVEN DECISION
MAKING

Companies are leveraging data analytics and insights to
make informed hiring decisions. They are using data to
identify trends, optimize recruitment processes, and
evaluate the effectiveness of their hiring strategies.
Savvy hiring teams use data to drive their decisions. Having
measurable proof points helps when building a business
case for new technology, new processes or requesting
additional funding for much-needed projects. In 2023, with
businesses cutting down on unnecessary spending, every
decision will need to be backed by clear supporting data.

AUTOMATION OF
RECRUITMENT PROCESSES:

• Streamlined Job Posting & Distribution: Automated
platforms enable employers to create, customize, and
distribute job postings across multiple job boards and
social media channels, increasing visibility and
reaching a wider pool of candidates.
• Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS): ATS software
automates
candidate
tracking,
managing
applications, scheduling interviews, and storing
applicant data in a centralized database. This
streamlines
the
hiring
workflow,
improves
collaboration among hiring teams, and enhances data
management.
• Video Interviews & Assessments: Virtual interviews
and assessments allow employers to remotely
evaluate candidates’ skills, communication abilities,
and cultural fit. This saves time, reduces costs
associated
with
in-person
interviews,
and
accommodates remote candidates.

6.

GIG ECONOMY AND
FREELANCE WORK

The gig economy is gaining traction in the tech industry.
Companies are increasingly engaging freelancers or
independent contractors to fulfill short-term projects or
specialized tasks. This allows organizations to access
specific expertise and scale their workforce as needed.

TALENT MANAGEMENT LANDSCAPE
MULTI-GENERATIONAL
WORKFORCE
By 2025, Generation Z is expected to make
up 30% of the labor force in Vietnam.

As Vietnam’s population is aging and its
workforce is becoming more diverse, the issue
of
multi-generational workforce is more
important & challenging:
• To manage the expectations and needs of
employees from different generations: older
workers - expectations around job security
and stability,
younger workers prioritize
opportunities for career growth and
development
• To
manage
potential
conflicts
or
misunderstandings due to differences in
communication styles or work habits
• To address the issue of age discrimination in
the workplace

JOB LOYALTY

AI & AUTOMATION

Vietnam has seen rising employee
turnover rates, particularly in
sectors like technology,
manufacturing, and services, where
competition for skilled workers is
intense.

Applying AI and automation can
significantly improve efficiency,
decision-making, and the overall employee
experience.

•
The
high turnover rate among employees in Vietnam
•
also has broader societal implications that extend
•
beyond
the immediate impact on businesses:
• Increased Recruitment Costs: High turnover
• necessitates continual hiring and training, which
can be costly and time-consuming.
•
• Loss of Expertise: Frequent employee departures
can lead to a loss of institutional knowledge and
expertise, affecting overall productivity and
performance.
• Reduced Morale: Constant turnover can negatively
impact the morale of remaining employees,
potentially leading to a further decline in job
satisfaction and loyalty.

• 40% increase in employee productivity for
companies adopting AI across HR functions
(Accenture)
• Reduce the time spent on hiring by 30-50%,
allowing recruiters to focus on higher-value
tasks (Deloitte)
• 20-30% cost savings due to reduced manual
labor (McKinsey & Company)
• Employee Retention increases by 15-20%
(PwC)

SON DOONG EXPLANATION

VIETNAM
IT & TECH TALENT LANDSCAPE

2024 - 2025 Vietnam IT Market Report

The largest cave in the world
The parallels between these two ecosystems - the natural and the professional - highlight the need for a holistic, exploratory,
and forward-thinking approach to unlocking their full potential. The comparison helps illustrate the unique value and the
complex challenges inherent in both domains.
Unique and vast potential:

• Both the Son Doong Cave and Vietnam's tech talent pool represent remarkable, one-of-a-kind resources that are still largely unexplored and whose
full potential remains to be uncovered. Just as the sheer scale and untapped wonders of the cave captivate explorers, the depth and diversity of
tech skills in Vietnam hold immense yet enigmatic promise.

Mysterious and complex:

• The inner workings of the Son Doong Cave ecosystem, with its own microclimate and hidden interconnections, mirror the nuanced and often
opaque nature of Vietnam's tech talent landscape. Both represent environments that are not easily understood or quantified from the outside.

Sustainability challenges:

• Just as the long-term viability of Son Doong's delicate ecosystem
is uncertain, Vietnam faces the challenge of cultivating and retaining its tech
https://topdev.vn
talent in the face of global competition for skilled professionals. Addressing these sustainability concerns is crucial for both.

Future-shaping potential:

• Breakthrough discoveries within the Son Doong Cave have the power to transform our scientific understanding of the world. Similarly, Vietnam's
ability to harness and develop its tech talent could have far-reaching implications for the country's economic and technological future.
