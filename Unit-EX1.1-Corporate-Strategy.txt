                     • The strategy is a method selected to provide an
                       anticipated future like the achievement of a goal or
                       resolution to an issue, and it helps to utilise their
                       resources for their most effective and efficient use
                       (Mazzei and Noble 2017).
    1.1 Critically   • Business strategy is the companies working plan for
                       attaining its vision, competing progressively,
analyse strategic      optimising financial performance, prioritising
                       objectives with its business model

   theories and      • The strategy describes in practical terms how the
                       company discriminates itself from competitors,
                       where it earns margins and how it earns revenues
         models      • The organisation utilises strategy models to
                       advance operations and achieve their
                     • objectives
                     • The development of strategy theories and models
                       needs recognising the key goals of an organisation,
                       detecting the key components of the process
                       leading from an initial point to the accomplishment
                       of those goals and building ways of incrementing the
                       process for ideal output and the attainment of the
                       stated goals (Bergeron et al., 2017).
• There are various strategic theories and models which are utilised to describe how a project or
  initiative encourages the key goal and objectives of the organisation. Some of them are given below
• Blue ocean strategy model: Blue Ocean Strategy is a strategic planning model that appeared in a book
  named “Blue Ocean Strategy: How to create uncontested market space and make competition
  irrelevant” in 2005 (Bourletidis 2014).
• Blue ocean strategy is the instantaneous detection of differentiation and low cost to initiate a
• new market space and create new demand.
• This model is all about creating and apprehending unconcealed market space, thus making the
  competition irrelevant (Wee 2017).
• Blue ocean strategy model is depended on the view that market limitations and company structure
  are not a given and can be reassembled by the actions and beliefs of company workers
• In blue oceans strategy model, competition is inappropriate because the rules of the game are
  waiting to be fixed.
❑ In this model, the blue ocean is an analogy to describe the deeper and wider potential to be
    established in unexplored market space, and it is deep, powerful and vast in terms of
    effective development.

                                 Sources: Bourletidis (2014)
❑ Porter’s Five Forces: Michael Porter offered a framework that models a company or an
   industry as being inclined by five forces is called Porter’s Five Forces strategy model.

❑ The strategic business managing pursuing to advance an edge over an opponent company
   can utilise this model to comprehend better the company background in which the
   organisation operates (Indiatsy et al., 2014).

                                Sources: Indiatsy et al. (2014)
❑ VRIO Framework: The VRIO Framework is an abbreviation for “value, rarity, imitability,
    organisation.” This framework connects more to the vision statement than the whole
    strategy (Indartono and Wibowo 2017)

❑ The definitive objective in executing the VRIO model is that it will effect in a competitive
    benefit in the marketplace
❑ The VRIO framework is a strategic analysis tool structured to aid organisations protect and
    uncover the resources and abilities that provide them a long-term competitive benefits

                 • The popular strategy that is becoming more important in a globalised
                   marketplace is ‘Think globally’ ‘act globally’ and there are no
                   limitations when it comes to the movement of products and global
                   marketing services.
1.2 Assess and   • Recently, it has become apparent that companies cannot separate
determine how      itself from global marketing competition by enduring in the
                   domestic product or a less choose markets (Kemper et al., 2015).
successful       • Global marketing strategies need considerable investment in
                  Click to addmanpower
                   resources,   text       and money to comprehend different markets,
different          local tradition, manners, etiquette, the country and manners (Canel
                   et al., 2015). Here are some various successful strategies applied in
strategies are     the global marketplace to follow
                 • Understand the cultural differences: For branding across various
when applied       countries, we have to do some global marketing research on what
                   the single word or words mean in that country. For example, Colgate
in the global      toothpaste brand couldn’t work out successively in France because it
                   was the name of a popular pornographic magazine of France
marketplace
• An inappropriate brand name in a special linguistic environment or cultural can cause high destruction to
  the company, and its marketing exertions may go down the drain (Petersen et al., 2015)
• One size doesn’ t fit all, add local flavour: Customer tastes will vary day to day from country to country,
  and it mainly depends on climatic zones, customs and tradition of the customers. For example, Asia
  Domino’s Pizza has successfully utilised local flavouring like seafood for its topping with success.
• Production, marketing, logistics: Progress in technology, better logistics and economies of scale help the
  companies to have multi-locational operations to provide a product (Hsu et al., 2016). It helps the main
  company to design a product in their major branch or an emerging market, get them invented in a various
  country, do the manufacturing there and export it to other nations.
• Plan the global campaign: Whole products are undergone global marketing agency when it arrive in the
  global campaign and Once a product is launched the global campaign has to begin. It has to be undertaken
  by global marketing, and they have to take care of the media planning, hoardings creative and other mass
  publicity campaigns in connection with the marketing team in the global marketing company
• Pricing & Packaging: Prices are a very significant element in developing markets while it may not be so
  in developed markets (Banerjee 2017). For example, the daily usage materials like toothpaste, oils,
  shampoos etc. are available in small packets with less cost like bottles of bottles of 250 or 500 ml to 50
  or 100 ml packs to cater to lesser income segments or those living in rural areas
• Use the power of social media: Social media is the most effective successful strategy to apply in the
  global marketplace. Social networks connect the whole sales network and suitable medium while for
  sharing industry global marketing news, especially those including B2B products (Dijkmans et al.,
  2015)
• Global scale marketing can not only be undertaken by large companies, and small and medium
  companies have an essential role in it. By localising web content into the language of the region help
  the local people and small company to expand their marketplace globally
    1.3 Evaluate how     • Corporate strategy is the cooperation's overall
                           direction and scope and the way in which its
        individual and     different business strategies work together to
                           accomplish particular goals (Campbell 2017)
organisational ethics,   • Corporate strategy explains how companies build
                           value across various business and regulate the
   also global ethical     scope of the activities of the company and the
                           manner in which a company's business processes
    issues can impact      encourages company objectives.
                         • In corporate strategy, ethical behaviour intends to
  corporate strategy.      be good for business and includes demonstrating
                           respect for primary moral principles that consists
                           fairness, honesty, individual rights, dignity,
                           diversity and equality (Wu et al., 2015)
                         • An ethics strategy is necessary to generate an
                           ethical business. Most organisations share the
                           goal of ethical culture is often made more
                           problematic because the management of ethics is
                           not prioritised
• Individual ethics positively influence the experience of other when utilised to administer an individual
  ‘s social connected behaviour and it does not provide any negative impact on others (Applin 2017).
• In corporate strategy, the individual ethics are the basic values and principles that regulate
• communication between individuals
• Organizational ethics are the standards and principles which business function based on the reference
  for business, and they are the best established through acts of fairness, integrity, responsibility, honour
  and compassion (Sekerka et al., 2014)
• In corporate strategy, organisational ethics describe the code of conduct at the workplace and also
  with the customers and associates
• Some essential ethical principles to be followed for a successful corporate strategy are follow
  environmental, safety and healthy standards, indulge in reliable and truthful advertising, protect the
  basic right of the workers, continually develop the products, product facilities and operations to
  enhance the resource consumption and so on
• Ethical issues are problem or situation that needs an organisation or a person to
  select between replacements that must be examined as wrong or right (Chonko and Hunt
  2018)
• Ethical issues in strategically achieved organisations surface when managers make
  decisions
• to progress goals that have negative significances.
• An organisation must describe a code of ethics to manage all of its workers accountable
  for their decisions involving leaving them from utilising their business connections,
  equipment's knowledge and other resources fitting to the company for personal
  financial progress (Harriss and Atkinson 2015)
• In a corporate strategy, a company must consider the ethics of services it pays for outside
  and inside of the country to establish its social responsibility
• Corporate strategy is positively and negatively influenced by individual and
  organisational
• ethics also global ethical issues.

 Strategy
                • This section begins with a critical analysis of the supply chain
                  methods, models, and
2.1 –           • theories.

Critically     • Methods of Supply Chain:
                • With respect to the supply chain management methods, these are
                  primarily with keeping in view the processes and tools to manage
analyse           those, especially in the light of modernity (Jacobs et al., 2014).

supply chain    • These methods or techniques have been formed to manage the
                  various risks associated with

methods,        • the supply chain.
                • This being said, production, supply, inventory, location,

models, and       transportation, and information can be considered as the methods
                  of supply chain management.
                • Production clearly implies the raw materials being transformed
theories          into the
                  end
                  product for customer usage (Nahmias and Cheng, 2009).
• Supply denotes the stock that is available for use (Hugos, 2018).
• Inventory is regarded as one of the salient features of the supply chain management, where
• its primary function is to increase profitability (Christopher, 2016).
• Inventory management a department that mainly deals with stock and noncapitalised assets, supervises the flow
  of goods from manufacturers to the warehouses, where it reaches the point of sale (Michalski, 2009).
• Location is determined by evaluating the existing distribution network system.
• It decides upon the allocation of customer demands to the selected service facilities (Melo et al., 2009).
• Transportation comprises of transporting both the inputs required for the production and the finished products
  themselves to the areas of distribution (Eyefreight, 2018).
• Information like any other component or method in the supply chain management is a vital entity .
• It is only through effective communication in and across the supply chain that a smooth and
• systematic in-flow and outflow of the inputs and outputs can be ensured .
• Supply Chain Theories:
 • Supply chain theories are built upon the fact that the
   supply of products undergo the transformation of inputs
   or raw materials into what can be called as the output or
   final product (Pagell and Wu, 2009) .
 • The theories involve the prime objectives of integrating
   and managing the sources , flow, and control of products.
 • It involves a total systems perspective that spans across
   the multiple functions and tiers of the suppliers.
• Supply Chain Model:
 • Lastly, with regard to the model of supply chain
   management, nothing can better explain SCM than the
   SCOR model.
 • This model is a kind of management tool that is aimed at
   addressing, communicating, and improving the decision-
   making processes of the SCM and includes the company it
   is working for, the suppliers, and the customers of that
   particular company (Li et al., 2011).
• Furthermore, the SCOR, an acronym of supply
  chain operations reference, is a model
  developed by the Supply Chain Council.
• This model is being endorsed as a cross-
  industry and is a standard diagnostic tool for
  supply chain management (Wang et al., 2010) .
• The SCOR model is built on the five basic
  elements of plan, make, deliver and return,
  where the processes flow from the
  procurement of raw materials to the end
  product, finally to the point of delivery.
• The return element is common to both the
  supplier and the customer as can be seen from
  the picture.
SCOR Model

• Nevertheless, when speaking about the models for supply chain management, these can be
  categorised into two, namely descriptive modeling and prescriptive modeling.
• Descriptive modeling utilises data mining, activity-based costing, performance metrics, simulation,
  and system dynamics (Arlbjørn et al., 2011) .
• Prescriptive modeling lays stress on optimisation, which involves mathematical programming
• in combination with heuristic methods (Mahmoodzadeh et al., 2009).
• Hence, the SCOR model would undoubtedly come under the descriptive modeling.
                   • In assessing the role of global supply chains in organisations, they
                     can be defined as a network that extends worldwide.
                   • These are dynamic in their functions as they deal with the
2.2 - Critically     overall global delivery of the manufactured products.
                   • They are exemplary as to the concept of the supply chain and are

role of global     • Without supply chain, it would be impossible for a business entity to
                     operate.
supply chains      • To control the supply of goods and raw materials, supply chain
                     management have been formed.
in                 • Supply chain management manages goods and services flow and
                     deals with the processes of converting raw materials into usable

organisations.       products.
                   • These products are tagged with value-added services, keeping the
                     customers in prime view
                   • (Koopman et al., 2010).
• Overall, it can be assumed that supply chain assists in the growth of a business, starting from the
  procurement of materials to the finished products and distributing these to the customers.
• All these processes occur in a systematic way, actively streamlined with the help of sophisticated
  machineries and advanced technology (Ptak and Schragenheim, 2016) .
• Supply chain management in general comes with three main goals, namely to increase the speed of
  transactions, to reduce inventory, and to increase revenue by fulfilling and satisfying the demands of
  customers in an efficient manner (Richards, 2017).
• People, information, processes, and resources are mainly involved in the supply chain management.
• For the smooth functioning of supply chain, be it local or overseas, it is imperative that it is loaded
  with all possible amenities that can make it dependable and trustworthy.
• Above all, as viewed by Gereffi and Frederick (2010), the global procurement of products by various
  industries and firms reveals the overall potential of these global supply chains, where capitalisation
  of the world’s best suppliers follow suit.
                         • As per the reports of Prasad (2018), the real competitive
                           advantage in the global supply chains can be gained when as

                         • These factors are observed to be the hindrances for the
                           potentially effective supply chain management practices.
• Environmental factors have as well being found to affect global supply chain (Wong et al.,
• 2011).
• Firms operating as supply chains have to abide to the strict rules and regulations posed by national
  and international laws on exports and imports (Vogel, 2010) .
• As a result, industries and organisations are forced to resort to limited productivity that instead of
  harnessing their reputation, will actually prove to be harmful.
• Raising productivity costs, manufacturing costs etc in such cases for the purpose of survival will
  negatively impact the function and growth of these global supply chains unless and until they lower
  the costs, which will indeed prove worthwhile enough to restore their functionality, sustainability,
  and longevity.
• On the political side, if certain unwanted restrictions are relaxed like in the immediate procurement
  of the most wanted materials like medicines and all, which may not be available in some countries
  can definitely prove helpful.
• Likewise, the other basic necessities , which are not available in certain countries, but which are as
  well needed can also be spared free of the huge taxes that are levied on them.

                                           Strategy
     3.1 Evaluate how corporate strategy can be applied in
                 a range of organisation functions.

• Corporate strategy posses a vital role in the survival of an organisation in the future.
• However, developing a corporate strategy will not be enough for the organisations to attain the desired objectives and goals.
• A valid corporate strategy helps in meeting the business objectives, profit, growth and competitive for a firm (Micheli and
Manzoni, 2010).
•   An inappropriate strategy will produce a negative outcome and failure of the business.
•   Hence, it is significant to evaluate the efficiency and applicability of the formulated strategies.
•   The formulated corporate strategy can be applied using different approaches.
•   According to Chang (2016), there are three major approaches available for implementing the corporate strategy.
•   The approaches can be categorised into a strategic planning approach, financial control approach and strategic control approach.

• Strategic planning approach
• Under the strategic planning approach, the management of the firm acts as a master planner.
• The corporate strategy implementation in all departments and functions of the organisation will be conducted through a
centralised approach (Teigão dos Santos and Partidário, 2011).
• The management will have detailed control over the departments while implementing the strategy.
• Thus, it can be noted as a prescribed and top to bottom approach in the strategic
• implementation.
• The primary advantage of this approach is that it helps the organisation in building up the coordination between the
departments and the functions during the corporate strategy implementation (Perreault et al. , 2015)
• However, the centre need not be aware of the potential risks underlying in the implementation of the strategy in the
various departments due to lack of consideration.
• It can be observed as a major limitation of this approach.

• Financial control approach
• Under the financial control approach, the centre will be concentrated in setting up the
• financial targets.
• The corporate strategy implementation under this approach will be in the bottom to top pattern.
• The centre or the management’s responsibility in strategy implementation will be limited to the control of the
investments (David, 2011).
• Thus, it can be stated that the management fulfils the duty of a banker or shareholder.
 • The departments will enjoy freedom in implementing the strategy as the centre will only be interested in the controlling the
   financial aids.
 • The primary advantage of this approach is that it increases the responsiveness of the departments in implementing the
   corporate strategy across the various functions of the organisation.
 • However, under the financial control approach, the management or the centre will lose the chances to direct or control the
   actions of the departments in the strategic implementation.

• Strategic control approach
 • Under the strategic control approach, the major role of the management or centre will be of a strategic shaper.
 • The centre will provide freedom to the departments for implementing the corporate strategy.
 • The approach can be identified as following a Bottom to top pattern.
 • The centre will be concentrated in setting up both the financial and strategic targets.
 • According to De Wit and Meyer (2010), the strategic control approach helps the centre or the management in motivating the
   departments.
 • In addition, the approach will enhance the coordination between the centre and the departments of an organisation.
 • However, the chances of profound bargaining and cultural changes are the major limitations
 • of this strategic implementation approach (Hill et al. 2014).
3.2 Critically assess how corporate strategy can be successfully
                        integrated into organisations.

 • Integrating the corporate strategy into the organisation is a complex task.
 • The management of an organisation has to consider the nature of the business while integrating the strategy.
 • According to Ireland et al. (2009), the integration of the corporate strategy into the organisations can be well
   observed with the help of the Bartlett and Ghoshal model.
 • Bartlett and Ghoshal model is the framework used by the organisations for managing the international
   strategy and operations.
 • According to the Barlett and Ghoshal model, the international strategy of an organisation
 • focuses on the two areas, the global integration and the local responsiveness.
 • Hence, the framework portrays the two major pressures in integrating the strategy like the pressure for local
   responsiveness and pressure for global integration.
 • Bartlett and Ghoshal Matrix contains four matrix such as the global, transnational, international and
   multi-domestic (Saka-Helmhout, 2011).
• Global
 • Under the global approach, an organisation aims at integrating its corporate strategy at the global level.
 • The global approach is identified to be having the low responsiveness and high integration.
 • Under the global approach, the company aims in implementing the corporate strategy and decisions of the
   parent company across the nations (Burton et al. ,2015).
 • Hence, the approach intends to provide standardised product and service across the global level.
Figure 1: Bartlett and Ghoshal Matrix
   Source: Saka-Helmhout (2011)
 • Pharmaceutical companies are a great example for those who implement the corporate strategy at a
   global level.

• Transnational
 • The transnational approach possesses the features of both the domestic and global strategy.
 • The transnational approach is well known for its high responsiveness and high integration.
 • The primary aim of the organisations who integrate the corporate strategy through the transnational
   approach is to gain the benefits of the global integration as well as to maximise the local responsiveness.
 • The organisations following the transnational approach will have subsidiaries and integrated network
   across the nations.
 • The subsidiaries will enable the organisation in gaining potential knowledge about the local
 • market.
 • Hence, the strategy integration will be in accordance with the needs of the market.
 • The Unilever company is a good example of following the transnational approach in the strategy
   integration.
• International
 • The international approach in the strategy integrationrestricts the communication of the
 • subsidiaries.
 • Under the international approach, the organisations portray low responsiveness and low integration.
 • The strategy implementation or the integration will be performed by the organisation from its parent country
    (Rugman et al. 2011).
 • In addition, the company decides the strategy for each of its subsidiaries.
 • However, the strategies implemented for each of the subsidiaries will be different.
 • Hence, the subsidiaries of an organisationfunction as local channels for selling the products of the company.

• Multi-domestic
 • The multi-domestic approach in the strategic integration shows the high local responsiveness and low integration.
 • Under the multi-domestic approach, the strategy of an organisationwill be intended to meet the demands of the local
   market (Rugman et al. 2011).
 • The organisationfollowing the multi-domestic approach will not have a standardised strategy or products.
• The companies following the multi-domestic
  approach will have a decentralised model of
  operations across the nations.
• The subsidiaries of the companies following the
  multi-domestic approach                will      be
• independent and autonomous.
• Hence, the global strategy in the multi-domestic
  approach will be missing (Rothaermel, 2015).
• Nestlé company is a good example for following
  the multi-domestic approach in corporate
• strategy integration.
3.3 Discuss how different organisation functions can affect the
         success of corporate strategy across the organisation.
      ❑ The functions of an organisation can significantly impact on the corporate strategy of the firm.
      ❑According to Wheelen and Hunger (2011), the functions of a firm should cope up with the
      corporate strategy of the organisation.
      ❑ The success of the corporative strategy depends upon the ability of the organisation in fulfilling
      the objectives.
      ❑The congruence model can be utilised for understanding the success of the corporate strategy of
      an organisation.
      ❑The congruence model discusses that the performance of an organisation is depended on four
      elements such as the people, task, structure and culture (Lin, 2014).




                                           Figure 2: congruence model
                                                Source: Lin (2014)
• Hence, it is important to maintain the effectiveness of the elements in order
   to make the
• formulated corporate strategy successful.
• The tasks carried out in the organisation should be able to meet the desired
objectives and thereby to achieve the strategy of the organisation.
• The tasks should be creative and able to achieve the competitive advantage in the
   market.
• In addition, the tasks should be carried out by following the proper approaches.
• The people or the workforce of the organisation should be suitable for
   accomplishing the
• preferred tasks.
• The workforce should possess significant skills, education, knowledge and
experience in accomplishing the tasks.
• The organisation should provide appropriate rewards and appreciation to the
  employees for
• motivating and enhancing their performance.
• The organisational structure of the company should be in accordance with the
formulated strategy.
• According to Teece (2010), a company seeking to meet the demands of the
local market will have to choose the multi-domestic approach rather than the
global.
• The organisational arrangement should be in line to meet the demands of
  the tasks.
• Cosh et al. (2012) noted the failure of organisational structure in
meeting the required arrangements would result in the failure of the
corporate strategy of the company.
• The company culture is the final element which influences both the
  functions of the organisation
• and the corporate strategy.
• Failure in providing positive work culture will negatively impact on the
functions of the workforce and the success of the corporate strategy.
• Moreover, the organisation should be able to promote the company
  culture among the
• employees or the workforce.
• The lack of knowledge of the company culture can further negatively
impact on the success of the corporate strategy.

• LO4: Demonstrate a range of professional skills including critical thinking, negotiation
skills, leadership and team work, and communication skills
4.1 Evaluate personal skills against the skill set needed to
             operate effectively in a global organisation at
             strategic level
• According to Aaker and McLoughlin (2010), personal development is a lifelong process where the skills and
  talents of the individual are aligned to achieve aims and goals of the organisation by maximising their potential.
• The Maslow’s Hierarchy of Needs stressed on self-actualisation process which is essential for
• an individual to develop the full potential for performing any activities.
• As per the observation of Berry (2011) developing a personal vision is identified as the crucial part of the self-
  development.
• Personal development is significant for professionals and leaders mainly for decreasing the task failures and
  reducing unsuccessful activities which creates adverse effects on the organisation.
• Individuals should be able to become competent and autonomous for surviving in the
• corporate field according to Maslow’s Hierarchy of Needs (Jerome, 2013).
• The professionals and leaders in the corporate field require the following skills to augment
• their competitiveness in the corporate sphere.
• As per Dada and Jagboro (2015) the competitive skills required for a professional are time management, self-
  confidence, work-life balance, communication skill, problem-solving skills, active listening, confidence, organising
  and emotional intelligence.
• According to De Villiers (2010), listening skills are significant for understanding the issues and to respond
  appropriately and likewise, listening skills are important for professionals to manage workers and to build a healthy
  workplace is essential.
• According to Dada and Jagboro (2015), professionals need to record every activity starting from the initial phase of
  the self-improvement process. The personal development plan needs to be reviewed and revised.
• As per Martocchio (2011), the problem-solving ability of professionals help to choose the best alternative from the
  best possible decision.
• Moreover, leaders should be able to organise task, time and materials for improving the performance of the
  organisation.
• Likewise, self-promotion and self-development are the imperative factors which strengthen
• the career of workers in the organisation, mentions Albrecht et al. (2015).
• Dada and Jagboro (2015) pointed out that, motivation is an important factor to overcome the problems such as fear
  and other weakness and for developing the personal skills.
• Macey et al. (2011) mentioned that professionals need to work on their negative habits such as hyper temper, lack of
  confidence etc and moreover the professionals should concentrate on building good habits.
• The leaders should be able to deal with tough situations and peoples. The clients and other stakeholders may be tough
  and inconvincible which creates a difficult situation for the professionals to deal with them.
• Therefore, trying new methods and ways to develop confidence to solve issues and to improve self-development is
  highly necessary (Macey et al., 2011).
4.2 Understand and make use of theory, relevant
     techniques and practices that enables learners to
     develop their individual skill set.

• According to Zepeda (2013), the action plan is significant for developing the personal skills
  and talents. The action plan is identified as lists of steps which an individual should be
  taken in order to achieve a specific goal.
• Moreover, in an action plan, a quick review is conducted on the required resources and
  achievability of goals.
• According to Moser (2012), the action plan is both formal and informal. In the case of
  professional development, structured action plan development is imperative.
• The pivotal seven steps of the action plan are the problem defining, data collection,
  priorities and clarify the issue, formulating the goal, implementing the action plan, review
  and monitor the outcome.
• As per Bergsteiner et al. (2010), Kolb Learning Cycle is also called Experiential Learning because the
  experience gained by the employee is considered to be the learning and developing the method.
• The model comprises of mainly four steps, and they are concrete experience, reflective
• observation, abstract conceptualisation and active experimentation.
• According to Bergsteiner et al. (2010) concrete experience is identified as the process of learning from
  other peoples and experiences and moreover, learners are sensitive to others feelings. Likewise,
  reflective observation includes viewing a problem from the different perspective and observing keenly
  before judging.
• The abstract conceptualisation is explained as the intellectual understanding of the scenario
• and logical thinking.
• Active experimentation in the learning process is noted as influencing other people or events through
  action. Risk-taking nature of an individual is included in the dynamic experimentation process
  (Bergsteiner et al., 2010).
• Myers-Briggs Type Indicator: Brings a clear vision of the personality. According to Myers-
• Briggs Type Indicator, every personality has its own significance.
• The Meyers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) is a self-assessment test which helps individuals to gain insights on learning
  methods. It is a framework for relationship-building, developing positivism, and achieving excellence.
• The outcome of the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator concentrates on learner’s self-awareness on their performance and
  skills (Lloyd, 2012).
• Mainly eight types of personalities are described through the theory.
• The four pairs of personality styles are extraversion and introversion, sensing and intuition, thinking and feeling and
  the last judgment and perception (Lloyd, 2012).
• Extraversion in the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator is defined as styles concerned with the directions given by
  professionals, and moreover directions are given to deal with the people and outer world.
• According to Lloyd (2012), the third pair of personality types in the Myers-Briggs Type
• Indicator reflects the decision-making style.
4.3 Provide personal examples where a range of professional
                     skills where demonstrated


❑ Communication skills are imperative for gaining attention from the customers and
 • stakeholders. The communication with the team members is another imperative arena which requires the
   good communication skill of the professional (Zepeda, 2013).
❑ In the workplace, critical thinking is significant where professionals understand and interpret issues to deliver
   a better conclusion.
❑ As per the observation of Moon (2013), decision-making is another area which should be improved by
   the professionals to make a quick judgment on issues.
❑ Professionals require the ability to lead the team members. Therefore the leadership skills should be
   developed by the individuals.
❑ In the learning phase, mainly two types of skills are considered for improvement, and they are
   technical/professional skills or employability skills.
• The technical skills are developed in an individual through the learning phase while the
  employability skills are mentioned as the skills achieved through the work experience
  (Zepeda, 2013).
• According to Moon (2013), transferable skills are the specific set of skills that are developed
  and used throughout life in work and non-work situations.
• Teamwork, time management, communication and leadership are categorised under the
• transferable skills.
4.4 Communicate effectively with fellow professionals and
competently
present ideas and proposals
• According to Gregory and Willis (2013), workplace communication improves productivity
  and transparency of an organisation. Excellent communication is essential for maintaining
  a strong working relationship with other members in the organisation.
• Communication skills help the individual to succeed while applying for jobs and
  communication skills are considered as the imperative factor for selecting the candidates.
• Poor communication results in communication gaps in the organisation and moreover
  effective presentation of ideas and proposals becomes tough if the communication is not
  strong (Gregory and Willis, 2013).
• According to Ruck and Welch (2013), a poor presentation is a serious issue which
  destroys the professional career.
• According to Binder (2016), an individual can develop the communication skills by defining goals and expectations, clear
  messages, selecting a communication medium, involving the employees and enhancing the listening skills.
• Communication is identified as a two-way process, and moreover, the communication gap in the workplace should be
  eliminated.
• A clear idea on goals and expectations should be formulated including the requirements for doing the tasks (Gillespie et al.,
  2010).
• The professionals require communication skills for keeping all the team members on track
• thereby implementing the strategies much more effectively.
• Moreover, effective leadership requires excellent communication skills.
• Effective communication mitigates issues regarding sudden change in management (Gillespie et al., 2010).
