1. Introduction
Facilitating access to safe, clean, and adequate sanitation facilities is crucial in
promoting human health and overall well-being for development, but it is still lagging
behind schedule (Daudey, 2018; Mara and Evans, 2018). The lack of sanitation
facilities is a significant global challenge affecting 3.6 billion individuals, while 1.7
billion people do not have access to basic sanitation services (The World Bank, 2023).
This deficiency results in various problems, including malnutrition, stunted growth,
and illnesses caused by water-borne and vector-borne diseases, which have been
estimated to cause 2.9 million cases of diseases and 95,000 deaths each year (Mara,
2017; Sarkar and Bharat, 2021; World Health Organization, 2022). Sanitation is far
more than a matter of convenience or development; it is a fundamental human right
recognized globally (Guedes et al., 2024). Its significance for humanity extends well
beyond basic hygiene, serving as a cornerstone of public health, social equality, and
sustainable development. The current sanitation challenges necessitate the
development of advanced technologies and infrastructure. The shortcomings of
conventional sanitation systems, including inefficiencies in management, monitoring,
labor intensity, and absence of data.

By integrating the Internet of Things (IoT) and advanced Artificial Intelligence
(AI) techniques, the shortcomings can be addressed. IoT brings forth a multitude of
benefits across various sectors (Liao et al., 2018; Lin et al., 2017). IoT devices can
monitor and control machinery, processes, and systems in real-time. This leads to
improved efficiency, reduced downtime, and increased productivity. Sensors can
collect data on equipment performance, temperature, humidity, energy consumption,
and more. The massive amount of data generated by IoT devices can be analyzed to
gain valuable insights into operations, consumer behavior, and market trends. This
data-driven approach supports better decision-making and innovation. The synergy
between AI’s cognitive capabilities and IoT’s expansive data network lays the
foundation for intelligent systems (Adi et al., 2020; Bharadwaj et al., 2021; Cui et al.,
2018). By analyzing the continuous stream of data from IoT-connected sensors and
devices, AI algorithms can swiftly identify anomalies and accurately predict
equipment failures. Through AI, machines learn from historical IoT data, enabling
them to evolve their actions and responses based on past outcomes. This results in
more intelligent and context-aware automation.
Advanced sanitation systems are equipped with instrumentation,
interconnectivity, and intelligence to enable comprehensive monitoring, analysis of
status, forecasting of changes, and optimization of troubleshooting. These modern
data-driven systems enable real-time data collection and decision making, resulting in
improved sanitation facility availability, accessibility, acceptability, and
accountability (Ahmed et al., 2017; Kassab et al., 2020; Ray, 2018). Several case
studies demonstrate the tangible impact of intelligent sanitation systems in various
communities. In Kenya, the implementation of eSOS smart toilets equipped with
sensors and data analytics has resulted in hygienic, safe, and affordable sanitation
facilities. These smart toilets not only provide improved sanitation services but also
collect valuable data to support their operation and facilitate efficient waste
management. The eSOS system maximizes the use of smart technologies for faecal
and septic sludge treatment, enabling comprehensive monitoring, effective operation,
and timely maintenance (Aqua for All, 2024). In Pune, India, a pioneering smart toilet
project was implemented by MIT’s Civic Data Design Lab in collaboration with the
Indian NGO Shelter Associates. The project involved installing sensors in community
toilets across the city’s slums to collect data on usage frequency, water consumption,
and maintenance needs. Initially deployed in 12 community toilets with plans to
expand to over 100, the smart toilet system improves the availability and cleanliness
of public sanitation facilities, provides urban planners with data-driven insights, and
enhances resource allocation efficiency, such as optimizing cleaning staff schedules
(Coalition, 2018). Xiaomi’s smart toilet for home use demonstrates the potential of
IoT in personal sanitation. The toilet seat includes sensors that monitor various health
metrics, including urine flow rate, body temperature, and stool consistency. Data is
sent to a smartphone app, allowing users to track their health over time (Xiaomi
Community, 2024; Yang et al., 2021). These examples underscore the potential of
intelligent sanitation to address critical challenges in both developing and developed
urban contexts, demonstrating improvements in resource efficiency, public health, and
quality of life.

Intelligent sanitation systems can leverage the valuable data generated by
sanitation facilities to optimize performance, anticipate system failure, detect potential
health risks, support decision-making, and inform sanitation improvements. However,
the conventional sanitation industry is unable to fully leverage IoT and its associated
data. Intelligent sanitation is still in its early stages, with limited research, sluggish
advancement, and fragmented contributions.
To consolidate the fragmented research work, this paper undertakes a thorough
review of intelligent sanitation papers from both academic and industrial perspectives.
The review explores the historical development, system detection, health monitoring,
AI integration, opportunities, and challenges of intelligent sanitation. Existing
research studies are examined in detail, knowledge gaps are identified, and the
potential of intelligent sanitation is discussed alongside its limitations. Furthermore,
this paper examines the state-of-the-art architecture, applications, and services of
intelligent sanitation solutions to assess the opportunities and challenges. This paper
provides practitioners, academics, engineers, technicians, policymakers, and other
stakeholders with insights into how to use advanced IoT and advanced AI techniques
to improve the efficiency, sustainability, and safety of the sanitation industry for
development. This paper categorizes intelligent sanitation systems driven by IoT and
AI into three main areas: system detection, health monitoring, and AI enhancement
(Figure 1). These categories encompass the key functionalities and applications of
modern intelligent sanitation technologies.

2. Review method and results
2.1. Review approaches
The inclusion and exclusion criteria from the Preferred Reporting Items for
Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines are applied to conduct
a thorough literature review (Liberati et al., 2009). The PRISMA flow diagram
illustrates the different phases of materials being identified, screened, analyzed,
included, and excluded (see Figure 2). To identify high-impact intelligent sanitation
research findings, the literature review approach is as below:
⚫
Identify relevant databases (ACM, IEEE Xplore, PubMed, and Science Direct)
and keywords “sanitation” OR “toilet” AND (“intelligent” OR “smart” OR “IoT”
OR “internet of things” OR “sensor”) are used in the search for journals, papers,
articles, studies, reports and proceedings from both academic and industrial
perspectives. ACM, IEEE Xplore, PubMed, and ScienceDirect were selected
because they are highly relevant to our review’s focus on IoT and AI for
intelligent sanitation systems, offering specialized and pertinent articles. While
Scopus and Web of Science are extensive, the chosen databases better align with
the study’s key areas.
⚫
Screen the resulting articles based on inclusion and exclusion criteria (published
in English from 2000 to 2022 are included; peer-reviewed literature, grey
literature, reputable articles, and authoritative reports are included; textbooks,
industrial documentation, schematics, patents and low-quality material are
excluded; sanitation related literature that does not incorporate advanced
electronic, IoT and advanced AI techniques is excluded).
⚫
The initial review process involves screening the titles and abstracts of literature
and eliminating those that do not match the intelligent sanitation topics. The
assessment of full-text articles involves considering the type of publication, type
of study, and quality of the article.
⚫
Extract data from the included articles and synthesize the findings.
⚫
Analyze and interpret the literature review results.

2.2. Information extraction and quality assessment
The relevance of the study, type of publication, availability of full text, quality
and language of materials are considered when evaluating literature. High-quality,
high-cited journals and articles, reputable reports published by organizations and
governments, as well as inspiring and innovative material are included. Unpublished
papers, industrial documents, non-peer reviewed material, generic and uninnovative
articles, non-English written papers, low-quality and low-citation articles are excluded.
In accordance with the PRISMA protocol, the process for including studies in the
review was conducted with the input of two authors. In cases where there was a
disagreement between the two authors regarding the inclusion of a study, a third
reviewer was consulted to make the final decision on whether or not to include the
study.

2.3. Review results analysis
To consolidate the fragmented research work, this paper thoroughly reviews
more than 141 sanitation and toilet-related papers from 2000 to 2022, selected from
an initial pool of 5154 articles retrieved from the ACM, IEEE Xplore, PubMed, and
ScienceDirect databases. The intelligent sanitation solutions have been reviewed from

system detection, health monitoring, and AI enhancement standpoints. Intelligent
sanitation, also known as smart sanitation, intelligent toilets, smart toilets, or electronic
toilets, refers to sanitation systems that integrate advanced technologies such as
sensors, automation, IoT and AI techniques to enhance efficiency, hygiene, and
resource management (Gong et al., 2020). Intelligent sanitation encompasses features
such as self-cleaning capabilities, automated system operation, water-saving flushes,
and health monitoring. Over the past two decades, there has been a significant increase
in the quantity and quality of papers published on intelligent sanitation (see Figure 3
and Table 1). Between 2000 and 2005, sanitation, as a topic, has received relatively
little attention, and they do not specifically focus on the area of intelligent sanitation.
However, from 2005 to 2015, there was a gradual increase in attention to this field,
with a slow and steady rise in the number of relevant publications. Starting from 2005,
the field of electronics integrated sanitation systems began to gain traction in databases
related to computer science, electrical engineering, and electronics, such as ACM and
IEEE Xplore. From 2000 to 2015, there were few studies on intelligent sanitation for
health monitoring in life sciences and biomedical-related databases such as PubMed.
From 2015 to 2020, there was a notable surge in the number of studies conducted on
intelligent sanitation. This increase can be attributed to the development of advanced
architecture, applications, and services of IoT and AI techniques, which in turn
attracted more researchers to this field of study.
Since 2022, with the evolution of technology such as ubiquitous computing,
commodity sensors, embedded systems, wireless networks, and machine learning,
intelligent sanitation has gained greater recognition and adoption (Singh and Jayaram,
2022). Advanced AI brings great potential for intelligent sanitation. AI can be used to
control and optimize various components of intelligent sanitation systems, including
water flow, temperature, and waste management. By analyzing data from sensors and
other sources, algorithms can adjust system parameters in real-time, ensuring optimal
performance and resource efficiency. Predictive maintenance can predict and prevent
equipment failures and maintenance issues, reducing downtime and minimizing repair
costs. User behavior analysis can be used to optimize system design, improve user
experience, and promote better hygiene and sanitation practices. Health monitoring
can help to identify potential outbreaks of infectious diseases and enable early
intervention and treatment. While intelligent sanitation is gaining increasing attention,
it still remains underdeveloped when compared to other smart industrial applications.

3. Intelligent sanitation for system detection
Intelligent sanitation has the potential to significantly improve system and
operation efficiency, safety, and performance. The systems equipped with sensors and
software for data collection and exchange. Household intelligent sanitation systems
incorporated sensors for automated functions. Atta (2013) used pH sensors for
automatic flushing, while Amat Azhar et al. (2013) integrated infrared and float
sensors. Boonyakan et al. (2018) designed a microcontroller-based system for
cleanliness-based flushing. Intelligent systems can detect anomalies and emergencies
(Cid et al., 2020; Zakaria et al., 2018). User behavior analysis enhances system
performance, as demonstrated by Cotera Rivera and Bilton’s (2021) multi-sensor toilet.
Public sanitation facilities benefit from IoT-based monitoring and control. Wan
Mohammed et al. (2013) created a sensor-equipped public toilet for automated
operations. Dutta (2016) focused on automatic flushing for cleaner public facilities.
Karthikeyan and Namekar (2018) developed a sensor-rich public toilet for
environmental monitoring. Advanced mobile devices enable user participation in
maintaining public sanitation (Shaikh et al., 2019).
Sanitation data is employed to monitor and manage intelligent assets, enabling
users to gain a more comprehensive understanding of sanitation facilities (Amat Azhar
et al., 2013; Atta, 2013; Boonyakan et al., 2018). Data collected from various sources
is used to detect possible issues and inefficiencies in the sanitation system, leading to
enhanced system performance and reduced chances of breakdowns (Dutta, 2016; Wan
Mohammed et al., 2013). Sensors can detect changes in the sanitation environment
and automatically make adjustments to the system, decreasing the necessity for
manual labor and boosting system efficiency (Deshmukh et al., 2020; Ramasamy et
al., 2018; Shaikh et al., 2019). Intelligent sanitation systems provide cleaners with the
most up-to-date toilet cleanliness data via an interactive app, reducing unnecessary
over-cleaning and increasing sanitation resource management flexibility. Users can
view toilet occupancy rates to reduce queuing and increase usage (Cai et al., 2019;
Namekar and Karthikeyan, 2018; Raendran et al., 2020). Intelligent sanitation systems
have the capability to notify operators, users, and managers of any possible issues. The
system can promptly send alerts to concerned parties, enhancing safety, taking
appropriate measures, mitigating accident risks, and addressing issues in a timely
manner (Cid et al., 2020; Cotera Rivera and Bilton, 2021; Zakaria et al., 2018).
Intelligent sanitation systems can acquire valuable insights into how users interact with
facilities, services, and applications. These insights can be leveraged to enhance user
experiences and promote user safety. By analyzing user behavior patterns, these
systems can identify areas for improvement and make necessary adjustments, resulting
in a more optimal user experience (Bimantara et al., 2022; Liang, 2020; Lokman and
Ramasamy, 2019; Turman-Bryant et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2022).

4. Intelligent sanitation for health monitoring
Intelligent sanitation for continuous health monitoring detects disease at an
earlier stage, greatly benefiting public health. By connecting sanitation facilities to the
internet, doctors and patients can track vital signs, monitor treatments, and receive
remote medical advice (Huang et al., 2012; Tasoglu, 2022; Tanaka et al., 2006).
11

Journal of Infrastructure, Policy and Development 2024, 8(12), 7889.

Tanaka et al. (2006) developed a toilet for continuous blood pressure monitoring.
Huang et al. (2012) created an intelligent toilet that detects unconscious biosignals,
including ECG for cardiac performance, bio-impedance for body composition analysis,
and pressure sensors for weight measurement. These advancements enable timely
treatment, accurate decisions, and comprehensive health insights, especially beneficial
for the elderly.
Human excreta, such as urine and faeces, contain a wealth of information and are
produced in large quantities on a daily basis, but it is not used, monitored, or analysed.
Early intelligent toilets only measured the colour of the urine and required the user to
manually sample, resulting in a poor user experience (Temirel et al., 2021). With
advanced IoT technologies, the latest intelligent toilets are now fully automated and
capable of measuring dozens of health parameters, such as white blood cells, red blood
cells, glucose, and bilirubin (Oyaert and Delanghe, 2019). Kim and Allen (2016)
developed a low-cost urine glucose analysis toilet. Bae and Lee (2018) created a
system separating urine for health analysis and faeces for biofertilizer. Intelligent
sanitation enables remote monitoring for chronic patients, reducing healthcare costs.
Park et al. (2020) proposed a toilet for non-invasive, continuous health monitoring
through excreta measurement.
Cloud platforms, machine learning, and computer vision are integrated with
intelligent toilets to provide comprehensive insights into user health (Park et al., 2020).
Given that toilet use is an inherently intimate activity, the development of intelligent
toilets must take into account user expectations, acceptance, and privacy concerns
(Sulmasy et al., 2017). Some privacy protection methods are used to prevent personal
health data from being leaked, and user information is only shared with authorized
stakeholders (Bettiga et al., 2020). Future advanced intelligent toilets will incorporate
security protocols, access control mechanisms, regulatory protection, encryption
algorithms, and blockchain technologies to securely manage health data (Esposito et
al., 2018; Maher et al., 2019; Schönberger, 2019; Wang et al., 2019; Xiao et al., 2012).
Personal diagnosis and community health monitoring are improved by intelligent
sanitation facilities (Rary et al., 2020). During COVID-19, the Coronavirus: Integrated
Diagnostic (COV-ID) toilet is proposed to replace traditional nasopharyngeal swabbased flow testing for SARS-COV-2 detection (Ge et al., 2022). The intelligent toilet
is suitable for both public and private restrooms (Kumar et al., 2022). The intelligent
sanitation has given the elderly and disabled unprecedented freedom and
independence. The elderly and disabled have easier and more convenient access to
sanitation facilities and services than ever before (Molenbroek et al., 2011; Mohanty
and Mohanty, 2019; Panek et al., 2011; Pilissy et al., 2017; Swathy et al., 2022; Yoon
et al., 2018). Furthermore, the intelligent sanitation systems can be linked to home
security systems, allowing the elderly and disabled to live safely and securely even
when living alone (Akaho and Yoshioka, 2022; Balaceanu et al., 2019; Taniguchi et
al., 2014; Tsuchiyama and Kajiwara, 2019). The EU’s ‘Friendly Rest Room’ project
aims to enhance autonomy and safety for elderly and disabled users. Molenbroek and
De Bruin (2011) explored cross-disciplinary technologies for efficient, user-friendly
facilities. Taniguchi et al. (2014) developed a camera-based system to detect falls and
monitor elderly users’ proximity to danger zones. The majority of existing studies on
intelligent sanitation for health monitoring are randomized and small-scale, have not

been developed, deployed, or tested in the field, and are still in the conceptual stage.
The incorporation of biosensors into sanitation facilities is a novel topic that has the
potential to improve global health systems.

5. Intelligent sanitation with Artificial Intelligence
AI-enhanced intelligent sanitation can lead to improved decision making,
automated actions, predictive maintenance, and better customer experience.
Algorithms can identify patterns in data, detect correlations, and predict system
performance (See-To et al., 2022; Turman-Bryant et al., 2020). The IoT, data analytics
and machine learning are powerful tools that can be used in tandem to interpret, learn,
analyse, and predict the sanitation environment. Sensors detect environmental changes
and measure physical properties such as temperature, odour, and cleanliness. Machine
learning is used to forecast the future sanitation environment by analysing historical
data (Deshmukh et al., 2020). Computer vision is becoming increasingly important in
health analysis. Excrement image analysis detects abnormalities in urine and faeces
faster than traditional manual analysis, allowing for more timely and effective
treatment (Park et al., 2020; Syafaah et al., 2020; Wang and Camilleri, 2020). It is
critical to ensure that sanitation data is properly secured and that privacy is maintained.
Data encryption, authentication, anonymization, and pseudonymization are essential
to prevent unauthorised parties from accessing the health data (Ganesapillai et al.,
2022; Zhang et al., 2021).
AI-enhanced solutions can be used to monitor sanitation system performance in
real-time and identify any potential issues or component failures. Intelligent systems
can analyze large volumes of data generated by the sanitation facilities and provide
alerts or notifications when any anomalies are detected. Turman-Bryant et al. (2020)
used machine learning algorithms to predict tank overflow risk and optimize waste
collection in intelligent toilets. The Lasso regression, multivariate adaptive regression,
and random forests algorithms are used to develop predictive models. Using machine
learning, the toilets were able to balance waste collection efficiency and the frequency
of overflow events. Intelligent sanitation provides environmental sensing to improve
visibility, reduce costs and manage operations. Deshmukh et al. (2020) proposed an
intelligent sanitation solution to monitor the cleanliness of public toilets. The system
involves the installation of odor and air sensors, and an autoregressive integrated
moving average (ARIMA) model is utilised to analyze historical time series data,
enabling the prediction of future trends in the surrounding environment. See-To et al.
(2022) deployed a range of sensing technologies, including environmental, odor, and
light sensors, electrical operation meters, and water capacity meters, on public
sanitation facilities. To predict the operational status, the systems employed a
convolutional bidirectional long short-term memory model. This model analyses timeseries data from the various sensors, enabling the accurate prediction of future trends
and facilitating more efficient management of public sanitation facilities.
The combination of AI and intelligent sanitation solutions has the potential to
bring about significant improvements to the overall health and wellbeing of
individuals and communities. Computer vision algorithms can be used to analyze the
color and shape of excrement for the purpose of detecting health status. This approach

is still in the early stages of development and further research is needed to determine
its effectiveness and feasibility as a diagnostic tool. Syafaah et al. (2020) installed a
camera as a color sensor in a toilet to collect images of urine samples and a Raspberry
Pi as the main control unit. The camera captures images to generate a red-green-blue
(RGB) color model. This RGB model is then analyzed and clustered using the Kmeans algorithm, which enabled the classification of the urine as either diabetic or
normal. This approach shows promise as a potential non-invasive and cost-effective
diagnostic tool for diabetes, although further research is needed to validate its accuracy
and reliability. Park et al. (2020) utilised computer vision techniques to measure urine
flow by analyzing camera-captured urine depth information and constructing a 3D
model of the urine stream using geometric averages. In addition, they used a
convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify feces images as constipated, normal,
or diarrheal, achieving an average accuracy of 64.28%. These approaches have
potential applications in the diagnosis and monitoring of various urinary and bowel
disorders.
Intelligent sanitation has the potential to revolutionize the way of health
monitoring by providing real-time data on individual bodily functions. This approach
has several advantages, including non-invasiveness, ease of use, and low cost. While
intelligent sanitation systems have great potential for health care, they also pose
significant challenges in terms of data privacy and security. Storage and protection of
sensitive data collected by sensors and actuators are main challenges. As this data is
typically stored on different system components, the security configuration of these
assets may be weak and vulnerable to attack. Attackers may attempt to steal historical
system operational data and patient physiology data, potentially compromising the
privacy of health information. Furthermore, transferring healthcare data from physical
devices to remote servers with lax security measures can raise the risk of data leakage.
This is particularly concerning as health data is highly sensitive and should be
protected against unauthorized access or disclosure. To address these challenges, it is
essential to implement robust data security and privacy protection measures, such as
encryption, access controls, and secure data storage. Additionally, it is crucial to
comply with relevant data protection regulations and standards, such as the General
Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). Zhang et al. (2021) proposed an intelligent toilet
that addresses privacy concerns by identifying the user using frictional electrical
sensors instead of traditional camera or RFID technology. The system transmits urine
and feces analysis results to a cloud system, which are then displayed on mobile
devices in a secure manner. By implementing robust data security and privacy
protection measures, researchers and healthcare professionals can leverage intelligent
sanitation systems to gain valuable insights into health status while ensuring the
protection of sensitive health information.

6. Discussion
Intelligent sanitation systems collect, store, exchange, and act on sanitation data,
allowing for unprecedented automation and optimization. The IoT and advanced AI
techniques provide users with accessibility, functionality and analyzability for
sanitation facilities. Intelligent sanitation systems bring numerous opportunities in

14

Journal of Infrastructure, Policy and Development 2024, 8(12), 7889.

smart assets, data storage, data processing, data analysis, and intelligent service (Li et
al., 2018; Pal, 2022; Srivastava et al., 2020). They also present several challenges,
such as coverage and communication, compatibility and interoperability, privacy and
security, scalability and deployment (Alwarafy et al., 2020; Koohang et al., 2022;
Kouicem et al., 2018; Ogonji et al., 2018; Othman et al., 2022; Yang et al., 2020). This
section provides a comprehensive analysis of intelligent sanitation systems, evaluating
their current strengths and weaknesses while exploring future opportunities and
challenges. By examining both present capabilities and potential developments, we
offer a balanced perspective on the evolving landscape of smart sanitation
technologies.

6.1. Strengths and weaknesses of current intelligent sanitation systems
Strengths: Intelligent sanitation systems represent a significant leap forward in
resource management and public health. These systems leverage real-time monitoring
and automated control to optimize the usage of critical resources, particularly water
and energy. This optimization not only reduces waste but also substantially lowers
operational costs, making sanitation more sustainable and economically viable. By
facilitating timely cleaning and maintenance, intelligent sanitation systems play a
crucial role in public health management. They can detect potential health hazards
early, enabling swift interventions that prevent the spread of diseases. This capability
is particularly valuable in urban environments, where the rapid identification of
pathogens or disease markers can lead to more effective and targeted public health
measures. Moreover, the wealth of data collected by these systems serves as a
powerful tool for urban planners and policymakers. It provides invaluable insights that
inform decision-making processes in various areas, from resource allocation to public
health policy formulation. This data-driven approach ensures that urban development
and public health initiatives are more responsive to actual needs and challenges.
Weaknesses: The implementation of these intelligent sanitation systems comes
with substantial financial implications. The integration of intelligent sanitation
infrastructure, especially in public spaces, often requires significant upfront
investments. These costs encompass not only the installation of new technology but
also its integration with existing infrastructure, which can be particularly challenging
in older urban environments. Moreover, the reliance on technology introduces new
vulnerabilities to the sanitation sector. Intelligent systems depend on a constant power
supply, which can be problematic in areas with unreliable electricity infrastructure.
This dependence not only limits the geographical applicability of these systems but
also raises concerns about service continuity during power outages. The maintenance
of intelligent sanitation systems presents another set of challenges. These advanced
systems often require specialized expertise for repairs and upkeep, which can lead to
longer downtimes compared to traditional sanitation facilities. This complexity not
only increases operational costs but also demands a workforce with new skill sets,
potentially creating challenges in areas lacking such specialized technical knowledge.
The increased complexity of intelligent sanitation systems makes them potential
targets for cyber-attacks, which could disrupt essential sanitation services and
compromise user data. The collection of personal health data and usage patterns, while

15

Journal of Infrastructure, Policy and Development 2024, 8(12), 7889.

valuable for health monitoring and system optimization, raises critical questions about
data security and user anonymity. Ensuring the protection of this sensitive information
remains a formidable challenge, particularly in an era of increasing cyber threats.
There are also significant social and ethical considerations. The advanced nature of
intelligent sanitation systems may inadvertently widen the digital divide, potentially
excluding populations without access to or familiarity with smart devices. This
technological barrier could exacerbate existing inequalities, particularly in less
developed regions or among older populations. The use of AI in health monitoring and
decision-making within these systems raises profound ethical questions. Issues of
personal autonomy, informed consent, and the potential for algorithmic bias must be
carefully considered. As these systems become more prevalent, society must grapple
with the balance between technological advancement and individual rights, ensuring
that the benefits of intelligent sanitation are realized without compromising
fundamental ethical principles.

6.2. Opportunities for future intelligent sanitation systems
Smart assets: Smart sanitation assets play a critical role in the development of
intelligent sanitation systems. Smart assets are equipped with sensors that can sense,
measure, detect, and monitor a range of variables, including operational and mode
information, temperature, pressure, speed, vital signs, and user behavior. Embedded
sensors are becoming more affordable, smaller, more accurate, and more efficient,
making it possible to deploy intelligent sanitation facilities on a larger scale.
With advanced network communications, low bandwidth costs, and stable data
transmission, smart assets are becoming more connected, facilitating the seamless
sharing of data. Smartphones are also becoming more widely available, improving the
interaction between humans and machines. Sensors monitor systems, users, and
environments, enabling informed decisions and better resource utilisation such as
industrial automation, energy efficiency, water management, and waste management.
AI-enabled smart assets can analyze collected data to identify patterns, predict
future events, identify potential issues, and develop efficient solutions. Additionally,
smart assets are continuously improving hardware to support a wide range of
innovative sanitation solutions. Smart sanitation assets are essential in the
development of intelligent sanitation systems that promote sustainable and efficient
resource utilisation while improving the quality of user life.
Data pre-processing: Sanitation data often comes from multiple sources and is in
different formats, making it challenging to extract, transform, and load into a data
storage destination. Data pre-processing is essential to ensure the accuracy and
consistency of sanitation data, which allows stakeholders to analyze the data, identify
trends, and provide users with timely and efficient information (Sreemathy et al.,
2021).
Sanitation smart assets collect a large amount of data, which frequently contains
low-quality data. This necessitates data quality management to ensure that the data is
of sufficient quality to derive meaningful insights. The quality of the data directly
influences the quality of the insights obtained from data analysis. Data cleaning is a

16

Journal of Infrastructure, Policy and Development 2024, 8(12), 7889.

critical step in data quality management, as it can identify the data source, verify data
accuracy and security, and remove inaccurate, incomplete, and irrelevant data.
Manual data cleaning can be less efficient and requires extensive knowledge of
the data context. Automated tools, such as data wrangling software or batch processing
via scripting, can quickly identify and eliminate errors and inconsistencies. Data
cleaning involves replacing, modifying, and deleting dirty or coarse data, as well as
organizing data into meaningful formats. This improves the accuracy and reliability of
data analysis and ensures that the insights derived from the data are accurate and
actionable (Chu et al., 2016; Hajjaji et al., 2021; Majeed et al., 2021).
Data storage: Advanced technologies are shaping data storage trends. Edge
computing stores sanitation data at the edge of the network, closer to the source of data
generation, reducing latency, accelerating data processing, and enabling smart assets
to make faster decisions. Edge computing does not send data over the Internet, which
reduces the risk of data leakage and provides more control and security for data
management (Chang et al., 2021; Shi et al., 2016; Yu et al., 2017).
Distributed storage stores sanitation data across a network of multiple locations
to provide data availability, reliability, and scalability. Sanitation data is stored
redundantly across multiple nodes in a network of interconnected devices, so that if
one node fails, the others can still access it normally (Tajeddine et al., 2018).
Cloud storage is a secure and reliable way to remotely store, access, back up, and
manage sanitation data over the internet. Cloud storage solutions reduce the cost of
data management by eliminating the need for expensive storage equipment and instead
relying on secure and cost-effective products developed by cloud providers (Ren et al.,
2021; Yang et al., 2020).
Flash storage devices are a popular choice for data storage due to their small size,
fast speeds, and low power consumption (Raza et al., 2016). Blockchain enables users
and stakeholders to verify data integrity by providing a secure, tamper-proof method
of storing and managing data (Novo, 2018; Reyna et al., 2018; Wang et al., 2020).
End-to-end encryption protocols and strong authentication methods are deployed to
protect data. AI is used to automate repetitive tasks to analyse and interpret data more
quickly. Machine learning storage solutions offer improved data compression,
deduplication, and real-time analytics capabilities (Adi et al., 2020; Al‐Turjman et al.,
2022; Hua et al., 2022; Hussain et al., 2020).
Data analytics: Sophisticated techniques, technologies, and computational
models are employed to extract insights, identify patterns and associations, and make
informed decisions from sanitation data. To examine massive and rapidly evolving
sanitation data, a range of statistical methods and machine learning algorithms such as
clustering analysis, cohort analysis, regression analysis, neural networks, factor
analysis, data mining, text analysis, time series analysis, decision trees, and conjoint
analysis are frequently utilised (LaValle et al., 2011; Li et al., 2021; Tsai et al., 2015).
The use of AI and machine learning will be the primary focus for data analytics
in the future. These technologies will automate analysis and decision-making, as well
as uncover patterns that may not be detectable by humans. Predictive analytics will
forecast future trends and behaviours based on historical sanitation data, while
sanitation equipment will predict failures by utilizing previous performance to avoid
damage. AI will also identify patterns and trends in sanitation facility operations to
17

Journal of Infrastructure, Policy and Development 2024, 8(12), 7889.

automate equipment calibration and maintenance, reducing time, labour, and expenses
related to sanitation network management (Ghosh et al., 2018). By combining data
security and analytics, the risk of data breaches and cyber attacks is reduced. Data
encryption, authentication protocols, and access controls ensure that data remains
secure and is only accessible to authorized users (Mohanta et al., 2020).
Intelligent service: The intelligent sanitation enables a wide variety of
applications and services, such as remote monitoring and control, interactive
visualisation, predictive maintenance, optimised resource usage, and improved
healthcare. Remote monitoring and control enable users to monitor and manage
sanitation systems from a distance, increasing efficiency and reducing maintenance
costs. Interactive visualisation tools provide real-time insights into sanitation data,
helping users to understand the system performance and identify areas for
improvement. Predictive maintenance uses artificial intelligence algorithms to
forecast equipment failures based on historical data, allowing users to take preventive
measures before any issues occur. Predictive maintenance can reduce the risk of
facility failure, save time and cost, and increase user satisfaction (Dalzochio et al.,
2020). Optimised resource usage ensures that sanitation facilities operate at maximum
efficiency, reducing water and energy usage and lowering operational costs. Intelligent
sanitation can also improve public health by monitoring and controlling infectious
diseases, detecting and responding to outbreaks, and ensuring the cleanliness of public
spaces. Intelligent sanitation can provide more efficient, effective and patient-centred
healthcare solutions. It tracks vital signs, monitors health status and alerts to potential
illnesses. Historical medical data is securely stored and shared, allowing medical
personnel to diagnose and treat patients quickly and accurately. The smart asset in
intelligent sanitation systems can be accessed, managed, and monitored remotely, and
the sensors and actuators installed in the system have real-time automatic control and
adjustment capabilities. This allows for efficient and effective management of
sanitation systems, reducing the need for manual intervention and improving overall
system performance.

6.3. Challenges for future intelligent sanitation systems
Coverage and communication: The physical coverage and network
communication limitations of sanitation networks can be a challenge for the
deployment of intelligent sanitation systems. Sanitation facilities are often spread
across large areas and located in complex environments, such as urban areas with highrise buildings and underground infrastructure, which can hinder the deployment and
operation of network access points, sensors, and other equipment. In addition, the
terrain, weather conditions, and other factors can also affect the performance and
reliability of the communication networks used to connect the various components of
the system.
As the number of interconnected smart assets increases, establishing reliable,
low-latency connectivity between them can become a significant challenge. Collecting
and transforming large amounts of data between smart assets can also give rise to
several issues. The data may need to be standardized, cleaned, and preprocessed before
it can be analyzed effectively. In addition, data privacy and security concerns may

18

Journal of Infrastructure, Policy and Development 2024, 8(12), 7889.

arise due to the large amount of sensitive information being transmitted between
devices.
Some sanitation facilities are deployed in locations with poor signal, small spaces
blocked by walls and obstructions, resulting in poor data transmission performance.
Existing wireless technologies are prone to interference and signal degradation,
making it impossible to send and receive data consistently. The reliability of wireless
communication can be affected by many factors such as signal interference,
attenuation, and obstacles. In areas with poor signal strength, the transmission of data
between smart assets can be particularly challenging. Walls, buildings, and other
obstructions can block or weaken wireless signals, which can lead to inconsistent or
slow data transmission.
Compatibility and interoperability: The lack of standardisation in the sanitation
sector poses a significant challenge for intelligent sanitation. Different manufacturers
may use different protocols, data formats, communication speeds, and operating
systems, making it difficult to share data and communicate between smart sanitation
facilities. This lack of interoperability can lead to data loss, misplacement, and
incorrect transmission. To address this challenge, industry-wide standards and
protocols need to be developed to ensure seamless communication and data sharing
between sanitation solutions.
To ensure seamless communication between different types of smart assets and
systems, it is essential to establish a unified architecture that utilises common
languages, protocols, and open source standards. This can help ensure compatibility
between different devices, platforms, and technologies and enable easy exchange of
information. Without such integration, communication gaps, interoperability issues,
and difficulty exchanging information can arise, which can hinder the effectiveness of
intelligent sanitation solutions.
Researchers develop standard protocols such as MQTT, CoAP, and AMQP to
enable stable and reliable communication between different smart assets. System
designers develop common open architectures to allow for seamless data exchange
between various devices and services. Cloud-based solutions like Amazon Web
Services (AWS) and Microsoft Azure enable cross-platform device connectivity and
facilitate data transfer.
Privacy and security: The implementation of advanced intelligent sanitation
solutions raises concerns regarding privacy and security. To protect sanitation
networks from damage and prevent data leaks and cyber-attacks, it is essential to
establish robust security protocols and methods to ensure the confidentiality, integrity,
and availability of sanitation data. This includes measures such as access control,
encryption, authentication, and regular security audits to identify vulnerabilities and
potential threats.
The establishment of secure connections between smart assets and the protection
of sanitation data from unauthorized access is critical in sensitive information. This
involves implementing robust security measures to prevent both external and internal
threats such as security breaches, malicious attacks, privacy breaches, and weak
authentication protocols. Measures such as encryption, firewalls, intrusion detection
and prevention systems, and secure authentication protocols can help mitigate these

19

Journal of Infrastructure, Policy and Development 2024, 8(12), 7889.

risks. Regular security audits and vulnerability assessments can also help identify and
address potential weaknesses in the system.
Robust data protection and attack prevention measures are crucial for the
effective implementation of advanced intelligent sanitation solutions. This includes
the development and implementation of security policies and laws, privacy-enhancing
technologies, tools, and standards, secure network connections, and controllable
private information sharing. Additionally, the development of privacy policies and
guidelines can help ensure that personal information is collected, used, and stored in
compliance with legal and ethical standards. Moreover, ensuring the security and
privacy of user data should be a top priority, and the development of transparent and
understandable privacy policies and guidelines can help build trust among users. By
adopting a comprehensive approach to security and privacy, stakeholders can ensure
that advanced intelligent sanitation solutions deliver their intended benefits without
compromising user trust and system security.
Scalability and deployment: The evolution of intelligent sanitation has resulted
in the integration of more facilities, devices, data, and users, which poses a challenge
in scaling up the system effectively. As the system grows, it becomes more complex,
and there is an increased need for coordination among different stakeholders,
including government agencies, utilities, and private companies. Scaling up the system
requires careful planning and coordination to ensure that the necessary infrastructure
is in place to support increased data collection, processing, and storage. This may
require upgrading or replacing existing infrastructure, implementing new technologies,
and developing new policies and guidelines. Additionally, stakeholders must address
issues related to data ownership, sharing, and management to ensure that the system
operates smoothly and efficiently.
The successful scaling of intelligent sanitation systems requires a comprehensive
and collaborative approach that addresses issues related to interoperability, data
quality, and network scalability. Interoperability is a key requirement for scaling up
intelligent sanitation systems. As the number of facilities, devices, and data sources
increases, it becomes increasingly important for these systems to communicate and
exchange data accurately. This requires the development of standard protocols,
interfaces, and data formats that allow different components of the system to
interoperate seamlessly. Moreover, as the volume of data packets increases, scalable
solutions must be able to avoid network congestion while maintaining a good user
experience. By adopting best practices and leveraging innovative technologies,
stakeholders can ensure that the system operates efficiently, effectively, and
sustainably, while delivering meaningful benefits to users and the environment.
