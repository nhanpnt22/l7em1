Postgraduate researchers

Cranfield is a specialist, postgraduate-only university with a total
population of 1780 staff and ~800 postgraduate research students.
Our action plan predominantly builds on key initiatives established in
the previous reporting period with a focus on communicating and
embedding these to ensure positive cultural change for the whole
target population (researchers and the academic staff that manage
and support them).

Flexible working, and specifically the hybrid model of working is fully
established at the University and has been for approximately 2 years.
We have recently updated a number of policies, including flexible
working; leave in special circumstances, which further support our
practices of flexible working at both a formal and informal level. these
policies will be reviewed by Working Families by end January 2024. In
October 2023, Cranfield was recognised for the 2nd year in a row in the
Top 30 Employers by Working Families, 1 of only 2 universities. This
recognition is largely linked to our culture of flexibility and our strong
organisational commitment to flexible working across the organisation.

The aims of these obligations are to ensure recruitment of researchers is open and fair and researchers receive effective inductions into the organisation.

EI1

Ensure open, transparent and merit-based recruitment,
which attracts excellent researchers, using fair and
inclusive selection and appointment practices.

Recruitment monitoring is embedded under our EDI strategy to 2027.
As part of this strategy we have committed to relaunching our candidate
experience survey, and undertaking a pilot to share interview questions
with candidates before interviews. We will be establishing new self
assessment teams for AdvanceHE's Athena Swan and Race Equality
charters which will see recruitment related actions embedded further.
CEDARS responses from 2023, stated 92% of respondees stated they
agreed or strongly agreed their recruitment process was fair, 84%
inclusive and 80% transparent. We continue to monitor our recruitment
data and the trends are positive in terms of attracting and appointing
peopel from underreprsnted groups at cranfield, including women in

where a move to permanency is possible, in line with the business
context and funding position. 33% of our researchers are on open-ended
contracts and redundancy rates for this staff category over the previous

Researchers take ownership of their career, identifying
opportunities to work towards career goals, including
engaging in a minimum of 10 days professional
development pro rata per year.

Promote awareness through the PDR cycle, intranet
announcements, ECR network and monitor uptake of development
time. Through the PDR cycle, ensure that researchers are
proactively agreeing a personal development plan and seek
development opportunities, actively undertaking a minimum of 10
days personal development per annum (pro rata). Sample check
against PDRs to ensure development plans are in place.

Cranfield is proud of our close links with business, industry and

paths for many years, with frequent movement of staff to and from
industry roles in particular. Our staff have plentiful opportunities to
interact with non-academic partners and a strong track record of
successfully articulating research problems and solutions in a real-world
context. In addition, the ECR Network hosts career development talks
as part of their monthly seminar series and thus, we feel progress
towards this obligation is sufficiently embedded in institutional practice
and our focus is on supporting transitions through the academic
pathway.

* The Researcher Development Concordat defines researchers as individuals whose primary responsibility is to conduct research and who are employed specifically for this purpose by a higher education institution or research institute. The primary audience is research staff, e.g. postdoctoral researchers, research fellows, research assistants. The Researcher
Development Concordat encourages institutions to include other groups who actively engage in research as beneficiaries of their Concordat action plan. These could be postgraduate researchers; staff on teaching and research, or teaching contracts; clinicians; professional support staff; technicians.
