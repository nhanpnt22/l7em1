Future of Jobs Report 2025

Preface
Saadia Zahidi
Managing Director
World Economic Forum

Over the past decade, the World Economic Forum’s
bi-annual Future of Jobs Report has followed
evolving technological, societal and economic
trends to understand occupational disruption and
identify opportunities for workers to transition to the
jobs of the future.
As we enter 2025, the landscape of work continues
to evolve at a rapid pace. Transformational
breakthroughs, particularly in generative artificial
intelligence (GenAI), are reshaping industries and
tasks across all sectors. These technological
advances, however, are converging with a broader
array of challenges, including economic volatility,
geoeconomic realignments, environmental
challenges and evolving societal expectations. In
response, this fifth edition of the Future of Jobs
Report expands its focus, offering a comprehensive
analysis of the interconnected trends shaping the
global labour market.
Central to the report is a unique dataset derived
from an extensive survey of global employers. This
year’s edition captures the perspectives of over
1,000 employers – representing more than 14
million workers across 22 industry clusters and 55
economies – providing unparalleled insights into

the emerging jobs landscape for the 2025-2030
period. This report would not be possible without
their openness to contributing their views and
insights, and we sincerely thank them all. We greatly
appreciate, too, the support of our survey partners,
which have enhanced the report’s geographical
coverage.
These perspectives are further enriched by research
collaborations and data partnerships with ADP,
Coursera, Indeed and LinkedIn, whose innovative
data and analysis complement the survey findings.
This publication has been made possible by the
dedication and expertise of its project team:
Till Leopold, Attilio Di Battista, Ximena Játiva,
Shuvasish Sharma, Ricky Li and Sam Grayling,
alongside the wider team at the Centre for the New
Economy and Society.
The disruptions of recent years have underscored
the importance of foresight and collective action.
We hope this report will inspire an ambitious,
multistakeholder agenda – one that equips workers,
businesses, governments, educators and civil
society to navigate the complex transitions ahead.

Future of Jobs Report 2025

Key findings
Technological change, geoeconomic fragmentation,
economic uncertainty, demographic shifts and the
green transition – individually and in combination
– are among the major drivers expected to shape
and transform the global labour market by 2030.
The Future of Jobs Report 2025 brings together
the perspective of over 1,000 leading global
employers—collectively representing more than
14 million workers across 22 industry clusters and
55 economies from around the world—to examine
how these macrotrends impact jobs and skills, and
the workforce transformation strategies employers
plan to embark on in response, across the 2025 to
2030 timeframe.
–

–

–

Broadening digital access is expected to be
the most transformative trend – both across
technology-related trends and overall – with
60% of employers expecting it to transform
their business by 2030. Advancements in
technologies, particularly AI and information
processing (86%); robotics and automation
(58%); and energy generation, storage and
distribution (41%), are also expected to be
transformative. These trends are expected to
have a divergent effect on jobs, driving both
the fastest-growing and fastest-declining roles,
and fueling demand for technology-related
skills, including AI and big data, networks and
cybersecurity and technological literacy, which
are anticipated to be the top three fastestgrowing skills.
Increasing cost of living ranks as the secondmost transformative trend overall – and the top
trend related to economic conditions – with
half of employers expecting it to transform
their business by 2030, despite an anticipated
reduction in global inflation. General economic
slowdown, to a lesser extent, also remains
top of mind and is expected to transform 42%
of businesses. Inflation is predicted to have
a mixed outlook for net job creation to 2030,
while slower growth is expected to displace 1.6
million jobs globally. These two impacts on job
creation are expected to increase the demand
for creative thinking and resilience, flexibility, and
agility skills.
Climate-change mitigation is the third-most
transformative trend overall – and the top trend
related to the green transition – while climatechange adaptation ranks sixth with 47% and
41% of employers, respectively, expecting these
trends to transform their business in the next
five years. This is driving demand for roles such
as renewable energy engineers, environmental

engineers and electric and autonomous vehicle
specialists, all among the 15 fastest-growing
jobs. Climate trends are also expected to
drive an increased focus on environmental
stewardship, which has entered the Future of
Jobs Report’s list of top 10 fastest growing skills
for the first time.
–

Two demographic shifts are increasingly seen
to be transforming global economies and
labour markets: aging and declining working
age populations, predominantly in higherincome economies, and expanding working
age populations, predominantly in lower-income
economies. These trends drive an increase
in demand for skills in talent management,
teaching and mentoring, and motivation and
self-awareness. Aging populations drive growth
in healthcare jobs such as nursing professionals,
while growing working-age populations fuel
growth in education-related professions, such
as higher education teachers.

–

Geoeconomic fragmentation and geopolitical
tensions are expected to drive business model
transformation in one-third (34%) of surveyed
organizations in the next five years. Over onefifth (23%) of global employers identify increased
restrictions on trade and investment, as well
as subsidies and industrial policies (21%),
as factors shaping their operations. Almost
all economies for which respondents expect
these trends to be most transformative have
significant trade with the United States
and/or China. Employers who expect
geoeconomic trends to transform their business
are also more likely to offshore – and even more
likely to re-shore – operations. These trends
are driving demand for security related job
roles and increasing demand for network and
cybersecurity skills. They are also increasing
demand for other human-centred skills such
as resilience, flexibility and agility skills, and
leadership and social influence.

Extrapolating from the predictions shared by
Future of Jobs Survey respondents, on current
trends over the 2025 to 2030 period job creation
and destruction due to structural labour-market
transformation will amount to 22% of today’s
total jobs. This is expected to entail the creation
of new jobs equivalent to 14% of today’s total
employment, amounting to 170 million jobs.
However, this growth is expected to be offset by
the displacement of the equivalent of 8% (or 92
million) of current jobs, resulting in net growth of
7% of total employment, or 78 million jobs.

Frontline job roles are predicted to see the
largest growth in absolute terms of volume
and include Farmworkers, Delivery Drivers,
Construction Workers, Salespersons, and Food
Processing Workers. Care economy jobs, such
as Nursing Professionals, Social Work and
Counselling Professionals and Personal Care
Aides are also expected to grow significantly
over the next five years, alongside Education
roles such as Tertiary and Secondary Education
Teachers.
Technology-related roles are the fastestgrowing jobs in percentage terms, including
Big Data Specialists, Fintech Engineers, AI and
Machine Learning Specialists and Software
and Application Developers. Green and energy
transition roles, including Autonomous and
Electric Vehicle Specialists, Environmental
Engineers, and Renewable Energy Engineers,
also feature within the top fastest-growing roles.
Clerical and Secretarial Workers – including
Cashiers and Ticket Clerks, and Administrative
Assistants and Executive Secretaries – are
expected to see the largest decline in absolute
numbers. Similarly, businesses expect the
fastest-declining roles to include Postal Service
Clerks, Bank Tellers and Data Entry Clerks.

On average, workers can expect that two-fifths
(39%) of their existing skill sets will be transformed
or become outdated over the 2025-2030 period.
However, this measure of “skill instability” has
slowed compared to previous editions of the
report, from 44% in 2023 and a high point of 57%
in 2020 in the wake of the pandemic. This finding
could potentially be due to an increasing share of
workers (50%) having completed training, reskilling
or upskilling measures, compared to 41% in the
report’s 2023 edition.
–

Analytical thinking remains the most soughtafter core skill among employers, with seven
out of 10 companies considering it as essential
in 2025. This is followed by resilience, flexibility
and agility, along with leadership and social
influence.

–

AI and big data top the list of fastest-growing
skills, followed closely by networks and
cybersecurity as well as technology literacy.
Complementing these technology-related skills,
creative thinking, resilience, flexibility and agility,
along with curiosity and lifelong learning, are
also expected to continue to rise in importance
over the 2025-2030 period. Conversely, manual
dexterity, endurance and precision stand out
with notable net declines in skills demand, with
24% of respondents foreseeing a decrease in
their importance.

While global job numbers are projected to
grow by 2030, existing and emerging skills
differences between growing and declining
roles could exacerbate existing skills gaps. The

most prominent skills differentiating growing
from declining jobs are anticipated to comprise
resilience, flexibility and agility; resource
management and operations; quality control;
programming and technological literacy.
Given these evolving skill demands, the scale of
workforce upskilling and reskilling expected to be
needed remains significant: if the world’s workforce
was made up of 100 people, 59 would need
training by 2030. Of these, employers foresee that
29 could be upskilled in their current roles and 19
could be upskilled and redeployed elsewhere within
their organization. However, 11 would be unlikely to
receive the reskilling or upkskilling needed, leaving
their employment prospects increasingly at risk.
Skill gaps are categorically considered the biggest
barrier to business transformation by Future of
Jobs Survey respondents, with 63% of employers
identifying them as a major barrier over the 20252030 period. Accordingly, 85% of employers
surveyed plan to prioritize upskilling their workforce,
with 70% of employers expecting to hire staff with
new skills, 40% planning to reduce staff as their
skills become less relevant, and 50% planning to
transition staff from declining to growing roles.
Supporting employee health and well-being is
expected to be a top focus for talent attraction,
with 64% of employers surveyed identifying it
as a key strategy to increase talent availability.
Effective reskilling and upskilling initiatives, along
with improving talent progression and promotion,
are also seen as holding high potential for talent
attraction. Funding for - and provision of - reskilling
and upskilling are seen as the two most welcomed
public policies to boost talent availability.
The Future of Jobs Survey also finds that adoption
of diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives remains
on the rise. The potential for expanding talent
availability by tapping into diverse talent pools is
highlighted by four times more employers (47%)
than two years ago (10%). Diversity, equity and
inclusion initiatives have become more prevalent,
with 83% of employers reporting such an initiative
in place, compared to 67% in 2023. Such
initiatives are particularly popular for companies
headquartered in North America, with a 96%
uptake rate, and for employers with over 50,000
employees (95%).
By 2030, just over half of employers (52%)
anticipate allocating a greater share of their revenue
to wages, with only 8% expecting this share to
decline. Wage strategies are driven primarily by
goals of aligning wages with workers’ productivity
and performance and competing for retaining talent
and skills. Finally, half of employers plan to reorient their business in response to AI, two-thirds
plan to hire talent with specific AI skills, while 40%
anticipate reducing their workforce where AI can
automate tasks.

Introduction:
The global labour
market landscape
in 2025
The year 2025 unfolds amid ongoing
transformations in global labour markets. Since
the COVID-19 pandemic, rising cost of living,
geopolitical conflicts, the climate emergency and
economic downturns have added further turbulence
to technology-driven global employment changes.
While the global economic outlook appears to be
stabilizing, it does so amid weaker global growth
projections of 3.2% for 2025.1 Global inflation
appears to have eased and is now projected
to reach 3.5% by the end of 2025 – below the
average global rate of the first two decades of the
21st century. However, living costs remain elevated
around the world.
Aided by a stabilizing economic outlook and easing
inflation, the global unemployment rate, at 4.9%,2
stands at the lowest level since 1991. However,
this headline figure hides a range of disparities.
While middle-income countries are experiencing
reductions in unemployment, low-income countries
have seen an increase, from 5.1% in 2022 to 5.3%
by 2024.
Reductions in unemployment have also lagged
for women. Since 2020, when the global
unemployment rate peaked for both sexes at 6.6%,
the rate for men has declined to 4.8%, while the
rate for women remains elevated at 5.2%. This
trend is driven mainly by lower-middle income
countries, where the female unemployment rate
(of 5.5%) is 1.1% higher than the male equivalent.
High-income countries have an unemployment rate
gender disparity of 0.4%; however, this disparity
has existed for over a decade – rather than opening
up during the post-COVID recovery. For lowincome and upper-middle income countries, male
and female unemployment rates remain even.
Youth unemployment rates tell another story
of labour-market health. While the global youth
unemployment rate has tracked the total global
unemployment rate, it remains elevated at 13%.
Assessing rates of youth not in employment
education or training (NEETs) highlights disparities
between economies at different national income
levels. While the global NEET rate remains flat at

21.7%, it stands at just 10.1% for high-income
economies, rising to 17.3% for upper-middle
income ones. The rate then jumps to 25.9% for
lower-middle income economies and 27.6% for
low-income ones.
The jobs gap – a measure by the International
Labour Organization (ILO) to incorporate a
broader understanding of unemployment and
underemployment – adds additional nuance to
our understanding of the labour-market situation.
Similarly to global headline unemployment, the jobs
gap has been decreasing and stood at a need for
402 million additional jobs in 2024. While most of
the world has experienced this downward trend,
low-income economies saw their jobs gap increase
by 0.4 percentage points compared to prepandemic levels. Lower-middle income economies
saw the largest reduction in the jobs gap (by 2
percentage points compared to 2019 levels).
Across all country income groups, the jobs gap
for women is higher than that for men, but gender
differences are most pronounced in low-income
and especially lower-income economies, where the
jobs gap for women surpasses that of men by 7.5
percentage points.
The global labour-force participation rate has
rebounded after a drop during the pandemic and
now stands at similar levels to 2019 for all income
groups except lower-middle income economies.
In lower-income economies the labour-force
participation rate has spiked beyond the levels seen
in 2019. This is noteworthy considering lowermiddle income economies – who make up around
40% of the global population – will drive the bulk of
working-age population growth in the coming years
and decades. The combination of growing workingage populations and labour-force participation rates
emphasizes the importance of job creation in these
economies.
Against the backdrop of this current labour-market
landscape, the Future of Jobs Report 2025 analyses
how organizations expect the labour market to
evolve over the next five years until 2030. Like
previous editions of the report, this analysis is
Future of Jobs Report 2025

based on the World Economic Forum’s Future
of Jobs Survey, conducted in late 2024, which
brings together the perspectives of more than
1,000 global employers, collectively employing
more than 14.1 million workers across 22 industry
clusters and 55 economies. The survey highlights
how macrotrends and technology will influence
industry transformation and employment, the jobs
and skills outlook over the next five years and the
corresponding workforce transformation strategies
companies plan to use to address these issues.

and decline fastest, and the trends driving these
changes. Chapter 3 looks at projected changes
to the skills needed in the labour market, before
Chapter 4 analyses the workforce practices that
employers plan to adopt in their organizations.
Finally, Chapter 5 provides insights for the nine
regions, 55 economies, and 22 industry clusters
that meet the report’s statistical thresholds for
standalone analysis. The appendix provides a
detailed overview of the report’s survey and analysis
methodology.

The report begins by outlining five macrotrends
impacting the labour market – technological
change, the green transition, geoeconomic
fragmentation, economic uncertainty and
demographic shifts. In Chapter 2, the report
discusses how organizations expect jobs to
evolve, including which jobs are predicted to grow

In addition, the Future of Jobs Report 2025 features
a comprehensive set of Region, Economy and
Industry Profiles. User guides are provided for each
of these profiles to support their use as practical,

Drivers of
labour-market
transformation
Technological developments, the green transition,
macroeconomic and geoeconomic shifts, and
demographic changes are driving transformation in
the global labour market, reshaping both jobs and

required skills. This chapter provides a picture of
how companies expect these macrotrends to drive
industry transformation by 2030.

More employers – 60% – expect broadening digital
access to transform their business than any other
trend, with similar proportions of employers across

all regions selecting this trend. This growing digital
access is a critical enabler for new technologies to
transform labour markets (Figure 1.1).

Generative AI (GenAI), in particular, has witnessed a
rapid surge in both investment and adoption across
various sectors. Since the release of Chat GPT
in November 2022, investment flows into AI have
increased nearly eightfold.3 This influx of capital has
been accompanied by investment in the physical
infrastructure needed to support these emerging
technologies, including servers and energy
generation plants. By leveraging natural language
processing technology, GenAI enables users to
interact with it as though they were conversing with
a human, considerably reducing barriers to usage
and the need for specialized technical knowledge.4
Accordingly, the demand for GenAI skills by
both businesses and individuals has also grown
significantly (Box B1.1).
Although more generalized adoption of AI
applications remains comparatively low, with only
a small fraction of firms using it in 2023, adoption
is growing rapidly, albeit unevenly across sectors.
The information technology sector is leading
the way in AI adoption, while industries such as
construction are lagging behind.5 This disparity
mirrors broader trends, with advanced and middleincome economies experiencing unprecedented
diffusion of generative AI technologies among
individual users, while low-income economies
remain largely on the margins, with currently
minimal use of this technology.6
While the full extent of long-term productivity
gains from the technology remains uncertain,

workplace studies have identified various initial
ways for generative AI to enhance human
skills and performance. Some of these studies
have highlighted ways for generative AI to
enhance human core skills, or to substitute
for tacit knowledge among newer or average
performing workers.7,8 Other studies have shown
generative AI can enhance knowledge work if
applied appropriately within its capability, but
risks producing adverse outcomes where users
unknowingly stretch it beyond its capability.9
Looking further ahead, some observers argue
generative AI could empower less specialized
employees to perform a greater range of “expert”
tasks – expanding the possible functions of roles
such as Accounting Clerks, Nurses, and Teaching
Assistants.10 Similarly, the technology could
equip skilled professionals such as Electricians,
Doctors or Engineers with the world’s forefront
knowledge – enabling them to solve complex
problems more efficiently.11 Outcomes such as
these – which create genuine shifts in the quantity
or quality of output – are more likely to come about
if technology development is focused on enhancing
rather than substituting for human capabilities.12
However, without appropriate decision-making
frameworks, economic incentive structures and,
possibly, government regulations, there remains a
risk that technological development will be focused
on replacing human work, which could increase
inequality and unemployment.

While currently seen as less transformative than
GenAI, robots and autonomous systems have
seen steady growth of around 5-7% annually since
2020.13 In 2023, global average robot density
reached 162 units per 10,000 employees, double
the number measured seven years ago.14 Currently
robot installations are heavily concentrated,
with 80% of installations occurring in China,
Japan, United States, the Republic of Korea, and

BOX 1.1

Germany.15 This is partially reflected in Future
of Jobs Survey data, which shows significant
expectations for the transformative impact of these
technologies in these five countries (more than
60% of respondents in each); but much lower
expectations among employers headquartered in
Sub-Saharan Africa (39%), Central Asia (45%) and
the Middle East and North Africa (44%).

Demand for generative AI skills
In collaboration with Coursera

Coursera data generated for the Future of Jobs
Report 2025 reveals significant growth in demand
for Generative AI training among both individual
learners and enterprises (Figure B1.1). Demand
for AI skills has accelerated globally, with India
and the United States leading in enrolment
numbers. However, the drivers of demand differ.
In the United States demand is primarily driven
by individual users, whereas in India, corporate
sponsorship plays a significant role in boosting
GenAI training uptake.

conceptual topics, such as prompt engineering,
trustworthy AI practices, and strategic decisionmaking around AI. Institution-sponsored
learners, on the other hand, emphasize practical
applications within the workplace, including
leveraging AI tools to enhance efficiency in
Excel or leveraging the technology to develop
applications. These trends reflect a tailored
approach to GenAI learning, where individuals
focus on foundational knowledge-building while
organizations prioritize training that delivers
immediate workplace productivity gains.

Globally, individual learners on Coursera have
focused on foundational GenAI skills and

Economic uncertainty
As of early 2025, the global economic outlook
appears to be shaped by a combination of
cautious optimism and persistent uncertainties.
According to the World Economic Forum’s
September 2024 Chief Economists Outlook,16
while there are signs of improving global
conditions, vulnerabilities persist. Most surveyed
chief economists (54%) expect economic
conditions to hold steady in the short term.
However, among those anticipating change,
more expect conditions to worsen rather than
strengthen.
The 2024 economic performance was marked by a
global decrease in inflation and an unusually resilient
economy throughout the disinflationary process.
While easing inflation and looser monetary policy
offer some optimism, slow growth and political
volatility keep many countries at risk of economic
shocks. The International Monetary Fund (IMF)
projects growth to hold steady at 3.2 percent in
2025, despite sizable downward growth revisions
in a few economies, particularly low-income
developing ones.17
Despite this comparatively steady outlook, price
pressures persist in many economies. Inflation
remains particularly high in services – at almost twice
pre-pandemic levels – and is especially persistent
in low-income countries. Low-income countries
are disproportionately affected by rising inflationary
pressures because of elevated food prices due to
supply disruptions influenced by climate shocks,
regional conflicts and geopolitical tensions.18
Against this backdrop, companies expect economic
pressures to be among the most transformative
drivers. Figure 1.1 shows rising cost of living remains
a top concern, with half of all surveyed employers
expecting it to drive transformation, making it the
second-most influential trend. Slower economic
growth is also a major concern, with 42% of
respondents expecting it to impact their operations.
Views on the impact of inflation and economic
growth notably vary across regions. For example,
in Sub-Saharan Africa, six in 10 respondents cite
inflation as a key factor, whereas in Eastern and
South-Eastern Asia, slower economic growth is
seen as the more important issue.

larger share of household expenditures in these
countries.19 Globally, governments are responding
to geoeconomic challenges by imposing trade
and investment restrictions, increasing subsidies,
and adjusting industrial policies. The World Trade
Organization (WTO) reports that trade restrictions
doubled between 2020 and 2024, with the value
of import restrictions reaching nearly 10% of global
imports in 2024.20 These increasing protectionist
measures may pose a medium-term risk to global
economic growth, as they reduce opportunities
for open innovation and technology transfer –
factors that historically fuelled growth in emerging
economies during periods of globalization.21
This shift toward geoeconomic fragmentation
carries substantial macroeconomic implications,
with the IMF estimating potential global output
losses from trade fragmentation ranging from 0.2%
to 7% of GDP, and losses deepening in scenarios
of technological decoupling.22 Emerging and
developing economies are particularly vulnerable to
such disruptions. For example, Sub-Saharan Africa
could see long-term welfare losses of approximately
4% of GDP due to declining global integration.23
The Future of Jobs Survey reveals that around onethird (34%) of surveyed employers see heightened
geopolitical tensions and conflicts as a key driver
of organizational transformation. Meanwhile just
over one-fifth of surveyed organizations identify
increased restrictions on trade and investment
(23%), as well as subsidies and industrial policies
(21%), as factors reshaping their operations.
Geoeconomic concerns vary by economy.
Employers in Eastern Asia and Northern America
identify rising geoeconomic fragmentation as a
key driver shaping labour markets, with nearly half
of surveyed employers in these regions citing this
trend. These regions also show significant concern
about restrictions on global trade and investment,
though to a lesser extent than in the Middle East
and North Africa. Economies with comparatively
high trade volumes with the United States, China,
or both – such as Singapore (64%) and the
Republic of Korea (71%) – tend to expect greater
transformation from each of these geoeconomic
trends, as shown in Figure 1.3 below.

Finally, stricter anti-trust and competition
regulations, though a lower priority overall, are
expected to impact one in six employers globally

Geoeconomic fragmentation
Intensifying geoeconomic tensions threaten
trade and supply chains, with lower-income
economies particularly vulnerable, given that
essential goods like food and energy comprise a

On an industry level, as shown in Figure 1.4,
sectors with a high degree of dependence on
global supply chains, such as Automotive and
Aerospace (46%), and Mining and Metals (55%),
expect industry transformation driven by trade
restrictions. By contrast, industries with less
exposure to global markets, such as Education,
are less focused on this trend, with fewer than 14%
of surveyed employers seeing trade restrictions
as disruptive. Mining and Metals, Advanced
Manufacturing, and Oil and Gas anticipate
industry transformation stemming from increased
government subsidies and industrial policies, with,
respectively, 31%, 33%, and 40% of employers
across these industries citing these factors;
whereas more domestic-focused sectors such as
Accommodation, Food, and Leisure expect minimal
impact from such policies.
The broader implications of geoeconomic
fragmentation extend beyond individual business
strategies to long-term economic stability and
growth, and limit multilateral cooperation on critical
issues such as climate change and pandemic
preparedness.24

Green transition
Despite an increasingly complex outlook for global
climate negotiations, the green transition remains
a priority for many organizations globally. Nearly
half of surveyed employers (47%) anticipate the
ramping up of efforts and investments to reduce
carbon emissions as a key driver for organizational
transformation. Similarly, 41% expect that increased
efforts and investments to adapt to climate change
will drive significant organizational changes. These
two trends rank 3rd and 6th, respectively, among
the drivers of business transformation identified by
the Future of Jobs Survey. These priorities have
enabled green jobs to demonstrate resilience in
recent years, with hiring rates in green sectors
remaining relatively stable even throughout the
pandemic-related disruptions of 2020.25

The Future of Jobs Survey finds that the industrial
sector – encompassing industries such as
Automotive and Aerospace, and Mining and
Metals – anticipates significant organizational
transformation as companies ramp up efforts
to decarbonize: 71% of employers in the
Automotive and Aerospace industry and 69% of
those in the Mining and Metals industry expect
carbon emissions reductions to transform their
organizations. Given the carbon-intensive nature of
these industries,26 decarbonization will significantly
transform these industries and their workforces,
with workers requiring upskilling and reskilling to
transition to alternative jobs.
A similar picture emerges across regions. For
example, in South-Eastern Asia, 72% of employers
expect climate mitigation efforts to transform their
Future of Jobs Report 2025

15

organizations by 2030, while over half expect
climate adaptation to do so. By contrast, in Central
Asia, only 19% of respondents see climate trends
as relevant to their business activities.
As countries seek to meet climate goals, questions
arise regarding whether their workforces are
equipped with the necessary skills to meet the
demands of a net-zero future. The shift toward
sustainable practices will require specialized
expertise which will incur transition costs,
particularly for those working in production
occupations such as assemblers and fabricators.27
Despite a global 12% increase in workers acquiring
green skills between 2022 and 2023, demand
continues to outpace supply, with the number
of job postings requiring at least one green skill
rising by nearly 22% over the same period. To fully
capitalize on opportunities created by the green
transition and harness them in a way that is fair and
inclusive, prioritizing green skilling is essential.

Demographic shifts
The world is currently experiencing two fundamental
demographic shifts: an aging and declining
working-age population predominantly in higherincome economies, due to declining birth rates and
longer life expectancy, and a growing working-age
population in many lower-income economies, where
younger populations are progressively entering
the labour market. In higher-income nations,
aging populations are increasing dependency
ratios, potentially putting greater pressure on a
smaller pool of working-age individuals and raising
concerns about long-term labour availability. In
contrast, lower-income economies may benefit from
a demographic dividend.

also relatively tempered, illustrating relatively greater
concern with other macrotrends (Figure 1.5).
Compared to global averages, employers facing
the effects of aging population are more pessimistic
about talent availability and expect facing bigger
challenges in attracting industry talent. More
encouragingly, with a shrinking labour pool, many
of these companies (60%) increasingly prioritize
transitioning current employees into growing roles as
a key workforce strategy. Some observers have also
predicted that aging high-income economies with
shrinking labour forces might increasingly look to
deeper automation to counterbalance some of these
demographic trends.31 For example, the Future of
Jobs Survey finds that employers expecting to be
impacted by aging populations are more likely to
accelerate process automation (79% versus 73%
globally) and advance workforce augmentation (67%
versus 63% globally) in the next five years.
Conversely, many economies’ actual ability to
leverage demographic dividends will depend on
their accompanying success, or otherwise, in
inclusive job creation. According to the World Bank,
over the next 10 years, an unprecedented 1.2
billion young people in emerging economies will
become working-age adults, while the job market
in these economies is only expected to create 420
million additional jobs – risking leaving nearly 800
million young people in economic uncertainty.32
Encouragingly, employers responding to the Future
of Jobs Survey that identify growing working-age
populations as a driver of transformation plan
to prioritize reskilling and upskilling, with 92%
indicating they will be focusing on these strategies
by 2030.

These demographic shifts have a direct impact
on global labour supply: currently balanced
between lower-income (49%) and higher-income
(51%) working-age populations, this distribution
is expected to shift by 2050, with lower-income
countries projected to hold 59% of the global
working-age population.29 Geographies with a
demographic dividend, such as India and SubSaharan African nations, will supply nearly two-thirds
of new workforce entrants in the coming years.30
Findings from the Future of Jobs Survey indicate
that for 40% of employers worldwide, aging and
declining working-age populations are driving
transformation, while 25% are being transformed
by growing working-age populations. Many highincome economies experience the combined
effects of both trends. Certain countries, including
Australia, Germany and Japan, experience more
significant effects from declining working-age
populations. While few companies operating in
Sub-Saharan African countries expect to see
transformation due to aging and declining working
age populations, their expectations regarding the
impact of growing working-age populations are

Jobs outlook
Technological change, the green transition,
economic uncertainty, geoeconomic fragmentation
and demographic shifts are reshaping the labour
market. This chapter analyses how employers

expect various kinds of jobs to grow and decline
in response to these macrotrends and assesses
the role of each of these trends in contributing to
labour-market transformation.

2.1 Total job growth and loss
By combining respondents’ job growth and decline
expectations with hard data on global employment
collected by the ILO, the Future of Jobs Report
2025 estimates that, by 2030, on current
predictions, new job creation and job displacement
due to macrotrends will represent a combined total
of 22% of today’s total (formal) jobs. Specifically,
macrotrend-driven creation of new jobs is estimated
to amount to 170 million jobs, equivalent to 14% of

FIGURE 2.1

today’s total employment. This growth is expected
to be offset by the displacement of 92 million
current jobs, or 8% of total employment, resulting
in a net growth of 78 million jobs (7% of today’s
total employment) by 2030, Figure 2.1 illustrates
the total number of jobs expected to be created
and displaced due to labour-market transformation
relative to total employment today.

Global employment change by 2030
In the next five years, 170 million jobs are projected to be created and 92 million jobs to be displaced, constituting a structural labour
market churn of 22% of the 1.2 billion formal jobs in the dataset being studied. This amounts to a net employment increase of 7%, or 78
million jobs.

Growing and declining jobs
The Future of Jobs Survey gathered insights from
employers on job roles expected to grow, decline
or remain stable within their organizations over

the next five years. Respondents were then asked
to identify the macrotrends and technological
advancements driving job growth and decline in
their organizations.

While technology trends partly contribute to the
growth of security-related roles such as Security
Management Specialists, which ranks among the
top five fastest-growing roles, increased geopolitical
fragmentation contributes in large part to the
growth of this role. Driven by the same combination
of technology and geoeconomic trends, another
security-related role, Information Security Analysts,
also appears among the top 15.
Green and energy-transition roles, including
Autonomous and Electric Vehicle Specialists,
Environmental Engineers, and Renewable
Energy Engineers, also feature within the top 15
fastest-growing roles. The growth of these roles
is driven by increased efforts and investments
to reduce carbon emissions and adapt to
climate change. The growing adoption of energy
generation, storage and distribution technologies,

alongside other technology trends, are additional
contributing factors.
By contrast, respondents expect the fastestdeclining roles to include various clerical roles,
such as Cashiers and Ticket Clerks, alongside
Administrative Assistants and Executive
Secretaries, Printing Workers, and Accountants
and Auditors. Broadening digital access, AI and
information processing technologies, and robots
and autonomous systems are the primary drivers
for this decline. Aging and declining working-age
populations and slower economic growth also
contribute to the decline in clerical roles.
Figure 2.3 provides the percentage growth and
decline, alongside net growth outlook, for all roles
featured in the Future of Jobs Survey that meet
response thresholds.

To approximate the total impact of job growth
and decline, this report combines the job outlook
expectations of surveyed employers with estimates
of the total number of workers in the corresponding
roles, based on ILO employment data. However, the
Future of Jobs data set only provides information
on roles for which survey data availability meets a
minimum coverage threshold, and corresponds to
1.18 billion workers in total, which is a subset of
the ILO’s total employment data. The conclusions
derived for this subset should not be treated as
comprehensive, but rather as providing insights on
selected segments of the global workforce.
Figure 2.4 shows the 15 largest net growth and
decline job roles in absolute numbers. The highest
growth in absolute numbers of jobs is driven by
roles that make up the core of many economies.
Farmworkers top the list of the largest growing job
roles in the next five years and are expected to
see 35 million more jobs by 2030. Green transition
trends, including increased efforts and investments
to reduce carbon emissions and adapt to climate
change, are the driving forces behind this job
growth. Broadening digital access and rising cost
of living also contribute to the growth of this job
role, which currently employs more than 200 million
workers worldwide.
Delivery Drivers, Building Construction Workers,
Salespersons and Food Processing Workers are
also among the largest-growing job types in the
next five years. While technology is impacting
growth in almost all occupations, demographic
trends and economic trends also contribute to the
projected net increase in these job roles.
Care jobs, including Nursing Professionals, Social
Work and Counselling Professionals, and Personal

Care Aides are expected to see significant growth
over the next five years, driven by demographic
trends, especially aging populations. Increased
focus on labour and social issues is also identified
as a contributing factor.
Education-related roles such as University and
Higher Education Teachers and Secondary
Education Teachers are also predicted to be among
the biggest job creators in absolute terms over the
next five years globally. Broadening digital access
and growing working-age populations are the top
two contributing drivers of this job growth, while
increased focus on labour and social issues is seen
as an additional factor.
Additionally, Software and Applications Developers,
General and Operations Managers, and Project
Managers, are among the job categories driving the
most net job growth.
Conversely, in parallel to the fastest-declining job
roles, Clerical and Secretarial Workers are among
the job categories predicted to see the largest net
job decline in absolute terms (Figure 2.5).
Section 2.2 further analyses the impact of each of
the five identified labour-market macrotrends on
growing and declining jobs. However, there is also
a group of large and growing jobs that are driven by
many trends in combination. This includes Building
Framers, Finishers, and Related Trades Workers;
Light Truck or Delivery Services Drivers; Car, Van
and Motorcycle Drivers; General and Operations
Managers; and Social Work and Counselling
Professionals. For these jobs, it is the broad sweep
of transformative forces, rather than one or two
specific labour-market drivers, which is generating
growth expectations.

Technological change
Technology is predicted to be the most divergent
driver of labour-market change, with broadening
digital access expected to both create and displace
more jobs than any other macrotrend (19 million
and 9 million, respectively). Meanwhile, trends
in AI and information processing technology
are expected to create 11 million jobs, while
simultaneously displacing 9 million others, more

than any other technology trend. Robotics and
autonomous systems are expected to be the
largest net job displacer, with a net decline of 5
million jobs.
These three trends – broadening digital access,
advancements in AI and information processing,
and robotics and autonomous systems
technologies – also feature prominently as drivers
of the fastest growing and declining jobs. In fact,
Future of Jobs Report 2025

25

they are among the top drivers of growth for the 10
fastest-growing jobs: AI and information processing
technologies are among the top three drivers of
growth for all 10 of these jobs; whereas broadening
digital access is a top three driver for nine out
of these 10 (all except Autonomous and Electric
Vehicle Specialists); and robotics and autonomous
systems technologies for seven out of these 10
(all except Security Management Specialists, UI
and UX Designers, and Light Truck or Delivery
Services Drivers). In addition, of the 10 fastest- and
10 largest-declining roles, only two (Printing and
Related Trades Workers, and Building Caretakers,
Cleaners and Housekeepers) feature other trends
among their top three drivers of job decline.
By contrast, the largest-growth jobs are
influenced by a broader range of macrotrends.
The three technology-based trends stand out
as expected growth drivers only for light truck
and delivery services drivers, software and
applications developers, and nursing professionals.
This projected growth in demand for nursing
professionals is also driven by aging and declining
working-age populations, further explored in the
demographic shifts section of this chapter.

Secretaries just outside the top 10 fastest-declining

FIGURE 2.7

job roles, a first-time prediction not seen in previous
editions of the Future of Jobs Report, may illustrate
GenAI’s increasing capacity to perform knowledge
work. Job decline in both roles is seen as driven by
both AI and information processing technologies
as well as by broadening digital access. This is a
major change from the report’s 2023 edition, when
Graphic Designers were considered a moderately
growing job and Legal Secretaries did not feature in
the expected job growth/decline list.
The Shifting human-machine frontier:
automation versus augmentation
The interplay between humans, machines and
algorithms is redefining job roles across industries.
Automation is expected to drive changes in
people’s ways of working, with the proportional
share of tasks performed solely or predominantly
by humans expected to decline as technology
becomes more versatile. Future of Jobs Survey
respondents estimate that, today, 47% of work
tasks are performed mainly by humans alone, with
22% performed mainly by technology (machines
and algorithms), and 30% completed by a
combination of both. By 2030, employers expect
these proportions to be nearly evenly split across
these three categories/approaches (Figure 2.7).

Globally, the expected reduction in the proportion
of work tasks performed by humans is driven
primarily by increased automation. Of the nearly
15 percentage point reduction in the proportion
of total work tasks delivered by humans in

2030 versus 2025, nearly 82% is attributable to
advancing automation, while 19% is projected
to derive from expanded human-machine
collaboration (Figure 2.8).

Importantly, this analysis only compares the
2025 and 2030 proportions of total task delivery
attributable to human employees, technology or
collaboration between the two, respectively, and
does not consider the potential change in the
absolute amount of work tasks (output) getting
done. In other words, both machines and humans
might be significantly more productive in 2030
– performing more or higher value tasks in the
same or less amount of time than it would have
taken them to do so in 2025 – so any concern
about humans “running out of things to do” due to
automation would be misplaced.
However, a potentially more complex question
raised by these projections concerns the on-going
share of total economic value creation participated
in by human workers: If an increasing amount of
a firm’s total output and income is derived from
advanced machines and proprietary algorithms, to
what extent will human workers be able to share
in this prosperity?33 It is in this context that the
relevance of the third category/approach, humanmachine collaboration (or “augmentation”) should
be highlighted: technology could be designed
and developed in a way that complements and
enhances, rather than displaces, human work;
and, as discussed further in the next chapter (Box
3.1), talent development, reskilling and upskilling
strategies may be designed and delivered in a
way to enable and optimize human-machine
collaboration.34 It is the investment decisions and
policy choices made today that will shape these
outcomes in the coming years.35

At an industry level, while all sectors are expected
to see a reduction in the proportion of work tasks
performed by humans alone by 2030, they differ
in the share of this reduction that is projected to
be attributable to automation versus augmentation
and human-machine collaboration (Figure 2.9).
Insurance and Pensions Management and
Telecommunications are leading the automation
trend – with more than 95% of human standalone
task share reduction in both sectors expected to
derive from deeper automation. By contrast, nearly
half of the proportional reduction in work tasks done
by humans alone in the Medical and Healthcare
Services and Government and Public sectors
are instead expected to be driven by increased
augmentation and human-machine collaboration.
In four sectors – Oil and Gas, Chemicals and
Advanced Materials, Financial Services and Capital
Markets, and Electronics – automation is projected
not only to reduce the proportion of total work
tasks predominantly done today standalone by
humans, but even to reduce the share of total
work tasks currently delivered through humanmachine collaboration (resulting in calculated
“automation shares” of more than 100%, as
depicted in Figure 2.9).

Geoeconomic fragmentation

to Information Security Analysts and Security
Management Specialists.

The Future of Jobs Survey asked employers about
the impacts of three key geoeconomic trends:
increased government subsidies and industrial
policy; increased geopolitical division and conflicts;
and increased restrictions to global trade and
investment. On average, respondents expect these
trends to be net job creators. Although projected
to be three of the four lowest net job-creating
macrotrends – above only slower economic
growth – these estimates still equate to 5 million
net additional jobs by 2030, most prominently in
logistics, security and strategy roles.

The Future of Jobs Survey also asked respondents
whether they expected to offshore parts of their
workforce, or move operations closer to home
through reshoring, nearshoring, or friendshoring.
An analysis of the responses to these questions for
the subset of employers who expect geoeconomic
trends to affect their business provides insight
into how these trends affect workforce decisions.
Table 2.1 shows the share of employers who
expect each geoeconomic trend to transform
their business that additionally also expect to
offshore or re-shore significant segments of their
workforce. All three geoeconomic trends analysed
appear to drive more re-shoring, with respondents
who expect their business to be transformed
by increasing restrictions to global trade and
investment 50% more likely to plan to reshore
than the global average employer. Employers who
expect government subsidies and industrial policy
to transform their business, however, are almost as
likely to plan to offshore as they are to reshore

Increased government subsidies and industrial
policy are expected to drive increased demand
for Business Intelligence Analysts and Business
Development Professionals. Increased restrictions
to global trade and investment are also predicted
to drive growth in these roles, as well as in
Strategic Advisors and Supply Chain and Logistics
specialists. Increased geopolitical division and
conflicts, meanwhile, are projected to drive growth
in all of the aforementioned roles, in addition

Green transition
Climate change adaptation is expected to be the
third-largest contributor to net growth in global
jobs by 2030, projected to contribute an additional
5 million net jobs, while climate-change mitigation
comes in 6th with an additional 3 million net
jobs. Trends in energy generation, storage and
distribution, meanwhile, are expected to create an
additional 1 million net jobs – the second-largest
technology-based contribution to net job growth
(after trends in AI and information processing
technology).
Expectations around climate-change adaptation
and mitigation trends are pushing Environmental

BOX 2.1

Engineers and Renewable Energy Engineers into
the top 15 fastest-growing jobs, as well as driving
growth in roles such as Sustainability Specialists
and Renewable Energy Technicians. This is
corroborated by evidence that “green hiring” has
consistently outperformed overall labour-market
hiring trends in recent years (Box 2.1).
Both green transition-related macrotrends are also
expected to drive some of the largest labour-market
transformation, in absolute terms, in the global
economy. This includes being the largest drivers
of both job growth and decline in Farmworkers,
Labourers, and Other Agricultural Workers as well
as being among the strongest drivers of net job
growth for Building Framers, Finishers and Related
Trades Workers.

Green hiring rates
In collaboration with LinkedIn

LinkedIn data, generated up to July 2024 for
the Future of Jobs Report 2025, assesses the
progression of green hiring rates compared to
overall hiring rates. By comparing the share of
LinkedIn members with green skills being hired
with the overall hiring rate, it is possible to assess
differences in employment outcomes between
these two groups.

FIGURE B2.1

Figure B2.1 shows that LinkedIn members with
green skills are being hired at a significantly
higher rate than other members. Despite a dip
in green hiring throughout 2021 and early 2022,
green hiring has consistently outperformed the
overall hiring, and this outperformance has been
consistently getting larger since its low point of
May 2022.

Demographic shifts

Economic uncertainty

Growing working-age populations are the
macrotrend expected to be the second-biggest
driver of global net job creation – with 9 million
net additional jobs by 2030 – surpassed only by
broadening digital access. Aging and declining
working-age populations, meanwhile, are
simultaneously expected to be, overall, the thirdlargest driver of job creation (11 million additional
jobs) as well the primary factor in a global reduction
in 7 million jobs, making this trend the 5th largest
driver of net job creation, on balance, resulting in 4
million net additional jobs by 2030.

Slower economic growth is the only macrotrend
that Future of Jobs Survey respondents expect
to drive more job destruction (3 million jobs) than
creation (2 million jobs), while rising cost of living
and higher prices are expected to drive job creation
of 4 million jobs and displacement of 3 million jobs
by 2030.

These two demographic trends are notably among
the top three drivers of growth in roles for Assembly
and Factory Workers and Vocational Education
Teachers. Aging and declining working-age
populations also appear to drive growth in roles for
Nurses, Sales and Hospitality professionals as well
as being among the largest drivers of growth for
shop salespersons, wholesale and manufacturing
sales representatives, food and beverage serving
workers and food processing and related trades
workers. Growing working age populations,
meanwhile, are expected to be a key driver of
growth for Education roles, including University
and Higher Education Teachers and Secondary
Education Teachers.

These two trends are both significant contributors
to an expected decline in roles for Building
Caretakers, Cleaners, and Housekeepers, while
slower economic growth is also among the top
contributors to job decline in Business Services and
Administration Managers, General and Operations
Managers, and Sales and Marketing Professionals.
However, slower economic growth is also
projected to be a top driver for growth in roles
such as Business Development Professionals
and Sales Representatives. Growth in roles driven
by increasing cost of living is concentrated in
jobs associated with finding ways of increasing
efficiency, such as AI and Machine Learning
Specialists, Business Development Professionals,
and Supply Chain and Logistics Specialists.

Skills outlook
This chapter presents the results of the Future of
Jobs Survey concerning skills, as classified by the
World Economic Forum’s Global Skills Taxonomy.36
It begins by analysing respondents’ expectations
of skill disruption by 2030, as well as the skills
currently required for work and whether employers
anticipate these skills will increase or decrease in
importance over the next five years. The chapter
then assesses the skills expected to become core

skills by 2030, based on their current significance
and anticipated evolution. It also contrasts the skills
required for growing and declining jobs, revealing
windows of opportunity for enabling dynamic job
transitions. Finally, it offers an overview of the key
drivers of skill transformation and concludes with an
exploration of anticipated training needs and trends.

3.1 Expected disruptions to skills
When the Future of Jobs Report was first published
in 2016, surveyed employers expected that 35%
of workers’ skills would face disruption in the
coming years. The COVID-19 pandemic, along with
rapid advancements in frontier technologies, led
to significant disruptions in working life and skills,
prompting respondents to predict high levels of
skills instability in subsequent editions of the report.
The post-pandemic period, however, has seen
employers adapt to these changes. The accelerated
adoption of digital tools, remote work solutions, and
advanced technologies such as machine learning
and generative AI provided companies with relevant
experience to better understand the critical skills
required to navigate rapid technological change.

Despite current uncertainty around the long-term
impact of generative AI, the expected ongoing pace
of disruption of skills has begun to stabilize, albeit
at a high level. Overall, employers expect 39%
of workers’ core skills to change by 2030 (Figure
3.1). While this represents significant ongoing
skill disruption, it is down from 44% in 2023. One
element contributing to this finding may be a
growing focus on continuous learning, upskilling and
reskilling programmes, enabling companies to better
anticipate and manage future skill requirements. This
is reflected in an increasing share of the workforce
(50%) having completing training as part of long-term
learning strategies compared to 2023 (41%) – a
finding that is consistent across almost all industries.
This is discussed further in section 3.3.

economies foresee less instability (Figure 3.2).

Core skills
Figure 3.3 shows the core skills Future of Jobs
Survey respondents identify as required by workers
today. As in the two previous editions of this
report, analytical thinking remains the top core skill
for employers, with seven out of 10 companies
considering it as essential. This is followed by
resilience, flexibility and agility, along with leadership
and social influence, underscoring the critical
role of adaptability and collaboration alongside
cognitive skills. Creative thinking and motivation and
self-awareness rank fourth and fifth, respectively.
This combination of cognitive, self-efficacy and
interpersonal skills within the top five emphasizes
the importance ascribed by respondents to having
an agile, innovative and collaborative workforce,
where both problem-solving abilities and personal
resilience are critical for success.
The top 10 core skills are complemented by

technological literacy, empathy and active listening,
curiosity and lifelong learning, talent management,
and service orientation and customer service.
Skills that reflect the important role of technical
proficiency, strong interpersonal abilities, emotional
intelligence, and a commitment to continuous
learning demonstrate respondents’ expectation that
workers must balance hard and soft skills to thrive
in today’s work environments.
While the core skill sets are relatively consistent
across broader industries and geographical regions,
there are notable distinctions within specific sectors
and geographies. For instance, the Insurance
and Pensions Management industry places a
significantly higher value on curiosity and lifelong
learning, with 83% of respondents identifying it as a
core skill compared to the global average of 50%.
Resilience, flexibility and agility are also considered
as especially crucial in this sector, with 94% of
respondents emphasizing their importance versus a
global average of 67%.

The Mining and Metals industry distinguishes
itself with a strong focus on environmental
stewardship, as 50% of respondents view it as
a core skill – 2.5 times the global average. This
emphasis on environmental skills is also evident
in the Government and Public Sector, where it is
double the global average. Additionally, both the
Mining and Metals and Advanced Manufacturing
industries place higher importance on manual
dexterity, endurance and precision skills compared
to other sectors, with roughly 25% of respondents
identifying this as a core skill.

and Technology Services sector places greater
emphasis on programming skills.

The Telecommunications industry stands out
for prioritizing design and user experience,
networks and cybersecurity, and programming
skills, with twice the global average of
respondents considering these as core skills
in their organizations. Similarly, the Information

Overall, leadership and social influence, resilience,
flexibility and agility, and AI and big data have seen
the most substantial increase in importance, with
22, 17, and 17 percentage-point rises, respectively,
in the share of respondents identifying them as core
skills compared to the 2023 edition of the report.

Compared to the 2023 edition of this report,
some significant shifts in core skills have emerged.
Leadership and social influence, AI and big data,
talent management, and service orientation and
customer service have all seen marked increases
in relevance. Conversely, skills like dependability,
attention to detail, and quality control have
decreased in importance for organizations
compared to the 2023 data.

Skill evolution
According to employer expectations for the
evolution of skills in the next five years, as shown in
Figure 3.4, technological skills are projected to grow
in importance more rapidly than any other type of
skills. Among these, AI and big data top the list
as the fastest-growing skills, followed closely by
networks and cybersecurity and technological
literacy. Complementing these technological skills,
creative thinking and two socio-emotional attitudes
– resilience, flexibility, and agility, along with
curiosity and lifelong learning – are also seen as
rising in importance.

Also ranking among the top 10 skills on the rise are
leadership and social influence, talent management,
analytical thinking, and environmental stewardship.
These skills highlight the need for workers who can
lead teams, manage talent effectively and adapt to
sustainability and green transitions in an increasingly
complex and interconnected world.
At the other end of the spectrum, respondents
identified sensory-processing abilities; reading,
writing and mathematics; dependability and
attention to detail; quality control; and global
citizenship as among the most stable skills.
However, a small net decline is anticipated in
reading, writing, and mathematics. Manual

dexterity, endurance, and precision stands out
with a notable anticipated net decline, with 24%
of respondents foreseeing a decrease in its
importance. The declining relevance of physical
abilities has been a trend in previous Future of Jobs
Reports, but this is the first time it has seen a net
negative decline.
Comparisons with previous editions of the Future of
Jobs Survey reveal a notable shift in skill demands,
with technology skills such as AI and big data,
networks and cybersecurity, and environmental
stewardship showing the largest net increase in the
share of respondents identifying them as critical for
the next five years. Conversely, skills like reading,
writing, and mathematics; manual dexterity,
endurance, and precision; and dependability and
attention to detail have seen the largest decline in
projected future demand.
Figure 3.5 illustrates industry-specific variations in
the evolving importance of skills. AI and big data are
predicted to see significant growth across nearly
all sectors. In the top 10 industries, over 90% of
respondents expect this skill to increase in use. The
lowest growth shares are observed in Agriculture,
Forestry, and Fishing (70%) and Accommodation,
Food, and lLisure industries (69%). This highlights
a broad-based but uneven embrace of advanced
technological skills across industries.

Resilience, flexibility and agility are growing in
demand more quickly in the Agriculture, Forestry,
and Fishing; Telecommunications; and Information
and Technology Services sectors. The Insurance
and Pensions Management industry stands out
as the industry forecasting the fastest growth
in importance in creative thinking skills. This
industry, along with Education and Training and
Telecommunications forecast fast growth in the
importance of curiosity and lifelong learning.
Increasing skill demands in environmental
stewardship skills are particularly evident in the Oil
and Gas and Chemical and Advanced Materials
industries.
Furthermore, the net decline in the demand for
manual dexterity, endurance, and precision skills is
observed across sectors, with the most significant
decreases in Energy Technology and Utilities,
Chemicals and Advanced Materials, and Information
Technology Services, each experiencing declines
exceeding 39%. By contrast, the Accommodation,
Food, and Leisure sector and the Automotive and
Aerospace industries show the smallest declines,
with net reductions below 14%.

Core skills in 2030
Looking ahead to 2030, Figure 3.6 provides
further insights into key priority areas for workforce
development for organizations, by comparing core
and emerging skills by 2030 based on their relative
importance today and their future evolution. The top
right quadrant highlights skills that are already core
to organizations today and are expected to continue
growing rapidly. Skills such as AI and big data;
analytical thinking; creative thinking; resilience,
flexibility and agility; and technological literacy
are not only considered critical now but are
also projected to become even more important.
Moreover, leadership and social influence,

curiosity and lifelong learning, systems thinking,
talent management, and motivation and selfawareness solidify their importance, emphasizing
the continued relevance of human-centric skills
amid rapid technological advances.
Meanwhile, networks and cybersecurity and
environmental stewardship – in the top left
quadrant of the figure – rank among the top 10
skills expected to increase significantly in use by
2030, yet they are not currently considered core
skills for most organizations. These emerging
skills represent areas where businesses may
need to anticipate growing demands and develop
capabilities before they become critical.

expertise required for each skill in growing jobs
compared to declining jobs. For example, a score of
2 in either metric means a skill is twice as critical or
requires double the proficiency in growing roles.

While a diverse set of skills is essential for
navigating the evolving workforce landscape,
contrasting the skills requirements particularly
associated with growing jobs, and those associated
with declining ones, reveals windows of opportunity
that exist for enabling dynamic job transitions.37,38

World Economy Forum analysis, based on Future of Jobs Survey
2024, the World Economic Forum’s Global Skills Taxonomy and
O*NET skill importance and level for each occupation.

Bold lines represent the average across all skills.

At an aggregate level across all growing and
declining roles, resilience, flexibility and agility skills
are the most significant differentiator between
growing and declining job roles, ranking higher
in both importance and proficiency for growing
roles. Programming and technological literacy also
differentiates growing and declining roles, reflecting
the increasing integration of technology across
occupational fields. While programming scores
higher in importance, it requires less proficiency
compared to technological literacy.
Resource management and operations, and
quality control skills also show marked gaps
in both proficiency and importance. Analytical
thinking completes the list of top five skills for the
importance gap, while ranking 6th for the skill
proficiency gap.
Manual dexterity, endurance, and precision display
a notable difference in proficiency requirements

rather than importance. This suggests that in roles
in which manual skills remain critical, businesses
are seeking a higher degree of specialization that
combines manual abilities with technological
literacy, and problem-solving skills. Growing roles
demanding high manual skill proficiency include
Drafters, Engineering and Mapping Technicians,
Electrotechnology Engineers, Mechanics, Machinery
Repairers, and Solar Energy Installation Engineers.
By contrast, declining roles, such as printing trades
workers and transportation attendants, generally
require lower levels of manual skill proficiency.
Notably, the only skill with an equal or lesser
requirement in importance or proficiency for growing
jobs is service orientation and customer service.
These findings underscore the importance of
targeted skills development efforts to support
workers in transitioning to growing roles as well as
to ensure employers can access a talent pool with
the skills required for the future of work.

3.2 Drivers of skill disruption
This section discusses how each of the five
identified macrotrends driving labour-market
transformation – technological change,
geoeconomic fragmentation, green transition,
demographic shifts and economic uncertainty – are
expected to influence skill evolution by 2030.

Technological change
Technological advances are expected to drive
skills change more than any other trend over the
next five years. The increasing importance of AI
and big data, networks and cybersecurity, and
technological literacy is driven by the expansion
of digital access and the integration of AI and
information processing technologies. These trends
are not only seen as responsible for the growth of
these three fastest-growing skills but also for the
rising importance of analytical thinking and systems
thinking. These shifts highlight the increasing
complexity of decision-making and the need for
critical problem solving in a data-driven world.
Beyond the top 10 fastest-growing skills, design
and user experience, along with marketing and
media skills, are also expected to see growth driven
by technological advancements. These skills are
closely linked to digital transformation, reflecting
the rising importance of delivering seamless digital
experiences and understanding the impact of
consumer behaviour.
Robots and autonomous systems are also seen
as a key driver of skills change, contributing to
the increased demand for not only the three
top-growing skills, but also programming and
systems thinking – skills essential for managing
and optimizing interactions with autonomous
technology. As noted in Chapter 2, robots and
autonomous systems are also among the primary
drivers behind the fastest-growing jobs. Coupled
with the rising demand for the three top growing

BOX 3.1

skills, and programming, this trend underscores the
importance of technological expertise and systems
thinking as core skills in technical fields. These
capabilities are crucial for enabling employees
to adapt to, and collaborate effectively with,
automated systems across a range of industries.
While technology fuels demand for certain skills, it
also accelerates the decline of others. Skills such
as manual dexterity, endurance, precision, and
reading, writing, and mathematics are expected
to diminish in relevance as digital access, AI and
information processing, and robotics increasingly
automate these tasks. Interestingly, whereas
programming remains stable as an in-demand
skill, both respondents expecting growth in its use
and those expecting decline consistently point to
technological change as the primary driver behind
this change. As discussed in more depth in Chapter
2, this highlights the dual effect of technology,
underscoring how the same technological forces
that drive job creation may also contribute to job
displacement. Additionally, as also discussed in
Chapter 2, the primary impact of technologies
such as GenAI on skills may lie in their potential for
“augmenting” human skills through human-machine
collaboration, rather than in outright replacement,
particularly given the continued importance of
human-centred skills (Box 3.1).
These findings underscore an urgent need for
appropriate reskilling and upskilling strategies to
bridge emerging divides. Such strategies will be
essential in helping workers transition to roles that
blend technical expertise with human-centred
capabilities, supporting a more adaptable workforce
in an increasingly technology-driven landscape.

Generative AI and human-centred skills
In collaboration with Indeed

The release of ChatGPT 3.5 in November 2022
marked an inflection point in public awareness
of GenAI technologies, which sparked both
excitement and apprehension regarding their
potential impact on the workforce.40 In this
context, research conducted by Indeed for this
report highlights the continued importance of
human-centred skills in an age of GenAI. Figure
B3.1 illustrates the capacity of GenAI to substitute
a human in executing specific skills, based on an
assessment by GPT-4o of its own ability to utilize
skills across three areas: its ability to provide
theoretical knowledge about a given skill, its

problem-solving abilities related to that skill, and
the need for physical presence or manual actions
in performing that skill.41 The chart categorizes
more than 2,800 granular skills into the World
Economic Forum’s Global Skills Taxonomy and
evaluates their capacity of substitution by GenAI
according to five categories: very low capacity,
low capacity, moderate capacity, high capacity,
and very high capacity.
Zero of the more than 2,800 skills assessed were
determined to exhibit “very high capacity” to
be replaced by the current generation of GenAI

Future of Jobs Report 2025

43

tools, with the majority of examined skills (69%)
determined to have either “very low capacity” or
“low capacity” to be substituted, indicating that
GenAI currently remains limited in performing
tasks that require physical execution, nuanced
judgment or hands-on application. Skills rooted
in human interaction – including empathy and
active listening, and sensory processing abilities
– and manual dexterity, endurance and precision,
currently show no substitution potential due to
their physical and deeply human components.
These findings underscore the practical limitations
of current GenAI models, which lack the
physicality to perform tasks that require hands-on
interaction – although advances in robotics and
the integration of GenAI into robotic systems could
impact this in the future.
Where GenAI demonstrates higher substitution
potential is in skills that can be effectively
performed by leveraging theoretical knowledge
alongside digital manipulation. These include
granular skills within AI and big data, such as
data mining and machine learning applications.

FIGURE B3.1

Furthermore, GenAI shows strengths in reading,
writing, and mathematics, and multi-lingualism,
where it can assist in summarizing complex
information, drafting text, performing calculations,
and translation. Notably, more than one-quarter
(28.5%) of the more than 2,800 granular skills
examined currently exhibit a moderate capacity
of substitution, highlighting areas where, as the
technology continues to evolve, its capacity of
substitution could increase in the near future.
These findings highlight the potential of GenAI for
augmenting human work through human-machine
collaboration, rather than fully replacing it in most
areas. Skills requiring nuanced understanding,
complex problem-solving or sensory processing
show limited current risk of replacement by GenAI,
affirming that human oversight remains crucial
even in areas where GenAI can provide assistance.
For employers, these insights emphasize the need
for training and upskilling initiatives that focus on
both advanced prompt-writing skills and broader
GenAI literacy.

Geoeconomic fragmentation and
economic uncertainty

to the Future of Jobs Survey is not only evident in
skill requirements but also appears as a significant
factor in net job growth by 2030.

The Future of Jobs Survey also examined the
impact of geoeconomic trends on skill evolution.
Increasing geoeconomic fragmentation, coupled
with the rapid adoption of new technologies and
expansion of digital access, has significantly
increased cybersecurity concerns.42 These
geoeconomic trends have led to a surge in
demand for network and cybersecurity skills as
organizations seek to protect digital infrastructure
from emerging threats.

While demand for global citizenship skills is
expected by most respondents to remain stable
over the next five years, employers that anticipate
a rise in its importance cite the convergence
of climate-change adaptation, geoeconomic
fragmentation and broadening digital access
as key factors. This highlights the growing
interconnectedness of sustainability and global
collaboration, particularly as businesses operate
in increasingly fragmented and climate-sensitive
environments.

Geoeconomic fragmentation is also driving a
need for human-centred skills such as resilience,
flexibility, agility, leadership and social influence,
and global citizenship. In a world where crises are
becoming more frequent, employers need leaders
and teams capable of adapting to uncertainty and
managing complex social dynamics.

Demographic shifts

Green transition

Ongoing demographic shifts, particularly aging
and declining workforces in developed economies,
are expected to emerge as a significant driver of
skill demand. Aging and declining working-age
populations are pressing organizations to prioritize
talent management, teaching and mentoring
and motivation and self-awareness. Alongside
these priorities, there is a rising focus on empathy
and active listening, resource management, and
customer service, highlighting a growing need for
interpersonal and operational skills that can address
the specific needs of an aging workforce and foster
more inclusive work environments.

A growing focus on environmental stewardship as a
critical skill reflects an evolving alignment between
business strategies and sustainability objectives.
This rise, driven by climate adaptation efforts,
carbon reduction initiatives, and energy generation,
storage and distribution technologies, points to
a profound shift whereby environmental skills are
becoming increasingly integral across diverse
sectors. As previously shown in Chapter 2 and Box
2.1, an increasing prioritization of climate adaptation
and energy solutions by employers responding

Increasing demand for talent management and
motivation and self-awareness skills is also driven
by growing working-age populations. Findings
reported in Chapter 2 underscore similar patterns,
where aging and growing working-age populations
are major drivers of growth in jobs across
Education, Sales, and Hospitality. These trends
reveal the dual role demographic changes play in
shaping both job availability and the types of skills
needed, emphasizing the interconnectedness of
workforce demographics with skills development
and talent strategies across sectors.

Slower economic growth and increased restrictions
to global trade are contributing to the increased
importance of creative thinking and resilience,
flexibility, and agility. These skills are crucial for
navigating uncertain economic landscapes,
as businesses seek to innovate and remain
competitive despite market constraints.

3.3 Reskilling and upskilling strategies
Having anticipated significant skill disruptions,
employers have increasingly invested in reskilling
and upskilling initiatives to align workforce skills with
evolving demands (see Section 3.1).
This section explores training trends, how
employers expect to finance their training
initiatives, and their expectations regarding the
outcomes of these investments.

Training needs
Future of Jobs Survey respondents indicate that

50% of their workforce has completed training as
part of their learning and development initiatives.
This reflects a positive global trend compared
to 2023, when only 41% of the workforce had
received training. The rise in training completion
is evident across nearly all industries (Figure 3.8),
suggesting a growing recognition of the importance
of continuous skill development.
However, a few industries stand out from this trend.
Agriculture, Forestry and Fishing, and Real Estate
are the only sectors that have seen a decline in
training completion between the two last editions
of this report. On the other hand, industries like

have seen the most significant rise in the share of
workers completing training.
Looking ahead, Figure 3.9 provides an overview
of expectations around workforce training needs
by 2030. According to surveyed employers, for a
representative sample of 100 workers 41 will not
require significant training by 2030; 11 will require
training, but it will not be accessible to them in the
foreseeable future; and 29 will require training and
be upskilled within their current roles. Additionally,
employers anticipate that 19 out of 100 workers will
require training and will be reskilled and redeployed
within their organization by 2030.
The anticipated need for training varies significantly
across industries and geographies. While
companies headquartered in North America
estimate that 67% of their workforce will require
training by 2030, those in Central Asia and the

FIGURE 3.9

Middle East and North Africa project that under
50% of their workforce will need training by 2030.
Industries, such as Telecommunications, and
Information and Technology Services, which
saw some of the largest uptake in reskilling and
upskilling (Figure 3.8), still anticipate significant
training needs, with 63% and 62% of their
workforce, respectively, expected to need further
training by 2030. By contrast, sectors with declining
trendlines in training completion are among the
sectors with the lowest projected additional training
needs.
The share of employees estimated as unlikely to
receive upskilling opportunities is somewhat uniform
across industries and geographies, suggesting
that while the demand for skills may vary, access
to reskilling and upskilling opportunities remains
similarly constrained globally.

Funding for training programmes
When it comes to funding of reskilling and upskilling
initiatives, employers predominantly expect to
fund their own training programmes, as shown in
Figure 3.10. The second-most common funding
mechanism is free of cost training, followed by
government and public-private funding.
With funding for reskilling and upskilling being the
most-welcomed public-policy support by Future
of Jobs Survey respondents, government funding
plays a more significant role in industries such as
Accommodation, Food, and Leisure; Government

and Public Sector; and Education and Training,
where over 30% of companies expect to rely on
public financing for training initiatives. On the other
hand, only 3% of companies in the Insurance and
Pensions Management industry expect to rely on
government funding for training.
While co-funding across industries is the least
utilized funding model overall, it is expected to
have the largest use in industries such as Care,
Personal Services and Wellbeing; Agriculture,
Forestry, and Fishing; and Automotive and
Aerospace. This highlights the importance of cross
industry collaboration in these industries.

Workforce strategies
This chapter discusses workforce strategies that
employers anticipate adopting in response to the
macrotrends shaping the future of work and key
barriers to organizational transformation. It also
analyses employers’ outlook on talent availability

from now to 2030, and explores planned workplace
practices and policies to achieve their organization’s
business goals, with a particular focus on the
shifting relationship between humans and
technologies.

4.1 Barriers to transformation
Skill gaps in the labour market are the primary
barrier to business transformation perceived by
Future of Jobs Survey respondents for the 20252030 period, cited by 63% of surveyed employers
(Figure 4.1). This is even more pronounced than
the results described in the 2023 edition of the

FIGURE 4.1

report, where skills gaps in the local labour market
also topped the transformation barriers, backed
by 60% of executives. This skill challenge persists
across almost all industries and geographies,
ranking first in 52 out of 55 economies and 19 out
of 22 sectors.

The second most significant perceived barrier
is organizational culture and resistance to
change, identified by 46% of respondents as a
key obstacle, which highlights the anticipated
challenge of aligning internal processes,
organizational structures, hierarchies and mindsets
in responding to the trends and disruptions
companies expect to face. Regulatory concerns

are considered the third most relevant barrier,
identified by 39% of employers. Moreover, 32% of
respondents highlight a lack of adequate data and
technical infrastructure as an additional obstacle.
Other barriers, such as shortage of investment
capital (26%) and insufficient understanding of
opportunities (25%), are cited less frequently.

Future of Jobs Report 2025

In the report’s 2023 edition, more than half of
respondents identified difficulties in attracting talent
as a primary barrier. This year’s survey distinguishes
between industry attractiveness and firm-level
attractiveness, and results show that 37% of
companies view lack of industry attractiveness as a
notable barrier, while 27% cite firm-specific issues.

Talent availability outlook
Employers’ outlook on talent availability has
decreased compared to the results highlighted in
the report’s 2023 edition. This year, only 29% of
businesses expect talent availability to improve
over the 2025-2030 period, a drop from 39% in
2023. By contrast, 42% of employers expect talent
availability to decline over this period, resulting
in a net negative talent availability outlook (-13%

FIGURE 4.2

net expectation of improvement) and highlighting
increasing concern among businesses regarding
their ability to find the right future talent (Figure 4.2).
However, employers remain more broadly optimistic
about the outlook for talent development. Seven
in 10 respondents expect improvements in talent
development within their organization by 2030.
However, as noted in the report’s 2023 edition,
77% of businesses expressed a positive view on
the outlook for talent development, suggesting
that some companies are re-evaluating their
expectations.
With regard to talent retention, employers are
similarly less positive than in the report’s previous
edition: Only 44% of surveyed organizations expect
improvements in their ability to retain talent, a
decline from 53% two years ago.

Country-specific variations in talent availability
outlook, as shown for hiring in Figure 4.3, reflect
broader demographic dynamics. For example, in
the Middle East and North Africa, employers in
countries such as Egypt (+39% net expectation
of improvement), Morocco (+38%), and Bahrain
(+31%) display high levels of optimism about
talent availability, with the majority of respondents
expecting hiring conditions to improve by 2030.
By contrast, employers in European economies
anticipate increasing challenges in hiring availability.

As for talent retention, employers in high-income
and upper-middle-income economies express
greater concern compared to their counterparts in
lower-middle-income economies.

Expectations around talent development shows
significant regional variation. For example,
companies headquartered in Eastern Asia, SubSaharan Africa, and Central Asia generally report
high levels of optimism for the next five years. By
contrast, businesses headquartered in Europe,
the Middle East and Northern Africa, and Northern
America are more cautious than global averages
with regard to their expectations.

Workforce strategy
Upskilling the workforce emerges as the most
common workforce strategy in response to
macrotrends, over the 2025-2030 period, with
85% of surveyed employers anticipating adopting
this approach (Figure 4.4). Upskilling is identified
as a top 3 priority across all geographies, and
economies at all income levels, with employers in
high-income economies (87%) slightly ahead of
those in upper-middle-income (84%) and lowermiddle-income (82%) ones.
Process and task automation is expected to be
the second most common workforce strategy,
with 73% of employers planning to accelerate
their use of this approach – down from 80% as

noted in the report’s 2023 edition. Additionally,
63% of employers intend to complement and
augment their workforce with new technologies.
Automation is a more pronounced strategy in
high-income economies (77%), compared to
upper-middle-income (74%) and lower-middleincome economies (57%).
Regarding adjusting the composition of their
workforce, 70% of organizations surveyed plan to
hire new staff with emerging in-demand skills, 51%
intend to transition staff from declining to growing
roles internally, while 41% foresee staff reductions
due to skills obsolescence. A slightly higher share
of employers plan to move operations within
closer control through reshoring, nearshoring
or friendshoring (10%) than those who plan to
offshore significant parts of their workforce (8%).

4.2 Improving talent availability
Business practices
The importance of supporting employee health
and well-being has newly emerged as a top priority
to increase talent availability over the 2025-2030
period. As shown in Figure 4.5, 64% of employers
now see promise in this approach, a marked rise
from 9th place in the 2023 edition of this report to
1st this year. In fact, this newfound emphasis on
this practice holds importance across industries,
ranking first in eight sectors and consistently within
the top four across all others. In the Insurance and
Pensions Management sector, 85% of companies
expect this practice to improve talent availability.

The Accommodation, Food, and Leisure, and
Education and Training sectors witnessed the
largest jump in prioritizing employee well-being
between 2023 and 2025.
Additional business practices identified as promising
to increase talent availability include providing
effective reskilling and upskilling opportunities43,
highlighted by 63% of organizations, this is
particularly evident in the Government and Public
sector, where four out of five respondents expect
such measures to grow their talent base. Following
closely behind, improving talent progression and
promotion, previously ranked highest in the 2023
edition, remains a key focus for 62% of surveyed
organizations. Higher wages are identified as a

priority by 50% of respondents, with particular
significance in the Education and Training sector,
where 61% of employers emphasize this measure.
Tapping into diverse talent pools continues to
increase in importance, with almost half of surveyed
employers (47%) now emphasizing the potential of
this strategy – a substantial increase from just over
10% in the report’s 2023 edition. These findings
highlight the potential of skills-first approaches
in identifying and attracting talent based on skills
rather than traditional credentials.44 In line with this,
employers also show increased interest in offering
flexibility measures, such as enabling remote work

BOX 4.1

across national borders (27%) and supporting
workers with caregiving responsibilities (26%).
By contrast, articulating business purpose and
impact has seen a decline in emphasis, dropping
from 4th place in the report’s 2023 edition, with
37% of employers highlighting the promise of this
measure.

Talent availability: an employee perspective
In collaboration with ADP Research

To complement the Future of Jobs Survey’s
focus on employer perspectives on talent
availability, collaboration for this report with
ADP Research has produced a data set that
provides the employee perspective, aiming to
understand the key factors and priorities that
would make workers want to stay in a job. The
resulting analysis reveals both convergences and
divergences in priorities for talent attraction and
retention (Figure B4.1).

Where employees’ reasons to stay and employers’
practices align include: improving talent
progression and promotion processes (employer
rank 3rd vs. employee rank 2nd), offering higher
wages (employer rank 4th vs. employee rank 3rd),
and providing remote or hybrid work opportunities
(employer 6th vs. employee 4th).
The findings also highlight areas of misalignment
between employee and employer expectations.
The divergence is most pronounced around

and reskilling, which are viewed as essential by
employers, but less so by employees, who rank
them 8th and 7th, respectively. By contrast,
employees place higher value on working hours,
which tops the list of desired policies, while
employers rank this measure the eighth most
effective strategy to boost talent availability; and

Note
In the ADP Research survey, the question is framed as follows: From the following list, which are
the top three (perks) reasons you stay with your current employer? The options were matched
with the list of business practices to boost talent availability in the Future of Jobs Survey.

Public policies
Globally, when asked about the public-policy
interventions with the highest perceived potential
to increase access to talent over the 2025-2030
period, employers identified funding for reskilling
and upskilling (55%) and provision of reskilling and
upskilling (52%) as the two most crucial policy
measures (Figure 4.6). This points to businesses’
desire for sustained public investment in skills
development to align workforce capabilities with
future labour-market demands.
Improving public education systems has risen in
perceived priority and now ranks 3rd, with 47%
of respondents highlighting this policy measure,
up from 4th in the report’s 2023 edition. In Israel,
Kazakhstan and the Philippines, public education
system improvements saw the largest increase
in priority as a public policy measure to enhance
talent availability, rising seven, six, and six places,
respectively, compared to 2023. Simultaneously,

wage-setting flexibility has moved to 5th place
globally, up from 6th in 2023, with 38% of
respondents highlighting this policy measure.
Wage subsidies saw the biggest decline in
perceived importance, moving from 3rd in 2023 to
8th in this year’s edition, with 26% of respondents
pointing to it as a critical policy tool. Flexibility in
hiring and firing practices, ranked 4th, has declined
two places since 2023, now highlighted by 44% of
employers. Despite the overall decline in emphasis
on this measure, wage subsidies remain the top
highlighted policy in Türkiye and Morocco, while
hiring and firing flexibility is the most emphasized
priority in eleven countries, including Australia,
Brazil, Republic of Korea and Singapore.
In light of demographic shifts, companies are
increasingly exploring policy interventions aimed
at broadening the talent pool. Changes to labour
laws related to remote work are highlighted as a
priority by 36% of employers, with strong demand
in particular from companies headquartered in

Sub-Saharan Africa, as well as, from an industry
perspective, in the finance industry (both Financial
Services and Capital markets and Insurance and
Pensions Management). Changes to immigration
laws (26%) are less emphasized, with the exception
of industries such as Production of Consumer
Goods; Accommodation, Food, and Leisure; and
Electronics. Meanwhile, a quarter of respondents

FIGURE 4.6

(25%) highlight changes to pension schemes
and retirement ages. Companies headquartered
in Eastern Asia, where the effect of ageing
workforces is currently more pronounced, favour
this public policy. By contrast, few organizations
headquartered in regions with younger populations,
such as Sub-Saharan Africa and Southern Asia, see
the potential of such policy intervention.

Diversity, equity and inclusion
Globally, the Future of Jobs Survey finds increased
emphasis by employers on diversity, equity and
inclusion in the workplace, connected to a growing
perception of its potential to increase talent
availability. Tapping into diverse talent pools is
now considered among the top 5 most impactful
business practices to increase talent availability,
compared to its 11th place ranking in the report’s
2023 edition.
Eighty-three percent of surveyed employers
have implemented diversity, equity and inclusion
measures, an increase from 67% in 2023.
This trend is especially strong among larger
organizations, where nearly all companies with over
50,000 employees (95%) and those headquartered
in Northern America (96%) report having such
measures in place. By contrast, companies
headquartered in lower-middle-income economies
(75%) and smaller organizations (73%) are less
likely to implement diversity, equity and inclusion
measures.

common such programme element anticipated
to be implemented by organizations in the next
five years. This is closely followed by targeted
recruitment, retention and progression initiatives
(48%), with diversity, equity and inclusion goals,
targets and quotas (42%) experiencing the fastest
growth in anticipated adoption. In the report’s
2023 edition, only one-quarter of companies had
planned to adopt such targets (Figure 4.8). Pay
equity reviews and salary audits, anti-harassment
protocols and support for workers with caregiving
responsibilities are also increasingly highlighted,
with 39%, 33% and 26% of companies,
respectively, planning to adopt these measures.
Hiring diversity, equity and inclusion officers and
supporting employee resource groups (ERGs) are
less commonly mentioned, adopted by 15% and
22% of surveyed organizations, respectively.

In terms of employee demographics, women
are considered the highest priority group for
surveyed employers’ diversity, equity and inclusion
programmes worldwide, with 76% of respondents
anticipating a focus of their measures on this group
(Figure 4.9). Workers with disabilities (56%) and
‘Gen Z’ youth (those under the age of 25) (52%)
are the second- and third most considered groups.
Older workers (those over the age of 55) and those
identifying as LGBTQI+ are anticipated to be a

focus for 42% and 33% of surveyed employers,
respectively. Finally, 27% of respondents anticipate
a focus on individuals from disadvantaged religious,
ethnic, or racial backgrounds. This represents a
decline from the report’s 2023 edition, when nearly
two-fifths of employers expected to be focusing
on individuals from these groups. Workers from
low-income backgrounds (24%) and migrants,

as technological change, demographic shifts
and economic uncertainty, wage dynamics have
become an increasingly important factor for

FIGURE 4.10

understanding the shape of future labour markets.
As revealed by the Future of Jobs Survey, more
than half (52%) of employers globally expect to see
an increase in the share of their revenue allocated
to wages over the 2025-2030 period, 41% of
surveyed employers anticipate their current wage
allocation to remain stable, while 7% foresee a
reduction by 2030 (Figure 4.10).

Smaller companies exhibit higher expectations
regarding growth of wages as a share of total
revenues, with 57% of employers with fewer than
1,000 employees anticipating an increase in wage
share. By contrast, only 45% of employers with
10,000–50,000 employees and 47% of those with
over 50,000 employees expect to see the same.
In shaping wage and compensation policies, two
factors stand out globally: workers’ productivity and
performance (cited by 77% of respondents) and
competing to retain talent (cited by 71%) (Figure

4.11). Sector-wise, only six industries expect an
emphasis on competition for talent over productivity
and performance as a factor in their wage
considerations: Electronics, Insurance and Pensions
Management, Professional Services, Real Estate,
Medical and Healthcare Services, and Government
and Public Sector. All other industries anticipate
a focus on productivity as the more crucial factor
when designing wage strategies over the 20252030 period.

BOX 4.2

Wage premium for skills and experience
In collaboration with ADP Research

Given shifting global workforce dynamics, how are
differences in education, training and experience
reflected in wages? Analysis conducted by ADP
Research for the Future of Jobs Report 2025
addresses this question by analysing monthly
wage data of workers in the United States
according to Occupation Information Network
(O*NET) job zones. The O*NET data assigns
all occupations to job zones, from entry-level
positions needing minimal preparation (Job
zone 1) to highly specialized roles with extensive
preparation, usually demanding graduate
school education and extensive job training and
work experience (Job zone 5). The research
analyses wages at each job zone to calculate
a wage premium from one level of workforce
preparedness to another.
Workers’ median and mean wages increase as
the job zone level increases (Figure B4.2A). On
average, the median wage is 37% higher for each
job zone level (Figure B4.2B). The highest gap
between levels is 48%, which is the difference in
median wage between job zone 3, where workers

such as Security Guards and Dental Laboratory
Technicians usually receive vocational training
or an associate degree, and job zone 4, where
workers have considerable preparation for the job.
The lowest median wage premium gap is 27%,
between job zone 4 and job zone 5, which is
made up of primarily specialized roles that require
extensive training, such as Pharmacists, Lawyers
and Biologists.
The mean wage premium is higher, averaging
58% per job zone level, with the marginal premium
spiking the jump from jobs requiring considerable
preparation, such as Real Estate Brokers and
Sales Managers, to specialized roles with
extensive preparation, the highest level.
The gap between the median and mean wage
premium – the two curves in Figures B4.2A and
B – indicates that there exists a wide pay range
within the same job zone, and that wider pay
ranges are more prevalent for workers in more
specialized roles.

Assessing the wage premium for skills through a
gender lens reveals that men tend to have a higher
wage premium across all zone transitions except
one. Men, on average, experience a 44% wage
premium between job zones, whereas women see
a 30% premium (Figure B4.3).
Gender disparities are most pronounced at
specific transitions. While male workers receive a
wage premium of 39% at the point of transition

FIGURE B4.3

from jobs that require little preparation to jobs
that require some preparation, the equivalent
wage premium for female workers is only 19%.
At the upper end of the job complexity spectrum,
women only receive a 15% higher wage for
working in specialized jobs that require extensive
preparation compared to jobs that require
considerable preparation. This contrasts sharply
with a 44% higher median wage at this transition
point for men.

Approaches to skills assessment
Removing academic degree requirements and
conducting skill-based hiring is an increasingly
recognized approach to expanding talent
availability.45 As shown in Figure 4.12, work
experience continues to be the most common
assessment mechanism in hiring processes, with
81% of businesses expecting to continue to rely on
it over the 2025-2030 period. This is consistent with
previous editions of the report, underlining the value
employers place on practical, on-the-job learning
and achievements. Only 4% of companies report
that they do not assess the skills of prospective
employees, highlighting that skills evaluation is
almost universal across industries.
The second most common method of evaluation is
skills assessments, expected to be utilized by 48%
of employers, highlighting a growing emphasis on
directly testing candidates’ competencies rather
than relying solely on their resumes. In addition,

psychometric tests are planned to be used by 34%
of businesses, reflecting an increased focus on
evaluating candidates’ behavioural traits, cognitive
abilities and cultural fit.
The requirement of a university degree features
in third place of employers’ approaches to skills
assessment, with 43% of respondents expecting to
continue to use degrees as a requirement by 2030.
Comparison with the previous edition of this report
shows that employers are increasingly focusing on
work experience and psychometric testing over
traditional credentials like university degrees. This
shift signals a growing recognition that practical
skills and cognitive abilities may be more indicative
of future job performance than formal educational
qualifications, in addition to expanding the
talent pool. O*NET’s database of job experience
requirements reveals that 14 of the 15 fastestgrowing jobs over 2025 to 2030 primarily require
a university degree, while only seven of the 15
largest-growing roles demand an advanced degree.
This reliance on traditional credentials in rapidly
Future of Jobs Report 2025

61

expanding roles could exacerbate talent shortages.
Adopting a skills-first approach can broaden talent
pools and strengthen talent pipelines for these
future roles.46 Moreover, the diverse requirements
of the largest-growing jobs highlight the critical role
of occupations that are often accessible through
vocational training, apprenticeships, on-the-job
experience, or associate degrees.

report’s 2023 edition: 17% of employers anticipate
prioritizing apprenticeships while 14% plan to
consider online certificates in their hiring decisions.

However, the expected use of apprenticeships,
short courses and online certificates in skills
assessment has seen a slight decline since the

Workforce strategies in response
to AI adoption
The Future of Jobs Survey finds that 86% of
employers expect AI and information processing
technologies to transform their business by
2030. In the Financial Services (97%) and
Electronics (95%) sectors, anticipated AI exposure
is notably higher than the global average. By
contrast, employers in sectors such as Energy
Technology and Utilities (72%) and Government
and Public Sector (76%) expect lower exposure
to AI disruption by 2030. Larger organizations
are considering it more likely that their business
model will be transformed by AI: only 6% of
companies with over 50,000 employees expect
low AI exposure by 2030, compared to 16% of
companies with fewer than 1,000 employees and
15% of those with 1,000-5,000 employees.
Complementing the Future of Jobs Survey, the
World Economic Forum’s Executive Opinion Survey
captures insights from more than 11,000 executives

worldwide. Regarding barriers to AI adoption,
as presented in Figure 4.13, half of executives
worldwide highlight a lack of skills to support
adoption as the top barrier. This is closely followed
by a lack of vision among managers and leaders
(43%). Other obstacles include high costs of AI
products and services (29%), lack of customization
to local business needs (24%), complex regulations
around AI and data usage (21%), and limited
consumer demand (16%). Overall, these results
point to a persistent gap in skills required for AI
adoption, both for managers and workers.
In response to expected AI disruption, reskilling
and upskilling of the existing workforce to work
more effectively alongside AI emerges as the most
anticipated workforce strategy for companies
headquartered in 45 out of the 55 economies
covered by the report. By 2030, 77% of surveyed
employers plan to implement this strategy (Figure
4.14).
In addition, 69% of respondents plan to recruit
talent skilled in AI tool design and enhancement,

and 62% anticipate focusing on hiring
individuals with skills to work with AI. Almost
half of organizations are expecting to reorient
their business models toward new AI-driven
opportunities (49%), while 47% plan to transition

employees from AI-disrupted roles to other
positions. While most employers plan to hire new
people with AI relevant skills, a significant share
(41%) also expect to downsize their workforce as AI

Relative AI job and skill concentration, by industry
In collaboration with LinkedIn

Analysis conducted by LinkedIn for the Future
of Jobs Report 2025 assesses the relative AI
job and skill concentration for 10 industries.
This data is calculated by assessing the number
of AI occupations and the number of LinkedIn
members with at least two reported AI-related
skills for each industry. As shown in Figure B4.4,
to enable industry comparisons, each sector’s
AI concentration is benchmarked against the
2016 value of the industry with the highest AI
concentration in 2016 (Education).

FIGURE B4.4

This analysis helps illustrate which industries
have seen the greatest AI uptake, in terms of AIrelated jobs and skills as well as AI concentration
trends over time. While AI concentration has at
least doubled across nearly all industries since
2016, the relative ranking of industries has stayed
largely stable. Over the last five years, the order
of industries with the highest AI concentration has
remained unchanged.

Region, economy and
industry insights
The impact of macrotrends on labour markets over
the 2025-2030 period will have both common and
sector- and region/economy-specific characteristics
across industries and geographies around the
world. This chapter highlights key findings from
the Future of Jobs Survey as they relate to the
expected jobs landscape, anticipated skills needs
and planned workforce strategies of employers at
regional, economy and industry levels – and offers
insights into how businesses in specific economies

and sectors are navigating these transformations.
In addition to the insights presented in this chapter,
Part 2 of the report provides detailed region,
economy and industry profiles for all geographies
and sectors featured in the report, and the
corresponding data may also be accessed online,
via an interactive data explorer tool, at:
https://www.weforum.org/publications/the-futureofjobs-report-2025/future-of-jobs-data-explorer-2025.

5.1 Region and economy insights
Eastern Asia and Oceania
Companies headquartered in Eastern Asia expect
aging and declining working-age populations
and slower economic growth to transform the
region’s labour markets by 2030. Organizational
culture and resistance to change are perceived as
a significant barrier to business transformation by
64% of employers in the region, above the global
average of 46%. Industry talent shortages are
likewise seen as a key barrier to transformation by
53% of companies. To address these challenges,
businesses operating in China and Republic of
Korea are investing in technologies to automate and
augment their workforce, while those operating in
Japan and Hong Kong SAR, China, are increasingly
tapping into diverse talent pools.
Over the next five years, more than half of
companies operating in China expect geoeconomic
fragmentation and increased efforts in climate
mitigation to shape their businesses, above a
global average of 34% and 47%, respectively. More
than 90% of employers identify AI and robotics as
key technologies to transform their organization,
while 43% identify new materials and 19% identify
biotechnology, a higher share than their global
peers (30% and 11%, respectively). Industry talent
shortages are highlighted by 38% of businesses
operating in the country. According to more
than half of employers, government’s funding for
reskilling and upskilling and increased flexibility
on hiring and firing practices could contribute to

increase talent availability, while only 9% expect
to see benefits from increased public support for
caregivers.
In Hong Kong SAR, China, 60% of businesses
include increased focus on labour and social issues
among the top trends impacting their organization,
which is significantly higher than the global average
of 46%. This is followed by broadening digital
access (60%) and increased climate-mitigation
efforts (56%). Technology is seen as central to
workforce planning, with 76% of companies aiming
to augment their workforce using new technologies.
Businesses operating in Hong Kong SAR, China
expect 43% of tasks to be completed primarily by
technology by 2030, surpassing the global estimate
of 34%. Efforts to broaden hiring are evident, as
76% of employers plan to tap into diverse talent
pools, compared to 47% globally. Moreover, 82%
of businesses are planning to implement targeted
recruitment, retention, and progression initiatives,
exceeding the global average of 48%.
Overall, 69% of employers in Japan highlight
ageing and declining working-age populations as a
critical trend impacting their organization by 2030,
exceeding the global average of 40%. According to
55% of respondents, cultural resistance to change
remains a barrier to business transformation,
alongside skills gaps (41%) and industry talent
shortages (49%). Information Security Analysts
and Data Analysts and Scientists are projected
to be among the top growing jobs in the country.
In response, businesses operating in the country
are planning to prioritize access to diverse talent

65

and supporting reskilling. Employers also share
expectations for greater government involvement in
provisioning and funding of reskilling and upskilling.
Geoeconomic fragmentation and advances in
frontier technologies are likely to drive labour-market
transformation in Republic of Korea in the next five
years: 71% of companies operating in the country
highlight increased geopolitical tensions as a key
trend impacting their business, more than twice
the global average, and 53% mention increased
restrictions to global trade. Businesses in Republic
of Korea are ahead of global peers in technologies
such as semiconductors and new materials. Talent
shortages at the industry level are a concern for
47% of respondents. Companies are planning
on addressing skills gaps by hiring staff with
emerging skills (92%) and adopting technologies
to augment the workforce (83%). Additionally,
employers operating in Republic of Korea plan to
explore workforce strategies such as supplementing
childcare for working parents (50%) to attract and
retain talent.
Businesses operating in Australia foresee
a complex mix of technological, green and
demographic transitions, as well as geoeconomic
fragmentation: 65% of employers identify skills
gaps, while 45% view inability to attract talent to the
industry as a key business challenge over the 20252030 period. To address the increasing need for
skilled talent, 45% of respondents hope for changes
to immigration policies to attract global talent,
compared to a global average of 26%. Additionally,
49% of businesses operating in Australia anticipate

offering cross-border remote work options, nearly
double the global average, and 63% identify tapping
into diverse talent pools as an effective approach to
increasing talent availability in the country.

South-Eastern Asia
Advances in technology, uncertain economic
outlook and increasing geoeconomic fragmentation
are foreseen to be shaping labour markets in
South-Eastern Asia over the 2025-2030 period.
To prepare for these disruptions and meet emerging
business needs, employers headquartered in the
region are particularly focused on upskilling their
workforce (96%, compared to 85% globally) and
hiring staff with new skills (86%, compared to
70% globally), with a large number of businesses
in Indonesia, Malaysia and the Philippines also
expecting to address these challenges by facilitating
internal job transitions. Finding skilled talent
continues to be seen as a main barrier to business
transformation, with employers in Singapore and
Viet Nam, in particular, calling for policy reforms to
expand the talent base in these countries.
Digitalization is perceived as the most important
driver of labour-market transformation in Indonesia
by 2030, with 83% of businesses operating in
the country expecting this trend to impact their
organization, compared to 60% globally. Fortyone percent of employers also highlight increased
restrictions on trade and investment as a key
trend impacting their businesses, which is almost
Future of Jobs Report 2025

66

twice the global average. A higher share than
global peers aim to leverage new materials and
composites (52%) as well as sensing, laser and
optical technologies (39%). Workforce strategies are
expected to focus on transitioning employees from
declining to growing roles, with AI Specialists and
Sustainability Specialists leading job growth, and
administrative and data entry roles in decline.

their reskilling efforts: 68% of Filipino workers are
expected to require training to meet evolving skill
demands (compared to 59% globally), but only 38%
of workers are reported to have completed training
today (compared to 50% globally). Employers
operating in the Philippines anticipate that almost
three in 10 workers will be upskilled and then redeployed to new roles.

Overall, companies operating in Malaysia
expect increased restrictions on global trade and
investment (45%), alongside a heightened focus
on government subsidies and industrial policy
(34%) and stricter anti-trust regulations (31%) to
drive transformation of their businesses by 2030.
These responses are all above the respective
global averages. Employers also regard broadening
digital access as a key driver of transformation,
highlighted by 79% of respondents. In response
to these disruptions, businesses in Malaysia are
exploring distinct approaches to reskilling: While
most organizations anticipate self-funding their
training programmes, 32% of reskilling efforts are
expected to be co-funded across the industry,
twice the global level. In addition, 35% of employers
in the country plan to consider completion of short
courses and online certifications when assessing
skills of job candidates, more than twice the global
average (14%).

In Singapore, 64% of employers operating in
the country expect their business to be impacted
by geoeconomic fragmentation, twice the global
average. Similar to global and regional peers, firms
in Singapore expect skills gaps, regulatory barriers
and organizational resistance to hinder business
transformation. Notably, 97% of companies plan to
prioritize upskilling as their key workforce strategy,
significantly above global levels. Hiring staff with
emerging skills and process automation are also
among anticipated key workforce strategies. While
a skills-first approach is perceived as having the
potential to expand Singapore’s talent pool, 58% of
employers expect to continue prioritizing university
degrees in hiring decisions, which is higher than the
43% global average.

Broadening digital access and climate mitigation
and adaptation efforts are expected to jointly shape
labour-market dynamics in the Philippines by
2030. With two-thirds of employers in the country
identifying skills gaps as a barrier over the next
half decade, businesses are planning to scale up

Economic uncertainty is top of mind for employers
operating in Thailand, with 73% of respondents
expecting slower growth to impact their business
by 2030 – above the global average of 42% – and
rising inflation and climate-mitigation efforts among
other anticipated key trends. Talent acquisition
is seen as challenging, with 62% of respondents
facing difficulty attracting talent to their industry
and 46% to their firms. Employers in Thailand
are increasingly planning on leveraging diversity,

Future of Jobs Report 2025

67

equity and inclusion programmes (64%) and
supplementing childcare for working parents
(45%). With regard to public policies, funding for
reskilling and upskilling and flexibility on hiring and
firing practices are seen as the two most beneficial
policies to expand the talent base.
A majority of companies operating in Viet Nam
expect increased digitalization, climate mitigation
action and higher cost of living to shape the
transformation of their business models over the
2025-2030 period. About one in two employers
also highlights restrictions on global trade and
investment among the most impactful trends for
their business, twice the global average of 23%. For
more than 60% of firms in the country, adapting to
these trends is perceived to be made more difficult
by existing skills gaps in the labour market, while
55% of respondents mention inadequate data and
technical infrastructure and 41% point to limited
understanding of emerging opportunities. To close
skills gaps, a majority of employers in the country
expect the most impactful public-policy measures
to be increased public funding for reskilling and
upskilling as well as more flexible hiring and
firing practices. Half of respondents also point to
adjustments to immigration laws (50%, compared
to 26% globally) and retirement ages (46%,
compared to 25% globally).

Central Asia and Southern Asia
Increased digital access, geopolitical tensions and
climate-mitigation efforts are the primary trends
expected to shape the future of jobs in India by
2030. Similar to their global peers, companies
operating in the country are heavily investing
in AI, robotics and autonomous systems, and
energy technologies. Employers in India are also
planning to outpace global adoption in certain
technologies, with 35% expecting semiconductors
and computing technologies and 21% expecting
quantum and encryption to transform their
operations. The country’s projected fastestgrowing job roles – including Big Data Specialists,
AI and Machine Learning Specialists, and Security
Management Specialists – align closely with these
trends. To address talent needs, companies
operating in India expect tapping into diverse
talent pools (67%, compared to 47% globally) and
adopting skills-based hiring by removing degree
requirements (30%, compared to 19% globally) to
be effective.
Companies operating in Kazakhstan expect
broadening digital access, rising cost of living
and slower economic growth to significantly
impact their business models in the next five
years. Technological trends related to AI, robotics
and autonomous systems are also expected to
have a significant – although lower than global
average – impact, with energy generation, storage
and distribution identified as the second-most
impactful technological trend (highlighted by 54% of

respondents). Skills gaps in the labour market are
top-of-mind for seven in 10 firms in the country.
Addressing skills gaps in the labour market is
identified as a primary challenge to business
transformation over the 2025 to 2030 period
in Uzbekistan. While 71% of employers in the
country expect improvements in talent retention,
significantly above the global average, there remains
strong need for reskilling and upskilling the current
workforce. Overall, only 22% of Uzbekistan’s
workforce today is expected to be able to upskill in
their current role, with an additional 14% projected
to be upskilled and then re-deployed, both of which
are lower figures than global averages at 29% and
19%, respectively. Fifty-two percent of employers
anticipate implementing strategies for reskilling
their workforce to work alongside AI. Skills such
as programming, teaching and mentoring, and
multilingualism have higher-than-global projected
demand increases.

Middle East and Northern Africa
Companies headquartered in the Middle East and
Northern Africa region are more positive about
talent availability by 2030 than their global peers,
with 46% of employers expecting the hiring outlook
to improve. Employers in the region, notably in
Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, are also
planning on accelerating automation. With 46% of
on-the-job skills projected to change, compared to
39% worldwide, the region’s rate of skill disruption
is most pronounced in countries such as Egypt
and Bahrain, highlighting the need for reskilling and
upskilling at a time of multi-dimensional change.
Only 5% of firms operating in Bahrain identify
aging and declining working-age populations as a
transformative trend by 2030, compared to 40% of
respondents globally. Talent availability is expected
to remain stable, with only 8% of employers
anticipating a deterioration, which is far below the
global average. However, two-thirds of employers
expect skills gaps in the labour market to remain
the top barrier to business transformation. Twentyfour percent of Bahrain’s employees are expected
to be able to upskill in their current roles, and an
additional 14% to be redeployed after upskilling;
both figures are below global averages. To attract
skilled talent, employers in the country are focused
on improving working hours and overtime policies
and expecting to leverage government wage
subsidies.
In Egypt, rising cost of living, slower economic
growth and broadening digital access are the key
trends expected to influence the labour market by
2030. Fifty-five percent of employers operating in

5.2 Industry insights
Cross-industry trends and scope
for collaboration
The anticipated impact of macrotrends on the future
of jobs is multi-faceted across both geographies
and sectors. Specific industries are seeing points
of convergence as well as distinct barriers to
transformation and thus are prioritizing different
workforce strategies in response to labour-market
transformation by 2030. While 19 out of 22
global industries covered by the report identify
skills gaps in the local labour market as the top
barrier to industry transformation, each sector
also anticipates distinct additional challenges in

the next five years. In both the Government and
Public sector and Medical and Healthcare sector,
for example, organizational culture and resistance
to change features as the most-selected barrier to
transformation. In the Real Estate sector, inability
to attract talent to the industry is seen as the key
obstacle. Four sectors – Agriculture, Forestry, and
Fishing; Information and Technology Services; Oil
and Gas; and Retail and Wholesale of Consumer
Goods – view data and technical infrastructure as
one of the key barriers. As shown in Figure 5.1,
most industries see talent attractiveness at the
industry level as a bigger issue than at the firm level
over the 2025-2030 period (with Automotive and
Aerospace, Education and Training, and Information
Technology being the three exceptions).

The fact that Future of Jobs Survey respondents
predominantly evaluate talent availability challenges
as industry-level issues points to potentially
untapped opportunities for industry stakeholders
to collaborate and implement customized intraindustry or cross-industry solutions. However,
employers across industries often exhibit different
preferences over workforce strategies.
Reaching close to a consensus view, upskilling
is selected as the top workforce strategy
in 20 industries and ranks second in the
remaining two: Electronics and Insurance and
Pensions Management. Oil and Gas (96%) and
Telecommunications (96%) are the industries most
committed to upskilling, while a still significant 73%
of Education and Training industry employers plan
to focus on this strategy.
There exist more notable industry differences
with regard to anticipated use of technologies
to either fully automate processes and tasks or
complement and augment the human workforce,
as shown in Figure 5.2. While most industries aim

FIGURE 5.2

to pursue a balance of both automation-focused
and augmentation-focused workforce strategies
over the 2025-2030 period, 87% of respondents in
Electronics expect to focus on automating tasks,
whereas only 48% plan to focus on workforce
augmentation. Industries including Insurance and
Pensions as well as Telecommunications exhibit
a similar automation-to-augmentation gap. By
contrast, sectors such as Healthcare, Agriculture,
and Government report a higher preference for
augmentation over automation.
Additionally, while hiring staff with new skills to
meet emerging business needs features among
the top three workforce strategies in 17 out of 22
sectors – possibly precipitating strong intra- and
inter-industry competition over talent over the next
five years – upskilling and transitioning existing staff
from declining to growing job roles appears as an
untapped opportunity: only the Automotive and
Aerospace, Electronics, and Real Estate sectors
currently aim to prioritize such job transitions as one
of their top three workforce strategies by 2030.

Industry-level findings
By 2030, transformation of the Accommodation,
Food, and Leisure industry is expected to be
shaped by rising cost of living and a greater
focus on labour and social issues. Increased
digitalization – while still relevant for a significant
51% of respondents – appears as less central
than in other industries. The focus placed by the
industry on human experience and social issues
is reflected in the human-technology frontier, as
companies anticipate continued reliance on humans
to predominantly deliver 43% of total work tasks
over the next five years, higher than the global
industry average. However, talent availability is a
growing concern, with 59% of employers expecting
hiring challenges to worsen. To respond to these
emerging trends, firms are scaling up upskilling
efforts, hiring for emerging skills and augmenting
workforce with new technologies, while also
aiming to improve the industry’s attractiveness
by supporting employee health and well-being,
improving wages and talent progression. About one
third of companies is investing in diversity, equity
and inclusion efforts, focusing particularly on young
talent (69%, compared to the 52% global industry
average) and migrant workers (33%, compared to
20% globally).
The Advanced Manufacturing sector expects
to undergo transformation shaped by increased
investments to reduce carbon emissions and
adapt to climate change and rising cost of living.
Companies are anticipating the adoption of AI
(81%), robotics (69%), and new materials and

composites (63%, almost twice as many as in
other industries). The industry predicts increasing
demand for AI and big data skills, creative thinking,
networks and cybersecurity skills, but also systems
thinking, design and user experience, and resource
management. To prepare for these changes,
employers expect to be able to upskill 29% of
workers in their current role, while they foresee
a need for 15% of workers to be reskilled and
re-deployed in the next five years. Fifty percent of
firms are planning to tap into diverse talent pools to
ease labour shortages, and 55% (more than in most
other industries) plan to focus their diversity, equity
and inclusion efforts on workers aged 55 years and
above.
Skills gaps are seen as the key barrier to
transformation for businesses in the Agriculture,
Forestry, and Fishing industry by 2030 (selected
by 68% of respondents), followed by outdated
regulations (51%, compared to the 39% global
industry average) and insufficient data infrastructure
(46%, compared to 32% globally). Climate
mitigation and adaptation are key challenges
highlighted by the industry, alongside rising cost of
living. As employers address these challenges, they
are planning to upgrade their workforce strategies
by emphasizing upskilling and reskilling, hiring
for new skills, and augmenting their workforce
with technology. The top three skills on the rise
are predicted to be resilience, flexibility and
agility, technological literacy, and environmental
stewardship, while skills related to AI and big data,
networks, and cybersecurity are growing more
slowly than in other industries. One-third of firms
in the industry do not have a diversity, equity and

Future of Jobs Report 2025

84

inclusion programme, while 63% expect wages
to account for a growing share of employers’
total revenues, with 92% intending to align wages
with productivity and 46% aiming to reduce wage
inequalities.
The Automotive and Aerospace sector stands out
for its expectation regarding the significant impact
that both climate mitigation and geoeconomic
fragmentation might have on the industry in the
next five years: 54% of respondents identify rising
geopolitical tensions (compared to 34% across
other industries) and 46% highlight increasing trade
restrictions (compared to 23% in other industries)
as key drivers of change. About one-fourth of
industry players are evaluating options to reshore,
nearshore or friendshore, and 16% to offshore –
suggesting the possibility of greater supply chain
re-organization than in other industries. These
trends point to considerable transformation for
most companies, with skills gaps in labour markets,
organizational cultures and resistance to change
identified as top barriers, alongside difficulties to
attract talent to the industry (highlighted by 42% of
respondents, compared to 37% in other industries)
and limited access to investment capital (40%,
compared to 26% in other industries). Employers
are prioritizing workforce strategies that focus on
upskilling, automating processes, and transitioning
staff from declining to growing roles. Jobs on the
rise are predicted to include Robotics Engineers
and Data Analysts and Scientists.
In the Chemical and Advanced Materials sector,
industry transformation is foreseen to be heavily
influenced by investments in the green and digital
transitions, leading to a projected increase in job
roles for AI and Machine Learning Specialists and
Business Development Professionals by 2030.
The industry also anticipates a need for more AI
and big data as well as environmental stewardship
skills. However, the human factor is expected to
pose a significant barrier for the industry, with skills
gaps in the labour markets and talent attraction
to the industry identified as the top two obstacles
to industry transformation. To improve industry
attractiveness, companies are planning to focus
on talent progression and promotion processes,
supporting employees’ health and well-being
and offering higher wages. Employers suggest
governments should support upskilling and
reskilling and improve education systems, as well
as provide wage subsidies and greater flexibility in
wage setting. Nine in 10 companies in the industry
plan to align wages closely with productivity while
only 9% plan to review wage costs as part of costreduction exercises in the next five years.
Broadening digital access, increased focus on
labour and social issues, and slower economic
growth are expected to drive the transformation
of the Education and Training sector by 2030.
AI and big data skills as well as creative thinking
are foreseen to grow in importance. Emerging
job roles within the industry are anticipated to
include AI and Machine Learning Specialists and

Digital Transformation Specialists. Employers also
place greater emphasis than in other industries
on curiosity and lifelong learning, marketing and
media skills and multilingualism. The industry is
less focused than other sectors on upskilling and
reskilling its own workforce (73%, compared to
the 85% global industry average), while employers
aim to improve attractiveness through better talent
progression and promotion processes, higher
wages, and supporting employee well-being.
By 2030, the landscape of the Electronics sector
is expected to be shaped by increased climate
mitigation efforts, continued digitalization of the
economy, and aging and shrinking workforces,
while the industry appears less concerned about
economic cycles: only 25% of respondents
anticipate significant impact from slower economic
growth, compared to 42% across all sectors. With
AI, robotics and energy technologies targeted for
adoption, industry job growth is predicted for AI and
Machine Learning Specialists and Electrotechnology
Engineers. Talent availability is seen as a concern,
with 61% of employers expecting hiring challenges
to worsen but only 9% worried about talent
retention (compared to 19% global industry
average). Workforce strategies are planned to focus
on automation, upskilling, and transitioning staff to
growing roles. Other than public policy support on
reskilling and upskilling, firms also call for improved
transport infrastructure to enhance talent availability.
Over the next five years, climate mitigation is
foreseen to be at the centre of the Energy
Technology and Utilities sector, as companies
plan to invest in greener technologies for energy
generation, storage and distribution. As a result,
Environmental Engineers, AI and Machine Learning
Specialists and Renewable Energy Engineers
are among the expected top-growing job roles
in the sector. As employers aim to transform
their business, industry players are particularly
concerned about skills gaps in the labour market
(81%, compared to 63% across all industries),
alongside outdated or unflexible regulations
(44%), organizational culture and resistance to
change, and the industry’s capacity to attract
talent (37%). To improve talent availability and
industry attractiveness, businesses are planning
on improving talent progression and promotion
processes and investing in reskilling and upskilling
programmes, for which respondents see a role for
increased financial support from the public sector.
Increased digitalization is seen as the primary
driver of transformation in the Financial Services
and Capital Markets sector over the next five
years, alongside adaptation to climate change
and slower economic growth. The sector also
anticipates being particularly exposed to AI, with
only 5% of employers expecting no significant
adoption of the technology by 2030 (compared to
14% across all industries). As a result, AI and big
data skills, technological literacy and cybersecurity
skills are estimated to be in high demand and the
industry anticipates creation of new job roles for
Future of Jobs Report 2025

85

Big Data Specialists, AI and Machine Learning
Specialists, and Security Management Specialists.
To improve talent availability, the industry is
planning on investing in reskilling and upskilling
(71% of employers), supporting employees’ wellbeing (64%) and improving promotion processes
(61%). Remote and hybrid work is also seen as a
strategy to stay attractive for 58% of companies
in the industry, and one out of two respondents
is calling for changes to labour laws that support
remote work (compared to 36% in other sectors).
The industry is particularly advanced in its plans to
remove degree requirements in favour of skillsbased hiring approaches (28%, compared to 19%
across all industries).
Employers in the Government and Public Sector
identify organizational culture and resistance to
change as the top barrier to transformation by
2030, as the sector plans to continue investing
in digital and green transformation over the
next five years. In line with global trends, AI
and big data, Networks and cybersecurity and
Technological literacy are the skills with highest
perceived increasing importance, followed by
Environmental stewardship and creative thinking
skills. Skills gaps in the labour market and outdated
regulatory frameworks are seen as potentially
slowing down transformation of the sector. Overall,
public employers are positive about future talent
availability, with 52% of respondents expecting
improvements in the next five years. To increase
sector attractiveness and strengthen the sector
talent base, 80% of employers are planning

on enhancing talent progression and providing
reskilling and upskilling programmes in the next five
years.
Information and Technology Services companies
are heavily focused on adopting advanced
technologies by 2030, with anticipated nearuniversal uptake of AI and information processing
(99%, compared to the 86% global industry
average) and a strong focus also on quantum
and encryption technologies (41%, compared
to 12% globally). Growing job roles in the sector
are foreseen to include Digital Transformation
Specialists, Software and Applications Developers,
and Sales and Marketing Professionals. Alongside
AI and cybersecurity skills, the industry expects
stronger emphasis on resilience, flexibility, and
agility than most other sectors, while more
employers expect demand for programming and
design and user experience skills to decline than
in other industries. Workforce strategies aim to
prioritize upskilling and hiring talent with new
skills to address emerging needs, alongside a
higher tendency to reduce staff with less relevant
skills (49%, compared to 41% in other industries)
and offshore segments of the workforce (17%,
compared to 8%).
By 2030, transformation of the Infrastructure
sector is foreseen to be driven by a need to
increase investments in carbon reduction, climate
adaptation and digitalization. As a result, new
job roles are expected to be created for Big Data
Specialists and Organizational Development

Specialists. Top skills on the rise are anticipated to
be linked to AI and big data as well as networks
and cybersecurity, and talent management skills
are expected to grow in demand at a faster rate
than the global industry average. Twenty-seven
percent of employees in the sector are anticipated
to be able to upskill in their current roles, with
an additional 17% projected to be reskilled and
redeployed. Almost 70% of respondents expect
reskilling and upskilling to improve talent retention
and enhance competitiveness and productivity of
their company, with 50% planning to increase talent
mobility through training programmes.

culture and resistance to change, alongside
outdated regulations and skills gaps in the labour
market. Emerging job roles in the industry are
expected to include Data Analysts and Scientists
and AI and Machine Learning Specialists, with
significant emphasis on AI and big data and
technological literacy as the top skills increasingly
in demand. While prioritizing business practices
that support employee health and well-being
(57%), providing effective reskilling and upskilling
(63%), and offering competitive wages (49%) are
seen as key workforce strategies, the industry also
increasingly plans to tap into diverse talent pools.

Over the next five years, evolution of the global
economic outlook, and population dynamics
across the world are predicted to drive industry
transformation in the Insurance and Pensions
Management sector. Continued adoption of
digital technologies is also foreseen to transform
the industry, with 97% of employers planning to
accelerate automation of processes and tasks,
which is significantly above the global industry
average. The sector also expects higher-thanaverage levels of workforce augmentation, with
41% of total work tasks projected to be completed
by human-technology collaboration by 2030. AI and
big data, creative thinking, and technological literacy
are seen as the top skills on the rise. While 42% of
employers predict talent availability at the point of
hiring to worsen, the industry is strongly focused on
upskilling and reskilling: 91% of employers plan to
upskill their workforce to adapt to evolving needs
and – as a result – 82% expect talent development
to improve in the next five years.

With industry transformation by 2030 seen as
predominantly shaped by climate adaptation and
climate mitigation trends, the Mining and Metals
sector is also mindful of growing restrictions on
global trade and investment, with 55% of firms
identifying this as a key trend (compared to 23% in
other industries). Considering the green transition,
79% of industry players expect transformative
impact from energy technologies, while AI is
anticipated to be less ubiquitous (66%) than in other
sectors. The use of autonomous technology to
complete work tasks is projected to increase faster
than in other industries. AI and Machine Learning
Specialists and Mining, Petroleum and Other
Extraction Workers are expected to see growing
demand in the industry in the next five years, with AI
and big data and environmental stewardship seen
as leading skills on the rise. To attract and retain
talent, firms are planning on prioritizing employee
health and well-being (79%) and workplace safety
(53%), as well as better articulating business
purpose and impact (63%).

The digital transition, higher cost of living and an
increasingly aging population are among the key
drivers of transformation anticipated for Medical
and Healthcare Services over the 2025-2030
period. In particular, aging population is highlighted
as a key factor by 59% of companies in the
industry, compared to 40% across all sectors.
As they aim to adapt to these trends, firms cite
challenges in terms of their own organizational

By 2030, the Oil and Gas sector expects to evolve
and transform to reduce carbon emissions and
adapt to climate change. According to 40% of
respondents from the industry, industrial policy and
government subsidies will also impact companies’
strategies in the next five years. As companies plan
to adopt cleaner technologies they see increasing
demand for skills in environmental stewardship,

alongside AI and big data and technological literacy.
New job roles are expected to be created for AI and
Machine Learning Specialists and Data Analysts
and Scientists. Anticipated workforce strategies
in the sector are oriented toward upskilling, with
96% of firms planning on investing in workforce
development (compared to 85% across all
industries), as well as accelerating automation
and augmenting their human workforce with new
technologies.
Industry transformation in the Production of
Consumer Goods sector is foreseen to be
influenced in particular by rising cost of living and
increased investments in carbon reduction over the
next five years. Additionally, the industry predicts
a need to take into account growing focus on
emerging labour and social issues (highlighted by
58% of firms, compared to the 46% global industry
average). Companies are anticipating actively
adopting advanced technologies, with higher-thanaverage uptake of robots and autonomous systems
(71%, compared to 58% across all sectors) and
new materials and composites (61%, compared to
30%). However, 56% of employers expect talent
availability to become more difficult in the next five
years. To address talent shortages, companies are
planning on supporting workers’ health and wellbeing (73%) and improving working hours (52%),
while they see potential in public policy support with
regard to flexibility in hiring and firing, flexibility in
setting wages, and reforming immigration laws.
By 2030, firms in the Professional Services sector
expect continued digitalization, rising cost of living
and increased focus on labour and social issues

to impact industry transformation. Workforce
strategies anticipated for the sector emphasize
upskilling, hiring talent with emerging skills, and
augmenting the human workforce with new
technologies. There is also expected to be a higher
focus on reducing job roles with outdated skills,
with 48% of companies envisaging prioritizing this
approach (compared to 40% across all industries).
One in five employers plan to move operations
closer to their headquarter location through reshoring or near-shoring. Big Data Specialists and
AI and Machine Learning Specialists are among the
job roles with the larges projected industry demand,
while AI and big data, technological literacy, creative
thinking, and cybersecurity are leading the list of
skills seen as increasingly in use over the next five
years.
Business cycle uncertainty, in terms of both
economic growth and inflation, are expected to
particularly impact the transformation of the Real
Estate industry in the next five years. To react to
an evolving landscape, companies plan to adapt
their workforce strategies, prioritizing upskilling and
reskilling and hiring new talent with relevant skills.
Emerging job roles in the industry are foreseen to
include AI and Machine Learning Specialists and
Business Development Professionals. Demand for
AI and big data skills, creative thinking, and curiosity
and lifelong learning is projected to grow across all
industry roles. Sixty percent of employers highlight
the sector’s inability to attract talent as a key barrier
to transformation by 2030. To increase industry
attractiveness, a majority of companies intends
to support employee health and well-being and
provide better training opportunities, as only 34% of

employees in the industry have currently undergone
reskilling or upskilling, compared to a global
industry average of 50%. One-third of employers
are planning to offer higher wages and one in five
plan to leverage diversity, equity and inclusion
programmes: both shares are below the global
industry averages of 50% and 39%, respectively.
Over the next five years, companies in the Retail
and Wholesale of Consumer Goods sector
expect industry transformation to be impacted
by rising cost of living (68%, compared to 50%
across all industries) and increased focus on
labour and social issues (64%, compared to 46%).
Talent shortages are seen as pronounced in the
sector, with 58% of employers expecting talent
availability to become more difficult by 2030 and
28% anticipating declines in talent retention. To
adapt workforce strategies, companies are planning
on prioritizing upskilling and reskilling of current
workers, automation of tasks, and recruitment of
talent with emerging skills. Forty-one percent of
employers are considering transitioning existing staff
from declining job roles to growth areas, presenting
an under-utilized opportunity for the industry to
invest in job transitions. Emerging job roles in the
industry are anticipated to include AI and Machine
Learning Specialists, Digital Marketing and Strategy
Specialists, and Big Data Specialists.
With 37% of on-the-job skills used today expected
to change by 2030, the Supply Chain and
Transportation industry reports having already
put significant effort into reskilling and upskilling,
with 57% of employees having completed training
programmes, above most other industries. As the

industry transforms in response to increased digital
access, climate mitigation and adaptation, and
rising cost of living, growing job roles in the industry
are foreseen to include Light Truck or Delivery
Services Drivers; Client Information and Customer
Service Workers; and Car, Van and Motorcycle
Drivers. Companies see increasing demand in skills
such as AI and big data, technological literacy, and
networks and cybersecurity. Analytical thinking
is also identified as a priority, with 79% of firms
expecting increasing its use, a higher share than in
other industries. However, a majority of respondents
regards the industry’s inability to attract talent as a
potential risk that could stall transformation.
As digital access and connectivity continue to
increase globally, they are expected to drive
industry transformation in the Telecommunications
sector over the next five years. Adoption of AI is
anticipated to play a strong role in the future of
the industry, while 40% of companies are also
preparing to make greater use of space and satellite
technologies. Growing job roles in the industry
are expected to include AI and Machine Learning
Specialists, Big Data Specialists, and Data Analysts
and Scientists. To enable industry transformation,
96% of employers plan to upskill and reskill their
workforce and 82% intend to increase automation
of tasks within work processes. To attract talent,
48% of companies – twice the global industry
average – plan to offer remote work across borders,
while 22% of respondents are evaluating options
for moving operations closer to their homebase
through reshoring or nearshoring.

Future of Jobs Report 2025

Conclusions
The transformation of the jobs and skills landscape
anticipated by this year’s Future of Jobs Survey
respondents will have significant impacts on
businesses, industries, governments and workers
worldwide. It is crucial to develop nuanced
forecasts, identify appropriate workforce and
talent strategies, and make informed decisions
on managing disruptions to jobs and skills for
employers and workers alike.
This edition of the Future of Jobs Report presents a
mixed picture with regard to the 2025-2030 outlook
for the global labour market. On the one hand,
amid newly emerging drivers such as increasing
geoeconomic fragmentation, rising cost of living
and the widespread adoption of AI tools in the
workforce, global macrotrends create an evermore complex environment for policy-makers,
employers and workers to navigate, and uncertainty
remains high. On the other hand, the report
finds a strongly net-positive global employment
outlook, with a continuing decrease in the rate of
skills obsolescence, as reskilling, upskilling and
redeployment initiatives implemented in recent
years begin to register in the data and materialize
their global workforce impact.

However, skills gaps remain the predominant
barrier to transformation across most industries
and economies, and this year’s edition of the
Future of Jobs Report captures some early signals
of likely future priority areas for constructive
multistakeholder engagement, including a need
for proactive and dynamic job transitions across a
wider and growing range of job roles and questions
concerning the appropriate future balance between
deeper automation and broader augmentation.
This last point reflects a core tenet of the Future of
Jobs Report since its inception: that the future of
work can be shaped for better outcomes and that
it is the policy, business and investment decisions
made by leaders today that will determine these
outcomes and the future space for action. The
World Economic Forum is actively supporting
the building of a future-ready, inclusive workforce
through its two human capital flagship initiatives:
The Reskilling Revolution and The Jobs Initiative.
We hope that this report will contribute to an
ambitious multistakeholder agenda to better
prepare workers, businesses, governments,
educators and civil society, empowering them to
build a better future of jobs for all.

Employers across all industries and geographies
demonstrate greater awareness and willingness
than in previous editions of the report to
proactively engage in addressing workforce and
talent challenges, and to do so by pragmatically
leveraging innovative approaches such as skillsbased hiring policies and a more strategic focus on
diversity, equity and inclusion.

If AI significantly complements human labour, particularly in certain occupations, it could lead to productivity surges,
higher growth, and potentially higher incomes for most workers. This productivity boost might offset some of the negative

Future of Jobs Report 2025

Appendix:
Report Methodology
This report is based on an analysis of the results of
the edition of an extensive survey of Chief People,
Chief Learning Officers, Chief Strategy Offices
and Chief Executive Officers of leading global
employers. Established in 2015, the Future of Jobs
Survey has been instrumental in providing insights
into the evolution of jobs and skills and the future
labour market. It is a pioneering measurement tool
that enables companies and governments to map
their workforce planning for the next five years.
Survey data is collected across economies and
industries, providing a compass for private- and
public-sector leaders who strive to ensure a better
future of work for all.

Survey design
The Future of Jobs Survey 2024 builds on the
methodology from the previous survey editions.
Following survey best practices and informed by
literature review, several questions were refined and
new questions were added.
The survey consists of five interrelated parts.
Business Trends 2024-2030 focuses on the
macrotrends and technology adoption. It also
examines the organizations’ transformation barriers.
Occupation Trends 2024-2030 identifies the roles
and how these are expected to evolve up until
2030. It also studies how the macrotrends and
technology trends contribute to the job growth
and decline. Skill Trends 2024-2030 analyses the
skills in demand and collects information on training
programmes and employee reskilling needs and
efforts. Workforce Practices 2024-2030 explores
the talent strategies and talent-management
practices in organizations. People and Technology
assesses the automation and augmentation level
at the job and task level, as well as companies’
approach to enabling people and technology
working together.
The survey is comprised of 38 questions and was
made available in 12 languages: Arabic, Bahasa
Indonesia, Chinese (simplified), French, Hebrew,
Japanese, Portuguese, Russian, Serbian, Spanish,
Turkish and Vietnamese. The survey collection
process was conducted via Qualtrics, with data
collection spanning a four-month period from May
to September 2024.

Representativeness
The survey set out to represent the current
strategies, projections and estimates of global
businesses, with a focus on large multinational
companies and more localized companies which
are of significance due to their employee or revenue
size. As such, there are two areas of the future of
jobs that remain out of scope for this report: the
future of jobs as it relates to the activities of small
enterprises and as it relates to the informal sector.
The Future of Jobs Survey was distributed through
collaboration between the World Economic Forum
and its regional survey partners, amplified by the
World Economic Forum’s extensive network and
its constituents. The survey is also the result of
cross-departmental coordination within the World
Economic Forum. The Forum’s Global Industries
Team supported the report team’s efforts to collect
relevant samples. For key partners in the survey
distribution process, please refer to both the Survey
Partners and Acknowledgements sections.
Detailed sample design specifications were shared
with survey partners, requesting that the sample of
companies targeted for participation in the survey
should be drawn from a cross-section of leading
companies that make up an economy or region’s
economy. The target companies were specified as
the largest multinational and national companies,
significant in terms of revenue or employee size.
The threshold was set at companies with 500
employees or more as questions concerning
job and skill outlook are most relevant for larger
companies with a significant share of employment.
The final sub-selection of economies with data of
sufficient quality to be featured in the report was
based on the overall number of responses from
companies with a presence in each economy. The
survey has arrived at a sample in which more than
half of the companies surveyed operate in more
than one economy, and a reasonable range of
companies maintained a focused local or regional
presence. The final sub-selection of industries was
included based on the overall number of responses
by industry, in addition to a qualitative review of the
pool of named companies represented in the survey
data. The final sub-selection of regions and income
groups was included based on the headquarter
locations of the companies.

Classification frameworks for
jobs and skills
This year’s report employed the Occupational
Information Network (O*NET) framework, crosswalked with the International Standard Classification
of Occupations (ISCO). O*NET was developed
by the US Department of Labour in collaboration
with its Bureau of Labour Statistics’ Standard
Classification of Occupations (SOC) and remains
the most extensive and respected classification of
its kind. ISCO is a classification system developed
by the International Labour Organization (ILO) to
organize information on jobs and labour. It is a part
of the UN’s classification system for social and
economic purposes. The list of roles used in the
report has been enhanced with roles which were
consistently added to previous editions of the report
and refer to the emerging roles from data partner
collaborations.
Both the Future of Jobs survey and the Future
of Jobs report use the World Economic Forum’s
Global Skills Taxonomy to categorize skills (Table
A2). Built on a foundation of data insights and
ongoing inputs from our network of partners, the
taxonomy focuses on the skills that are needed
by workers across sectors and regions in a fastchanging labour market. It is designed to serve
as a “universal adapter” between data presented
in the language of the many region and industry
specific skills taxonomies in use. You may view the
Global Skills Taxonomy on the Reskilling Revolution
webpage. New data from the Future of Jobs Survey
is presented in Chapter 3.

Metrics
Statistical samples presented in this report
correspond to organizations’ self-reported
economies and industries of operation. Each
organization which responded to the Future of
Jobs Survey was permitted to associate itself with
up to 10 economies and up to three industries of
operation.

Most metrics presented in this report are shares
of respondents identifying their organization with
a business strategy/impact or the mean value of a
metric relating to business operations which was
directly estimated by respondents. A small number
of metrics relating to labour markets and skills
are derived from information provided in different
formats. These are described below.

Net growth in employment and labour-market
churn
This edition of the Future of Jobs Report continues
to estimate growth and labour-market churn in the
next five years. Net growth represents the forecast
increase or decrease in the size of a workforce,
either as a fraction of its current size, or in millions
of employees. Labour-market churn represents the
sum of job losses and created jobs in a workforce
as a fraction of its initial size. In this report both

concepts are applied to roles in the jobs taxonomy
(see Table A3) and industries in the industry
taxonomy (see Table A1). The figures correspond
to changes forecast by survey respondents for a
five-year period between 2025 and 2030, with the
survey being administered from May to August
2024. Metrics relating to both concepts reflect
forecast structural changes in employment across

companies, economies, industries and roles.
Turnover induced by employees moving between
jobs for personal reasons is not included.

Fractional metrics
Respondents aggregated roles included in the jobs
taxonomy to six groups:
–

Main roles in the organization with a growing
employment outlook for the next five years

–

Main roles in the organization with a declining
employment outlook for the next five years

–

Main roles in the organization with a stable
employment outlook for the next five years

–

Roles that are relatively small presently but
strategically important and with a growing
employment outlook for the next five years

Respondents allocated up to five roles from the jobs
taxonomy to each of the four groups. One of the five
roles in the presently relatively small but strategically
important and with a growing employment outlook
could be specified by a free-text field. Free-text
fields were subsequently allocated to jobs in the jobs
taxonomy where possible. Metrics on roles are only
published in the report when they meet statistical
criteria in a given sample.
Respondents subsequently allocated workforce
fractions to each of the above groups of jobs at
present, and estimated the growth and decline of
the main roles with growing outlook, main roles with
declining outlook, and relatively small roles presently
with growing outlook. These workforce fractions
were used to calculate two metrics: estimated net
growth between 2025 and 2030 and estimated
structural labour-market churn from 2025 to 2030,
for the labour forces pertaining to roles in the jobs
taxonomy. In the calculation of net growth, for a
specific role, a simple mean of the growth and
decline was first calculated based on projection
from the respondents who have selected this role,
while the growth of the roles identified as stable
outlook is zero. The net growth draws on weighted
averages of the growth and decline weighted on the
number of respondents who consider this role as
growing and stable, with the numerator reflecting the
weighted shares of anticipated workforce increases
and decreases and the denominator aggregating
total workforce shares across all anticipated states
(growing, declining and stable). The churn metric,
similarly, adopts absolute values for workforce
decreases. These methodologies aim to present
an objective, scalable perspective on workforce
transformations at the role and industry level.

Reweighted metrics
International Labour Organization (ILO) data were
then used to translate the forecast fractional net
growth for each role into estimates of the number
of jobs that will be created or displaced between
2025 and 2030. ILO estimates of the number
of employees in each occupational category of
ISCO08 level 2 were used as a basis for the number
of employees working at the time of publication.
To account for the absence of China-specific data
in the ILO’s employment-by-occupation dataset,
a China employment multiplier was calculated
based on the share of China’s employment figure
in global employment figure and applied under the
assumption that China’s labour market structure
aligns with global patterns. To approximate the
number of employees in each occupation of
the jobs taxonomy used in the Future of Jobs
Survey, the jobs taxonomy (a modified and
extended version of the O*NET SOC occupational
classification) was mapped to the ISCO08
occupational taxonomy used in the ILO data by
modifying and extending the map developed by the
U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, which connects
SOC level 4 and ISCO08 level 4. Estimates of
present employment were then multiplied by the
fractional net growth estimates obtained from the
survey, to estimate net growth worldwide in units of
millions of employees.
Using this method, the Future of Jobs dataset
described in Chapter 2 corresponds to 1.18
billion employees. By comparison, the ILO dataset
used in the analysis accounts for 2.18 billion
employees, and 2.76 billion employees upon
applying the China multiplier. The remaining 1.58
billion employees correspond to roles for which
the Future of Jobs Survey did not collect sufficient
data to reliably estimate net growth. Data on
employees rather than general employment was
used as organizations responding to the Future of
Jobs Survey maintain workers in formal rather than
informal employment.
The estimates of the number of employees per
sector which can be found in the Industry Profiles
are based on the full dataset of 2.18 billion
employees worldwide. This calculation is described
in the user guide to the profiles.

Attribution to jobs
To analyze the impact of specific trends on job
growth and decline, survey respondents attributed
the growth and decline of roles to macrotrends
and technology trends. Respondent’s weighted
attribution was used to allocate a fraction of job
changes to specific trends. These were then
mapped to ILO occupation data to calculate the
absolute number of jobs created and destroyed per
occupation in the next five years.

Future of Jobs Report 2025 100

To limit the potential impact of randomisation
inherent in survey data, two techniques were
employed: capping the maximum impact of a
particular trend-job combination and removing
attributions with an insufficient number of
respondents. Specifically, the total impact of a

TA B L E A 2

single trend on a job was capped at the 99th
percentile of all trend-job combinations, 1.61 million
for job increase, and 1st percentile, minus 872
thousand for job loss, and attribution pairs with
fewer than three votes were excluded, with their
impact categorized as unexplained.
