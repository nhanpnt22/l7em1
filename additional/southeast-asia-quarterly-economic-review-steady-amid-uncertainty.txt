Southeast Asian economies held up in the face
of increasing global uncertainties in the fourth
quarter of 2024, with almost all economies
achieving 5 percent growth or above in the quarter.
Vietnam continued as the region’s top-performing
economy with 7.55 percent growth, while Thailand,
the only economy in the region with -5.0 percent
growth, saw growth accelerate to 3.2 percent, its
third highest year-on-year quarterly growth for
the past five years. Indonesia experienced a slight
growth uptick and the Philippines held steady,
while growth moderated in Malaysia and Singapore
(Exhibit 1). Core growth drivers remained steady,
with investments into the region particularly strong
in the fourth quarter, while exports, output, and
consumption remained broadly stable. Regional
currencies, however, weakened against the US
dollar on expectations of an extended highinterest rate climate in the United States.1

Overall, in 2024, Southeast Asia’s economies
performed stronger than in 2023. Labor markets
were more resilient, while inflationary conditions
improved during the year. Despite this, the region
still faces challenges as it grapples with the
effects of growing global uncertainties, including
weakening global demand, rising trade tensions,
and geopolitics. Most central banks in Southeast
Asia eased rates in recent weeks, which could
stimulate the economy and help counter these
challenges. More rate cuts are likely in the near
term.
In this article, we focus on the economies of six
countries in Southeast Asia: Indonesia, Malaysia,
the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, and Vietnam.
We start by setting the scene with a regional
overview.

For the purposes of this article, most of the statistics used have been taken from countries’ national statistics offices and central banks as a
primary source. Oxford Economics has been used as a secondary source unless otherwise stated.

Macroeconomic outlook
GDP
The region’s economy held up and ended 2024
on a steady note, with all countries but Thailand
achieving 5 percent GDP growth or more in the
fourth quarter of 2024. Exports and investments
drove growth, while contributions from
consumption remained broadly stable. Vietnam
continued to be the region’s best-performing
economy, with a 7.55 percent growth. Thailand
grew from strength to strength during the year,
achieving 3.2 percent growth in the fourth quarter,
representing the third consecutive quarter of
economic growth acceleration. Indonesia saw a
very slight growth uptick, while the Philippines
kept a similar growth rate to the third quarter.
Singapore’s growth moderated to 5 percent, still
a credible expansion for a developed economy.
Malaysia’s growth moderated to 5.0 percent
from 5.3 percent in the previous quarter on the
back of a slower energy and commodities sector
performance.
Trade momentum
Trade broadly continued its robust trajectory.
Indonesia recorded stronger exports growth
in the fourth quarter, while Thailand continued
its turnaround story to achieve its strongest
exports expansion in 11 quarters. Exports in the
Philippines rebounded, having contracted in the
third quarter, while Malaysia, Singapore, and
Vietnam saw their exports growth moderate in the
fourth quarter. Overall, in 2024, Southeast Asia
experienced strong trade growth, supported by
demand from key trading partners such as China
and the United States, particularly in electronics,
which benefited from the global technology
upcycle. Imports strengthened too following an
increase in local demand for intermediate and
capital goods to support industrial production and
investment activities.
Industrial activity
Industrial activities showed mixed expansion
across the region. Indonesia and the Philippines

recorded stronger growth in the fourth quarter,
while the rest of the region grew at a slower
pace. The technology upcycle, coupled with
strong local and foreign demand in areas such
as food and beverage, mining, and transport
engineering, helped support manufacturing
output in the region. Likewise, the Purchasing
Managers’ Index (PMI) provided mixed readings.
PMI for Indonesia and the Philippines reentered
the expansionary territory for the first time in the
fourth quarter since November 2017 and June
2024, respectively, while Singapore’s PMI was at
a six-year high. Malaysia and Vietnam were in the
contractionary zone because output growth and
new orders were expected to slow as business
sentiments dampened, given the uncertain
macroeconomic conditions.
Private consumption
Private consumption strengthened in the fourth
quarter across most Southeast Asian economies.
A mix of strong labor markets, easing prices,
and, in some countries, the prevalence of policy
support measures helped boost consumption.
The Philippines and Singapore were the only two
economies that experienced a moderation in
consumption growth in the fourth quarter.
Labor
Labor markets remained resilient in the fourth
quarter, with labor demand and participation in
Southeast Asian markets having recovered to
pre-COVID-19 levels. Levels of unemployment
improved in the fourth quarter in most countries
in the region, except for Malaysia and Singapore,
where both remained unchanged but close
to the lowest level recorded in the past ten
years. New jobs continued to be added to the
markets, although job gains in some countries
were slower than in the previous quarter. While
the labor indicators may have appeared robust
overall, developing markets such as Indonesia and
the Philippines remained dominated by people
working in the informal sectors, necessitating
efforts to improve the employment rate in the
formal sector.

Prices
Inflation further eased across the region in
the fourth quarter, except for the Philippines
and Thailand, which both saw higher inflation
attributed to increases in food and energy prices.
In 2024, inflation moderated across all countries
except for Vietnam, which experienced a minor
0.1 percent increase. Prices appear to have
stabilized, with inflation rates within each
respective country’s target inflation rates or at
levels deemed acceptable.

its policy rate by 25 basis points to 6 percent
in September 2024, the first time since the
progressive hikes in February 2021. The central
banks of the Philippines and Thailand cut rates
a bit later, in October 2024. This marked the
second rate cut in 2024 for the Philippines, while
the revision was the first cut for Thailand in four
years. Other central banks were comfortable with
their prevailing positions. Growth, inflation, and
stable monetary conditions will continue to be
core considerations in determining the region’s
central banks’ assessments of their policy rates in
the future.

Currency
Southeast Asian currencies tumbled against the
US dollar in the fourth quarter, reversing gains
seen in the previous quarter. Escalating trade
tensions could result in US policy rates being
kept at the same level for longer, providing a
boost to the US dollar. The Philippines peso and
Vietnamese dong hit record lows in the fourth
quarter. Meanwhile, the Malaysian ringgit, despite
its depreciation in the fourth quarter, emerged as
one of the few currencies in Asia to strengthen in
2024.

Capital flows
In the third quarter, Southeast Asian countries
continued to build on the positive momentum from
the previous quarter. Indonesia, the Philippines,
Thailand, and Vietnam saw higher foreign direct
investment (FDI) inflow this quarter. This reflects
the region’s attractiveness as an investment
destination as businesses continue to reassess
and reconfigure their global operational and
supply chain footprints. Southeast Asia attracted
investments in sectors including automotive,
electronics, mining, and services, with each
country developing clear strength and value
propositions in specific sectors over others.

Interest rates
Bank Indonesia (BI) was the only central bank
in the region to act in the third quarter, cutting

Indonesia

Indonesia’s economic growth remained broadly
flat in the fourth quarter, with GDP expanding
5.02 percent year on year from 4.95 percent in
the previous quarter. Exports emerged stronger,
while household consumption, which contributed
to more than 50 percent of GDP, remained stable,

supported by a declining inflationary environment
and strong employment conditions (Exhibit 3).
Full-year 2024 GDP growth came in at 5.03 percent,
consistent with the years post-COVID-19 but well
behind President Prabowo’s target of 8.0 percent

GDP growth within his term until 2029.2 The central
bank, meanwhile, has not ruled out further rate
cuts in the near term to provide the economy with
another boost.

Macroeconomic outlook
GDP
Indonesia recorded 5.02 percent in GDP growth
in the fourth quarter, slightly ahead of the previous
quarter’s growth of 4.95 percent. Processing
services, trade, agriculture, construction, and
mining were the larger GDP contributors, while
transport and warehousing recorded one of the
highest growth rates this quarter. 3 Full-year 2024
GDP growth, meanwhile, came in at 5.03 percent,
similar to the 5.05 percent growth recorded in 2023
and broadly within Indonesia’s 5.0 to 6.0 percent
annual year-on-year growth range since the
COVID-19 pandemic.
Private consumption
Household consumption growth improved slightly
to 4.98 percent year on year in the fourth quarter
from 4.91 percent recorded in the third quarter.
Household consumption contributed 53.71 percent
to overall GDP, and strong holiday spending over
sectors such as food and beverages, hotels, and
transportation across air, sea, and rail helped to
prop up consumption in the fourth quarter. 4
Trade
Trade stayed resilient in the fourth quarter, with
exports recording stronger growth of 8.03 percent
year on year compared to 6.49 percent growth in
the prior quarter, while imports remained consistent
at 9.46 percent and 9.74 percent growth year on
year in the fourth and third quarters, respectively.
Overall, exports in 2024 expanded by 2.29 percent,
while imports grew by 5.31 percent. Exports of
commodities and fertilizers, machinery, and motor
vehicles contributed close to half of Indonesia’s

2

exports in 2024. On the imports front, intermediate
and capital goods to support industrial and
investment activities were among key import
products. The ASEAN region and China were
Indonesia’s top two trading partners. 5
Industrial activity
Expansion in the manufacturing sector inched
further in the fourth quarter of 2024, growing by
4.89 percent, higher than the 4.72 percent growth
in the third quarter. Demand was strong from both
local and foreign buyers, particularly in sectors
such as food and beverages and base metals,
including steel and fertilizers, as well as computers,
electronics, optics, and electrical products.6 PMI
reentered the expansionary territory in December
2024, the first time since June 2024. The December
reading came at 51.2, which saw further uplift in
January 2025 to 51.9. Growth in factory activity and
new orders have been strong in recent months as
firms raised buying activities ahead of Ramadan.
Labor
Indonesia’s National Labor Force Survey’s
latest release indicated an improvement in the
unemployment rate, which declined to 4.91 percent
in August 2024 from 5.32 percent in the same
month of 2023. The improvement was driven by
gains in sectors such as agriculture and services.7
There has been a gradual decline in unemployment
from its peak in 2020 and it is back at the preCOVID-19 levels. Moving forward, Indonesia has set
a target for 2025 to reduce unemployment to within
4.5 to 5.0 percent. 8
Inflation
Inflation moderated to 1.57 percent at the end of the
fourth quarter of 2024 from 1.84 percent recorded
at the end of the previous quarter. Soft consumer
demand, stable global energy prices, and lower
impact from weather-related food price shocks
helped to keep prices manageable.9 Food and

in the fourth quarter, while prices in the transport
services declined. Inflation has broadly been on
a declining trend post the first quarter of 2024,
with 2024 numbers coming in at 1.57 percent,
lower than the 2.61 percent recorded in 2023 and
5.51 percent attained during the high inflationary
environment in 2022.10 Moving forward, the central
bank is targeting inflation to come in the range of
1.5 to 3.5 percent in 2025.11

Financial markets
Currency
The Indonesia rupiah weakened against the
US dollar over the course of the fourth quarter,
reversing its gain from the third quarter. The
rupiah’s tepid performance mirrors the trend
seen in most parts of the region, and despite
assurance from the central bank that the currency
depreciation is under control, in mid-January 2025,
the rupiah slid to its lowest level in more than six
months. This followed a surprise cut in the policy
rate as the central bank continues to navigate
carefully to balance between stimulating economic
growth and facilitating a stable rupiah.12

Indonesia kept its policy rate constant in the
fourth quarter of 2024. However, in January 2025,
the central bank lowered its policy rate by 25 basis
points to 5.75 percent as part of a bid to further
stimulate economic growth and thereafter held
the rate steady in February 2025.13 The central
bank has not ruled out further rate cuts during the
year but emphasized that the timing depended on
global dynamics.14
Capital flows
Indonesia recorded a stellar FDI performance
in the fourth quarter of 2024, with FDI growing
by 33.3 percent year on year to US $15.11 billion
(245.8 trillion rupiah). The pace of expansion
almost doubled from the 18.6 percent growth
recorded in the third quarter. The base metals,
paper, and mining sectors accounted for almost
half of FDIs, in line with the government’s push to
accelerate the development of the commodities
sector, encouraging international manufacturers
to set up plants in the country.15 China, Hong
Kong, and Singapore, meanwhile, were the largest
sources of FDI. Overall, Indonesia’s FDI in 2024
strengthened to US $55.3 billion (900.2 trillion
rupiah), an expansion of 21 percent from 2023.16

fourth quarter—the second consecutive quarter to

quarter, while the Malaysia ringgit appreciated
by 2.7 percent in 2024 to become one of the few
currencies in Asia to have strengthened over the
year.17

Macroeconomic outlook
GDP
Malaysia’s economy saw growth moderate
to 5.0 percent in the fourth quarter, from 5.3
percent in the third quarter, driven by strong
investment activities, an increase in exports, and
sustained domestic spending. Contractions in the
commodities sector and a slower-than-expected
recovery in oil production, meanwhile, weighed
down growth during the quarter. The full-year
growth of 5.1 percent in 2024 reflected a much
stronger performance than the 3.7 percent
attained in 2023.18
The government projects growth for 2025 to be
between 4.5 to 5.5 percent.19 The outlook, however,
is subjected to lingering risks including an
economic slowdown with major trading partners,
investment restrictions, and lower-than-expected
commodity production.20
Private consumption
Private consumption growth was sustained in
the fourth quarter, increasing by 4.9 percent, 0.1
percent higher than the growth recorded in the
prior quarter. Strong labor market conditions and
policy support measures, such as civil sector pay
hikes and minimum wage revisions, helped prop
up consumption activities.21
Trade
Following a very strong performance in the third
quarter of 2024, trade activities moderated in
the fourth quarter. Exports grew slower at 7.3

percent in the fourth quarter from 7.8 percent
recorded in the previous quarter, while imports
grew 5.3 percent this quarter compared to 20.8
percent growth in the third quarter. Continued
strong performance in the electrical and
electronics (E&E) sector helped drive exports,
while imports saw a moderation in domestic
demand for capital and intermediate goods
used to support investment activities and the
production of manufactured exports.22 Trade
results from January 2025 showed that Malaysia’s
trade continues to expand, marking the 13th
consecutive month of trade growth, albeit at a
slower pace following global uncertainties, with
concerns over the potential impact of US trade
protectionism.23
Industrial activity
Manufacturing output grew 4.4 percent in the
fourth quarter, slower than the 5.6 percent growth
experienced in the third quarter, which then
also was the strongest quarterly performance
in 2024. While E&E continued to drive growth,
slower transport manufacturing activities were
seen in the fourth quarter.24 PMI eased in the
quarter from 49.5 in October to 48.6 in December
2024, although it strengthened slightly to 48.7
in January 2025 to snap a declining streak since
May 2024. At the start of 2025, manufacturing
sector conditions remained muted and within the
contractionary zone as production and new orders
stayed moderated.25
Labor
Malaysia’s unemployment rate kept constant at
3.2 percent in the fourth quarter, continuing to be
anchored low and at pre-COVID-19 levels. Labor
demand strengthened, with overall employment
increasing by another 100,000 in the fourth
quarter to 16.8 million. The labor participation rate
bettered the previous quarter’s historic high and

grew by a further 0.1 percent to 70.6 percent in
the fourth quarter of 2024.26
Inflation
Inflation declined to 1.8 percent in the fourth
quarter, 0.1 percent lower than the previous
quarter. Promotions in the mobile communications
services segment and deflation in petrol prices
helped to ease inflation. Food and beverages
prices, though, rose by 2.5 percent, faster than the
1.6 percent experienced in the previous quarter.
Overall, 2024 inflation came to 1.8 percent, lower
than 2.5 percent in 2023. The central bank
expects 2025 inflation to remain manageable as
global costs ease and domestic demand remains
stable, with the Ministry of Finance projecting the
inflation rate to be between 2.0 and 3.5 percent.27

Financial markets
Currency
The ringgit depreciated by 7.6 percent against the
US dollar in the fourth quarter of 2024, having
appreciated in the previous quarter. Overall, in
2024, the currency appreciated by 2.7 percent
against the dollar, becoming one of the few

currencies in Asia to have strengthened. The
central bank believes the ringgit will continue to
be supported in the medium term, as it remains
optimistic about its macroeconomic prospects
with the implementation of ongoing economic
structural reforms.28
Policy rate
The central bank opted to maintain the policy rate
at 3 percent at its most recent Monetary Policy
Committee (MPC) meetings in November 2024
and January 2025. It believes the decision is
consistent with its assessment of inflation, which
it expects to remain manageable, and the positive
economic growth prospects in the near term.29
Capital flows
Malaysia’s FDI inflows stood at 18.4 billion ringgit
(US $4.16 billion) in the fourth quarter from 14.5
billion ringgit in the preceding quarter, and was
the highest quarterly FDI inflow in 2024. The
services sector continued to be the largest
beneficiary of FDI in Malaysia, predominantly in
the information and communication and finance
subsectors, followed by the manufacturing sector,
with Hong Kong, Singapore, and the United States
being the country’s top investors. 30

The Philippines

The Philippines’ economy maintained its growth
momentum in the fourth quarter to expand at
5.2 percent, equal to that of the previous quarter.
Consumption, which historically contributed to
about 70 percent of GDP, grew slower during
the quarter, while exports recorded a rebound
(Exhibit 5). The labor market was robust, with

unemployment at its lowest level since 2005. Fullyear growth, though, landed at 5.6 percent, below
the government’s 6.0 to 6.5 percent growth target
for 2024. Extreme weather events, geopolitical
tensions, and subdued global demand were
impediments to stronger growth in 2024.

Southeast Asia quarterly economic review: Steady amid uncertainty

12

For 2025, the central bank has set a GDP growth
target of between 6 to 8 percent. Inflation is
expected to remain in check, catalyzing stronger
consumption in the year ahead, which together with
investments is expected to fuel the economy in
2025.

Macroeconomic outlook
GDP
The Philippines’ economy recorded growth of 5.2
percent in the fourth quarter of 2024, similar to
that seen in the third quarter. On a sector level, the
services sector grew stronger this quarter at 6.7
percent compared to 6.3 percent in the previous
quarter, while industrial growth moderated to
4.4 percent from 5.0 percent in the third quarter.
The agriculture sector experienced its third
round of contraction, following severe weather
and typhoons, which disrupted crop production,
livestock, and fishing activities. The fourth
quarter’s outcome brought the country’s 2024 GDP
expansion to 5.6 percent, missing the government’s
target of 6.0 to 6.5 percent for 2024. 31
Private consumption
Household consumption grew 4.7 percent year on
year, slower than the 5.1 percent growth attained in
the previous quarter, despite the typical uptick in
demand experienced ahead of the holiday season.
Overall growth of 4.8 percent for 2024 also marked
a slowdown from the 5.6 percent growth in 2023. 32
Powerful storms battered the Philippines in the
second half of 2024, stoking food prices as farm
output was disrupted, thus impacting demand and
spending on travel and leisure activities. 33
Trade
Having contracted by 1.0 percent in the previous
quarter, exports rebounded to a record 3.2 percent
year-on-year growth in the fourth quarter. The
growth was driven by services exports, which

31

increased 13.5 percent and helped tame the 4.6
percent contraction in goods exports. Full-year
overall exports still grew faster at 3.4 percent year
on year in 2024 compared to 1.4 percent in 2023.
Fourth quarter imports, meanwhile, grew by 3.1
percent in the fourth quarter, which is slower than
the prior quarter, but did not derail the full-year
numbers, as imports grew by 4.3 percent in 2024
compared to 1.0 percent in 2023. 34
Industrial activity
Manufacturing production in the Philippines
improved in the fourth quarter of 2024, growing
by 3.1 percent from 2.8 percent year on year in
the third quarter. This marked the first uptick in
manufacturing output growth since the start of
2024. 35 Manufacturing PMI, too, rose to 54.3 in
December 2024, the highest recorded factory
expansion since November 2017, on the back of
increased output and an increased number of new
orders. 36
Labor
The labor market improved for its sixth consecutive
month in December 2024, with the Philippines’
unemployment rate declining to 3.1 percent. This
brought the overall 2024 unemployment rate to
3.8 percent, the lowest recorded since 2005. 37
The services sector had the largest share of
the employed force at 60.5 percent, followed
by the agriculture and industrial sectors at 21.3
percent and 18.3 percent, respectively. A resilient
and robust job market provides hope for higher
consumer spending in 2025, which will ultimately
help boost the country’s economy. 38
Inflation
After seeing its lowest inflation in 2024 at the end
of the third quarter, the Philippines experienced
three consecutive months of faster price increases
and recorded 2.9 percent inflation in December.
Larger increases in food and utilities were seen in

December. For 2024, the Philippines’ inflation
averaged 3.2 percent, within the central bank’s
2.0 to 4.0 percent target for 2024, and it marked
the first time since 2021 that the country has
achieved its inflation target. 39

Financial markets
Currency
The Philippines’ peso reversed its third-quarter
gain and depreciated in the fourth quarter to hit a
historic record low of 59 peso per US dollar mark
in December 2024. The peso was one of Asia’s
worst-performing currencies in 2024 and has
been under pressure since the central bank cut
rates in the fourth quarter of 2024. Economists
predict further weakening of the currency,
possibly breaching the 60 peso per US dollar
mark by the middle of 2025. 40
Policy rate
The central bank cut its policy rate twice in the
fourth quarter of 2024, as the Philippines sought
to stimulate its weakening economy. In October
2024, the central bank reduced its policy rate

by 25 basis points, thereafter another 25 basis
points to 5.75 percent in December 2024. 41 At
its latest policy meeting in February 2025, the
central bank kept policy rates constant as it takes
stock of and recalibrates against uncertainties
over global trade policies. Further rate cuts of at
least 50 basis points later in 2025 cannot be ruled
out. 42
Capital inflows
Foreign investment approvals experienced a
soft fourth quarter, coming in at US $1.0 billion
(57.7 billion pesos), less than half attained in the
previous quarter and 85.4 percent lower than
during the same quarter in 2023. Despite this, the
strong momentum seen in the first three quarters
of 2024 enabled the Philippines to register US
$33.77 billion in foreign investment approvals
in 2024, a 32.7 percent expansion compared
to 2023. South Korea was its largest investor,
contributing almost half of total investments,
while, from a sector perspective, manufacturing,
electricity, and transportation were core
beneficiaries of investments. 43

Singapore

Singapore’s economic growth moderated in the
fourth quarter to 5.0 percent year on year, from 5.7
percent in the previous quarter, although, when
taken in totality, the economy performed strongly
in 2024 as pace of growth more than doubled
from 2023. Wholesale trade, manufacturing, and
finance and insurance continued to be key growth

engines in the fourth quarter. Growth moderated in
private consumption, exports, and industrial output
in the quarter, although the labor market remained
resilient and inflation continued to ease. (Exhibit 6).

in the economy in the near term. The economy is
expected to see growth ease by between 1 to 3
percent in 2025.

Macroeconomic outlook
GDP
Singapore’s economy expanded by 5.0 percent
year on year in the fourth quarter of 2024,
moderating from the previous quarter’s 5.7
percent growth, which was the strongest quarterly
expansion since 2022. All sectors expanded
during the fourth quarter, except for retail trade,
administration and support services, and food and
beverages, while wholesale trade, manufacturing,
and finance and insurance were key growth
engines, contributing to 70 percent of fourthquarter growth.
For the full-year 2024, the economy grew by
4.4 percent, accelerating from the 1.8 percent
expansion in 2023. 44 Looking forward, the
economy is forecast to grow between 1 to 3
percent in 2025. 45
Price consumption
Private consumption growth moderated to 4.8
percent year on year in the fourth quarter, from 6.9
percent in the previous quarter. Transport, health,
and miscellaneous goods and services categories
formed the higher growth expenditure segments
during the quarter. 46
Trade
Singapore’s total merchandise trade grew faster at
6.8 percent in the fourth quarter from 5.3 percent
in the prior quarter, while growth in the total
services trade moderated to 7.4 percent year on
year from 10.8 percent in the third quarter. Exports

experienced a slower fourth quarter, with growth
weakening in both merchandise and services
exports. Non-oil domestic exports (NODX), as a
reference for production and Singapore’s trade,
saw growth moderate to 2.4 percent in the fourth
quarter year on year, from 9.0 percent in the
previous quarter. Electronics NODX grew slightly
slower, but the nonelectronics segment declined
significantly, decelerating by 0.7 percent in the
fourth quarter from 7.0 percent growth in the prior
quarter.
The year still turned out to be a positive year on
the trade front, with 2024 merchandise trade
rebounding from a –11.7 percent contraction in
2023 to 6.6 percent growth, while services trade
growth almost doubled from 4.8 percent in 2023
to 8.6 percent in 2024. Electronics, transport
services, and financial services were the stronger
performing sectors. 47
Industrial activity
The manufacturing sector expanded by 7.4 percent
in the fourth quarter year on year, moderating
from 11.2 percent recorded in the previous quarter.
Growth was mainly led by higher output in the
electronics and transport engineering sectors,
while output in biomedical, precision engineering,
and chemicals sectors contracted in the fourth
quarter. Overall, 2024 was a positive year for the
manufacturing sector, which grew 4.3 percent
in 2024, reversing the 4.2 contraction recorded
in 2023. All manufacturing sectors saw output
expansion in 2024, except for the biomedical
manufacturing segment. 48 Manufacturing
PMI hit a six-year high at the end of the fourth
quarter, marking the 16th consecutive month of
expansion as December 2024’s PMI came in at
51.1. 49 Demand is expected to remain resilient in the
manufacturing sector in the near term, although

overhanging clouds remain given uncertainty on the
Trump administration’s tariff policies. January 2025
could be an indicator of the road ahead. PMI slipped
by 0.2 points to 50.9, mirroring the trend in the
region where most economies recorded lower PMI
in January 2025 than in December 2024. 50
Labor
Singapore’s labor market remained broadly
resilient, with the fourth quarter unemployment rate
unchanged from the previous quarter, at 1.9 percent.
The market experienced 12,900 new jobs, mainly
from the services sector, although this is less than
the previous quarter’s gains of 24,900 new jobs.
Retrenchments inched slightly higher, 550 more
than the third quarter. 51 Hiring expectations in the
first quarter of 2025 are positive but slightly weaker
compared to the same period in 2024, with selected
sectors such as transport, logistics, and automotive
expecting better prospects. 52
Inflation
Inflation further eased to 1.6 percent on a year-onyear basis in the fourth quarter of 2024 as price
inflation continues to moderate since the fourth
quarter of 2022. The overall rate of inflation in 2024,
meanwhile, halved to 2.4 percent, compared to
4.8 percent in 2023. Healthcare costs climbed the
most in 2024, on the back of more costly outpatient
and hospital services and health insurance, with
recreation and culture and housing and utilities
rounding up the top three. 53 Moving forward, the
central bank expects inflation to land within the
region of 1.5 to 2.5 percent. 54

50

Financial markets
Currency
After hitting a ten-year high against the US dollar
in the third quarter of 2024, the Singapore dollar
subsequently weakened by 6.2 percent in the fourth
quarter. The weakening of the Singapore dollar
is in line with regional currencies as escalation in
trade tensions could lead to increased inflation,
and US rates that could stay higher than longer, a
boost for the US dollar. In January 2025, Singapore
announced an easing of its monetary policy and the
Singapore dollar has since strengthened slightly by
about 1 percent. 55
Policy rate
The Monetary Authority of Singapore kept its policy
stance unchanged in its policy meeting in October
2024, but in January 2025 announced an easing of
its monetary policy stance, the first time in nearly
five years. 56 Amid expectations for slower growth
in 2025 and with inflation expected to ease, the
central bank plans to slightly reduce the slope of
the Singapore dollar nominal effective exchange
rate (S$NEER) policy band, while the width of the
policy band and level at which it is centered remain
unchanged. 57
Capital inflows
Singapore recorded FDI net inflows of US $45.6
billion (60.8 billion Singapore dollars) in the fourth
quarter of 2024, an uptick of US $12.1 billion
compared to the prior quarter. 58

growth accelerated. Strong investments, exports,
and consumption helped drive growth, while
industrial production continued to hold steady
(Exhibit 7). Private consumption strengthened

marginally, although inflation increased and the

Macroeconomic outlook
GDP
Thailand’s economy grew by 3.2 percent in
the fourth quarter, faster than the 3.0 percent
growth in the second quarter, supported by
stronger investments, exports performance, and
consumption. The services sector continued to
drive growth, with the accommodation and food
services and transportation and storage segments
attaining the highest growth in the services cluster
at 10.2 and 9.0 percent, respectively. Construction
accelerated to 18.3 percent, having rebounded in
the previous quarter. Manufacturing growth inched
moderately stronger, increasing 0.2 percent, while
the agriculture sector reversed four quarters of
contraction to expand by 1.2 percent in the fourth
quarter.
The fourth-quarter result represented the third
straight quarter of growth for Thailand and enabled
the country to record stronger growth in 2024,
at 2.5 percent, compared to 2.0 percent in 2023.
Meanwhile, economic growth in 2025 is projected
to be within the range of 2.3 to 3.3 percent, driven
by expansion in private consumption, government
expenditure, merchandise exports, and tourism
sector recovery. 59
Private consumption
Private consumption growth in the fourth quarter
increased marginally to 3.4 percent from 3.3
percent in the previous quarter. Most expenditure
categories increased in the fourth quarter,
supported by the government’s economic stimulus
in the form of cash transfers and an improvement
in consumer confidence levels.60
Trade
The exports sector continued its turnaround story,
growing by 10.6 percent in the fourth quarter, the
highest rate in 11 quarters and accelerating from
59

8.9 percent growth attained in the previous quarter.
Electronics exports such as computers, computer
parts and machinery, and rubber were key growth
drivers. Imports continued its double-digit
growth, albeit slower at 10.7 percent compared
to 11.3 percent in the previous quarter. All import
categories saw an expansion, which supported
exports and consumption activities. For 2024, both
exports and imports expanded, at 5.8 and 6.3
percent, respectively, with a trade surplus of US
$19.3 billion (678.2 trillion). 61
Industrial activity
The manufacturing sector continued to grow in
the fourth quarter, albeit at a slower rate of 0.2
percent compared to 0.3 percent in the previous
quarter. This marked the third consecutive quarter
of growth for the sector, which has seen almost
continual contractions for the past three years
before finally turning a corner in the second
quarter of 2024. The electronics sector upcycle
helped Thailand’s manufacturing sector, with
computers and machinery recording double-digit
growth in the fourth quarter, along with apparel
manufacturing. Overall, in 2024, production
recorded a smaller contraction of 0.5 percent
compared to the 2.7 percent decline in 2023.62
PMI remained in the expansionary territory in the
fourth quarter and ended higher in December at
51.4 compared to September’s reading of 50.4.
An increase of new orders, the highest since May
2023, helped boost December numbers.63 The
sector, however, registered a slight deterioration
in business conditions in January 2025, with PMI
declining to 49.6 on the back of lower output and
new orders.64
Labor
The unemployment rate in the fourth quarter
continued to fall to 0.88 from 1.02 percent in the
third quarter.65 Although the number bodes well
on the surface, a deeper look at recent data from

the National Economic and Social Development
Council (NESDC) reveals an underlying challenge
around rising unemployment among university
graduates, who now form the largest group of the
unemployed population.66
Inflation
Inflation increased in the fourth quarter to 1.0
percent from 0.6 percent in the previous quarter.
Higher core inflation, as well as an increase in
energy prices due to the low base effects from
prior year’s government subsidies, drove inflation
higher this quarter. Inflation in 2024 was recorded
at 0.4 percent, lower than 1.2 and 6.1 percent
recorded in 2023 and 2022, respectively. Inflation
for 2025, meanwhile, is expected to be stable in
the range of 0.5 to 1.5 percent.67

Financial markets
Currency
After rallying by 12.0 percent in the third quarter,
and at one point reaching its highest level in 31
months against the greenback, the Thai baht
depreciated by 5.41 percent in the fourth quarter.
Escalating concerns about tariffs from the United
States have supported the strengthening of the
dollar, and although the baht has strengthened by
2.13 percent against the US dollar in the first

two months of 2025, it is likely to remain under
pressure. It is forecasted to depreciate to 35.50 to
the US dollar by the end of 2025.68
Policy rate
In the fourth quarter, the Bank of Thailand (BOT)
cut its policy rate by 25 basis points to 2.25
percent in October 2024, and thereafter kept the
rate constant coming out of its December 2024
policy meeting. The move in October represented
the bank’s first rate cut in over four years and
is hoped to alleviate the debt servicing burden
of borrowers and, at the same time, provide
an impetus to revive the country’s sluggish
economy. 69 In February 2025, the policy rate was
further cut to 2.0 percent.70
Capital inflows
In the fourth quarter, Thailand recorded an FDI
inflow of US $8.51 billion (285.5 billion baht), an
uptick from US $6.58 billion received in the third
quarter. This brought the FDI value for 2024 to
US $24.79 billion (32.1 billion baht), a significant
increase of 25.5 percent from 2023. E&E
manufacturing, digital industry, and machinery
and vehicles manufacturing were key to driving
FDI in 2024, accounting for 70.6 percent of FDI
received.71

Vietnam’s GDP grew 7.55 percent in the fourth
quarter of 2024, its fastest quarterly growth in the
past two years. The strong fourth-quarter growth
enabled Vietnam’s economy to expand by 7.09
percent in 2024, surpassing the government’s
target of 7.0 percent and stronger than 2023’s
GDP growth of 5.05 percent.72 Strong exports and
72

robust foreign investment inflows, coupled with
growth in industrial output that ended a record
high over the past four years, helped propel growth
in 2024. Consumption continued to improve as
inflation eased, supported by the strength in the
labor market (Exhibit 8).

For 2025, the government has set an ambitious
GDP growth target of 8 percent, although
economists exercise caution about Vietnam’s
ability to meet its planned growth trajectory, given
uncertainty surrounding the policies of the Trump
administration on Vietnam, with exports and FDIs
at greater risk of adverse impact.73

Macroeconomic outlook
GDP
Vietnam attained 7.55 percent in year-on-year
GDP growth in the fourth quarter, stronger than
the revised 7.43 percent growth recorded in the
third quarter, marking the third straight quarter
of accelerated growth in 2024. The services
sector helped prop growth, following a strong
contribution from trade and tourism activities.
The solid fourth-quarter performance enabled
Vietnam’s economy to expand by 7.09 percent in
2024 and surpass the government’s target of 7.0
percent for the year. The services sector was the
primary growth driver in 2024, contributing almost
half of the year’s growth, while the industrial and
construction sector contributed 45.17 percent.74
Private consumption
Private consumption rose by 7.54 percent year
on year in the fourth quarter as consumption
recovered, having expanded by 7.02 percent in
the third quarter and 6.58 percent in the second
quarter. Retail sales also saw positive traction,
growing 9.3 percent year on year in the fourth
quarter, ending the year with 9.0 percent growth
overall over 2023.75
Trade
Exports of goods saw slower growth of 11.5
percent in the fourth quarter compared to
the revised 15.9 percent year-on-year growth
in the previous quarter. Among key exports

segments, exports of mobile phones shrank, while
electronics, textiles and footwear, and machinery
saw stronger momentum. Overall exports for
2024 experienced a 14.3 percent uptick over the
previous year, with a goods trade surplus of US
$24.77 billion (lower than US $28.4 billion in 2023).
The United States was Vietnam’s biggest export
market, while China emerged as Vietnam’s top
import partner.76 It remains to be seen if Vietnam
can avoid incurring trade tariffs under the new US
administration. Reuters reported that Vietnam’s
trade surplus with the United States hit a record
high in 2024 at US $123.46 billion, behind only
China, the European Union, and Mexico.77
Industrial activity
Growth in industrial activity decelerated to 7.9
percent in the fourth quarter from 9.59 percent
in the third quarter. Despite this, growth for 2024
came in strong at 8.4 percent, a record high over
the past four years. Manufacturing of rubber and
plastics, furniture, and motor vehicles saw the
fastest growth of more than 20 percent in 2024.78
Meanwhile, PMI experienced a declining trend
in the fourth quarter, after a rebound in October
after typhoon Yagi, ending the year slightly in the
contractionary zone at 49.8. Slower growth was
experienced in output growth and new orders
as business sentiment slightly dampened, partly
driven by uncertainty surrounding tariff policies
from the United States.79
Labor
The labor and employment situation in the fourth
quarter showed broad signs of improvement.
The unemployment rate in the fourth quarter of
2024 continued to fall, albeit marginally to 2.22
percent from 2.24 percent and 2.29 percent
in the third and second quarters, respectively.
Unemployment for 2024 came at 2.24 percent,
down 0.04 percentage points compared to 2023.
This was despite an increase in the labor force,

the dong currency under pressure against the

Prices
Inflation continued to ease in the fourth quarter
to 2.87 percent year on year, compared to
3.48 percent recorded in the third quarter. The
continued easing enabled inflation to be kept to
3.63 percent in 2024, lower than the government’s
target of 4.0 to 4.5 percent, albeit slightly higher
than the 3.5 percent inflation recorded in 2023. 81
For 2025, Vietnam’s National Assembly has set a

Policy rate
The central bank kept the policy rate constant at

The Vietnamese dong closed 2024 at a record
low against the US dollar, having depreciated
by 2.5 percent in the fourth quarter, reversing
its appreciation against the US dollar from the
previous quarter. In the first two months of 2025,
the dong continued to remain weak against the
greenback, as escalating tariff threats from the
United States boosted the dollar. Trade-reliant

Vietnam’s disbursed FDI recorded a 9.4 percent

The processing and manufacturing industry
obtained the lion’s share of FDI commitments at
66.9 percent, while real estate accounted for a
16.5 percent share. Vietnam receives investments
from 114 countries and territories in total, with
Singapore contributing the largest share at 26.7
percent, followed by South Korea with a 20.7
percent share, and China, Hong Kong, and Japan
rounding off the top five investors. 86

Southeast Asia quarterly economic review: Steady amid uncertainty

In the spotlight

Navigating geo-economic challenges in Southeast Asia
Southeast Asian economies in the main held
steady in 2024 and look to do so in 2025.
However, while global trade integration levels
remain high, a reconfiguration of supply chains
and trade, coupled with geopolitical pressures,
could challenge their resilience and derail the
economic linkages and prosperity that Southeast
Asia has built over the years. The region needs to
act to counter this. To successfully navigate the
increasingly complex geo-economic environment,
countries could identify key watch points and
adopt certain strategies.

Watch points
Southeast Asian countries face risks arising
from recent global and regional policies and
pronouncements. Six geo-economic watch points
are of particular relevance for countries in the
region:
— A potential scaling up of direct tariffs on
produce type, trade surpluses, and perceived
lack of reciprocity and circumvention of
existing tariffs
— A redirection of supply chains as multinational
companies shift from exposed markets,
creating risks and opportunities due to
diverted overcapacity, which will affect regional
industries

— Expanding export controls around access
to and transit of critical and emerging
technologies in the region
— Evolving investment screening regimens
that could affect the ability of companies in
Southeast Asia to pursue overseas investments
— Scrutiny of critical infrastructure such as ports
in terms of access and ownership
— Regional growth trajectory as escalating trade
tensions may more broadly dampen economic
prospects for ASEAN economies with high
trade dependence

Strategies
Bearing these watch points in mind, policymakers
and business leaders in Southeast Asia could
consider three approaches to take to remain
resilient:
Keeping a trifocal lens: This involves acting on
an affirmative trade and connectivity agenda that
starts in Southeast Asia, extends across Asia, and
expands to the rest of the world. Trade agreements
(such as the ASEAN Trade in Goods Agreement or
the Digital Economy Framework Agreement) and
infrastructure investment strategies—particularly

24

for transport that can support trade flows—could
help catalyze this agenda. 87
Calibrating strategy: Business leaders and
policymakers in Southeast Asian countries could
carefully assess their strategies and responses in
light of a sometimes contradictory host of factors
in a global environment of protectionism. These
strategies can be summed up by the acronym,
“INDRA” (Exhibit 9).
Building geopolitical resilience: Countries and
companies could look to foster geopolitical
resilience in three domains:88
— Insight: Policymakers, while honing their own
sources of insights and early warning systems,
could also share them with local companies that
may not have the resources to make their own
insights. 89
— Oversight: Companies in Southeast Asia could
take a critical overview by understanding their
supply chains with increased granularity and
how their R&D is configured.90

— Foresight: Times are uncertain but
opportunities amid the volatility are there for
countries that stay alert to possibilities.91

Southeast Asian economies showed resilience,
improved inflationary conditions, and higher FDI
in the fourth quarter of 2024, despite global
uncertainties, which led to stronger performances
for the overall year than in 2023. However, with
the ongoing effects of geopolitical pressures,
along with weakening global demand and rising
trade tensions facing the region, central banks
appear to remain prepared to counter these types
of challenges in 2025, such as by easing rates to
stimulate the economy. Going forward, countries
and companies in Southeast Asia could identify
watch points and consider strategies to bolster
resilience amid geo-economic volatility and
maintain the prosperity achieved over the past few
decades.
