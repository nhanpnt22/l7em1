The state of AI in early 2024:
Gen AI adoption spikes and
starts to generate value

May 2024

As generative AI adoption accelerates, survey
respondents report measurable benefits and
increased mitigation of the risk of inaccuracy.
A small group of high performers lead the way.
This article is a collaborative effort by Alex Singla, Alexander Sukharevsky, Lareina Yee, and
Michael Chui, with Bryce Hall, representing views from QuantumBlack, AI by McKinsey and
McKinsey Digital.

If 2023 was the year the world discovered generative AI (gen
AI), 2024 is the year organizations truly began using—and
deriving business value from—this new technology. In the latest
McKinsey Global Survey on AI, 65 percent of respondents report
that their organizations are regularly using gen AI, nearly double
the percentage from our previous survey just ten months ago.
Respondents’ expectations for gen AI’s impact remain as high as
they were last year, with three-quarters predicting that gen AI will
lead to significant or disruptive change in their industries in the
years ahead.
Organizations are already seeing material benefits from gen AI
use, reporting both cost decreases and revenue jumps in the
business units deploying the technology. The survey also provides
insights into the kinds of risks presented by gen AI—most notably,
inaccuracy—as well as the emerging practices of top performers to
mitigate those challenges and capture value.

AI adoption surges
Interest in generative AI has also brightened the spotlight on a broader set of AI capabilities. For
the past six years, AI adoption by respondents’ organizations has hovered at about 50 percent.
This year, the survey finds that adoption has jumped to 72 percent (Exhibit 1). And the interest
is truly global in scope. Our 2023 survey found that AI adoption did not reach 66 percent in any
region; however, this year more than two-thirds of respondents in nearly every region say their
organizations are using AI.1 Looking by industry, the biggest increase in adoption can be found in
professional services.2

In 2017, the definition for AI adoption was using AI in a core part of the organization’s business or at scale. In 2018 and 2019, the definition was embedding at
least 1 AI capability in business processes or products. Since 2020, the definition has been that the organization has adopted AI in at least 1 function.

Organizations based in Central and South America are the exception, with 58 percent of respondents working for organizations
based in Central and South America reporting AI adoption.
Includes respondents working for organizations focused on human resources, legal services, management consulting, market
research, R&D, tax preparation, and training.

Also, responses suggest that companies are now using AI in more parts of the business. Half of
respondents say their organizations have adopted AI in two or more business functions, up from
less than a third of respondents in 2023 (Exhibit 2).

Gen AI adoption is most common in the functions where it can create the most value
Most respondents now report that their organizations—and they as individuals—are using gen AI.
Sixty-five percent of respondents say their organizations are regularly using gen AI in at least one
business function, up from one-third last year. The average organization using gen AI is doing so
in two functions, most often in marketing and sales and in product and service development—
two functions in which previous research determined that gen AI adoption could generate the
most value3—as well as in IT (Exhibit 3). The biggest increase from 2023 is found in marketing
and sales, where reported adoption has more than doubled. Yet across functions, only two use
cases, both within marketing and sales, are reported by 15 percent or more of respondents.

Gen AI also is weaving its way into respondents’ personal lives. Compared with 2023,
respondents are much more likely to be using gen AI at work and even more likely to be using
gen AI both at work and in their personal lives (Exhibit 4). The survey finds upticks in gen AI use
across all regions, with the largest increases in Asia–Pacific and Greater China. Respondents at
the highest seniority levels, meanwhile, show larger jumps in the use of gen Al tools for work and
outside of work compared with their midlevel-management peers. Looking at specific industries,
respondents working in energy and materials and in professional services report the largest
increase in gen AI use.

Investments in gen AI and analytical AI are beginning to create value
The latest survey also shows how different industries are budgeting for gen AI. Responses
suggest that, in many industries, organizations are about equally as likely to be investing more
than 5 percent of their digital budgets in gen AI as they are in nongenerative, analytical-AI
solutions (Exhibit 5). Yet in most industries, larger shares of respondents report that their
organizations spend more than 20 percent on analytical AI than on gen AI. Looking ahead,
most respondents—67 percent—expect their organizations to invest more in AI over the next
three years.
Where are those investments paying off? For the first time, our latest survey explored the
value created by gen AI use by business function. The function in which the largest share of
respondents report seeing cost decreases is human resources. Respondents most commonly
report meaningful revenue increases (of more than 5 percent) in supply chain and inventory
management (Exhibit 6). For analytical AI, respondents most often report seeing cost benefits
in service operations—in line with what we found last year—as well as meaningful revenue
increases from AI use in marketing and sales.

Looking ahead, most respondents—
67 percent—expect their
organizations to invest more in
AI over the next three years.

The state of AI in early 2024: Gen AI adoption spikes and starts to generate value

McKinsey commentary

Alex Singla
Senior partner and global coleader of QuantumBlack, AI by McKinsey
In 2024, generative AI (gen AI) is no longer a novelty. Nearly two-thirds of respondents to
our survey report that their organizations are regularly using gen AI, nearly double what our
previous survey found just ten months ago, and four in ten are using gen AI in more than
two business functions. The technology’s potential is no longer in question. And while most
organizations are still in the early stages of their journeys with gen AI, we are beginning to get
a picture of what works and what doesn’t in implementing—and generating actual value with—
the technology.
One thing we’ve learned: the business goal must be paramount. In our work with clients, we
ask them to identify their most promising business opportunities and strategies and then
work backward to potential gen AI applications. Leaders must avoid the trap of pursuing tech
for tech’s sake. The greatest rewards also will go to those who are not afraid to think big. As
we’ve observed, the leading companies are the ones that are focusing on reimagining entire
workflows with gen AI and analytical AI rather than simply seeking to embed these tools into
their current ways of working.
For that to be effective, leaders must be ready to manage change at every step along the
way. And they should expect that change to be constant: enterprises will need to design a
gen AI stack that is robust, cost-efficient, and scalable for years to come. They’ll also need
to draw on leaders from throughout the organization. Realizing profit-and-loss impact from
gen AI requires close partnership with HR, finance, legal, and risk to constantly readjust the
resourcing strategies and productivity expectations.

Inaccuracy: The most recognized and experienced risk of gen AI use
As businesses begin to see the benefits of gen AI, they’re also recognizing the diverse risks
associated with the technology. These can range from data management risks such as data
privacy, bias, or intellectual property (IP) infringement to model management risks, which tend
to focus on inaccurate output or lack of explainability. A third big risk category is security and
incorrect use. Respondents to the latest survey are more likely than they were last year to say
their organizations consider inaccuracy and IP infringement to be relevant to their use of gen AI,
and about half continue to view cybersecurity as a risk (Exhibit 7).
Conversely, respondents are less likely than they were last year to say their organizations
consider workforce and labor displacement to be relevant risks and are not increasing efforts
to mitigate them. In fact, inaccuracy—which can affect use cases across the gen AI value chain,
ranging from customer journeys and summarization to coding and creative content—is the only
risk that respondents are significantly more likely than last year to say their organizations are
actively working to mitigate.

Our previous research has found that there are several elements of governance that can help in
scaling gen AI use responsibly, yet few respondents report having these risk-related practices
in place.4 For example, just 18 percent say their organizations have an enterprise-wide council or
board with the authority to make decisions involving responsible AI governance, and only
one-third say gen AI risk awareness and risk mitigation controls are required skill sets for
technical talent.

McKinsey commentary

Lareina Yee
Senior partner, McKinsey; chair, McKinsey Technology Council
Responsible AI needs to start on day one, and there is still much work to be done in terms
of education and action. It begins with a company’s values—organizations must establish
clear principles for how they apply generative AI (gen AI) and set up guardrails to ensure its
safe implementation. For example, recognizing the importance of data security means that
company-level data and prompts remain within the enterprise walls. For that to happen, the
enterprise must have secure contracts with large language model and application providers,
as well as robust training, to make sure employees understand the difference between
enterprise tools and public tools so that code or proprietary data are not inadvertently shared
in public models.
Responsible AI also starts upstream of compliance and monitoring. Leading companies in
deploying gen AI incorporate risk practices in the development of their AI applications. This
includes ensuring that technical teams understand risk and mitigation practices. Gen AI
solutions are probabilistic models that can make mistakes or inadvertently amplify biases
in training data, so testing models before they are deployed is essential. Without a robust
testing approach, it is hard to deliver on responsible AI.
Finally, companies must develop a clear governance model to help ensure that gen AI
applications conform to governing principles. What we see in the survey results and in
our conversations with clients is a growing awareness of responsible AI and an urgency to
get it right. Still, even with increasing understanding, a little less than one-quarter of the
respondents in our survey report having a clear process to embed risk mitigation in their
solutions. Moving from awareness to action will be critical.

Bringing gen AI capabilities to bear
The latest survey also sought to understand how, and how quickly, organizations are deploying
these new gen AI tools. We have found three archetypes for implementing gen AI solutions:
takers use off-the-shelf, publicly available solutions; shapers customize those tools with
proprietary data and systems; and makers develop their own foundation models from scratch.5
Across most industries, the survey results suggest that organizations are finding off-the-shelf
offerings applicable to their business needs—though many are pursuing opportunities to
customize models or even develop their own (Exhibit 9). About half of reported gen AI uses within
respondents’ business functions are utilizing off-the-shelf, publicly available models or tools,
with little or no customization. Respondents in energy and materials, technology, and media
and telecommunications are more likely to report significant customization or tuning of publicly
available models or developing their own proprietary models to address specific business needs.

McKinsey commentary

Alexander Sukharevsky
Senior partner and global coleader of QuantumBlack, AI by McKinsey
Despite the spike in adoption of generative AI (gen AI), we are still in the experimentation
phase, with many organizations seeking relatively simple, one-step solutions. Although
it varies by industry, roughly half of our survey respondents say they are using readily
available, off-the-shelf gen AI models rather than custom-designed solutions. This is a very
natural tendency in the early days of a new technology—but it’s not a sound approach as
gen AI becomes more widely adopted. If you have it, your competitor probably has it as well.
Organizations need to ask themselves: What is our moat? The answer, in many cases, likely
will be customization.
But even there, the answer is not so simple. The spine and brain of the enterprise of the
future will rely on a well-orchestrated mix of multiple foundational models—both off-theshelf solutions and tools that have been finely tuned to the enterprise’s specific needs. In
fact, with gen AI we are moving from a binary world of “build versus buy” to one that might be
better characterized as “buy, build, and partner,” in which the most successful organizations
are those that construct ecosystems that blend proprietary, off-the-shelf, and open-source
models. Finally, leaders must understand that gen AI models generally comprise just
15 percent of any given solution. In other words: it’s not just tech. To create value,
organizations must have all the elements in place—domain reimagining abilities; relevant
skill sets (including the upskilling of nontechnical colleagues); a robust operating model;
proprietary data. It’s only when those factors are in place that organizations will be able to
unlock impact and move from experimentation to scale.

Across most industries, the survey
results suggest that organizations
are finding off-the-shelf offerings
applicable to their business
needs—though many are pursuing
opportunities to customize models
or even develop their own.

Respondents most often report that their organizations required one to four months from the
start of a project to put gen AI into production, though the time it takes varies by business
function (Exhibit 10). It also depends upon the approach for acquiring those capabilities. Not
surprisingly, reported uses of highly customized or proprietary models are 1.5 times more likely
than off-the-shelf, publicly available models to take five months or more to implement.

McKinsey commentary

Michael Chui
Partner, McKinsey Global Institute
The rapid pace of adoption of generative AI (gen AI) is reflected in the investments that
companies are making in these technologies, with similar percentages of respondents to
our survey stating that they are spending at least 5 percent of their digital budgets on gen
AI and analytical AI. That said, given the longer track record in analytical AI, larger shares of
respondents are spending more than 20 percent of their budgets on analytical AI than on
gen AI.
Organizations are also finding themselves able to deploy gen AI quickly, with the most
common project length being less than four months, reflecting the ease of using natural
language as an interface. Organizations that are doing more customization or building their
own models take longer to bring these systems online.

Gen AI high performers are excelling despite facing challenges
Gen AI is a new technology, and organizations are still early in the journey of pursuing its
opportunities and scaling it across functions. So it’s little surprise that only a small subset of
respondents (46 out of 876) report that a meaningful share of their organizations’ EBIT can
be attributed to their deployment of gen AI. Still, these gen AI leaders are worth examining
closely. These, after all, are the early movers, who already attribute more than 10 percent of their
organizations’ EBIT to their use of gen AI. Forty-two percent of these high performers say more
than 20 percent of their EBIT is attributable to their use of nongenerative, analytical AI, and they
span industries and regions—though most are at organizations with less than $1 billion in annual
revenue. The AI-related practices at these organizations can offer guidance to those looking to
create value from gen AI adoption at their own organizations.
To start, gen AI high performers are using gen AI in more business functions—an average of three
functions, while others average two. They, like other organizations, are most likely to use gen AI
in marketing and sales and product or service development, but they’re much more likely than
others to use gen AI solutions in risk, legal, and compliance; in strategy and corporate finance;
and in supply chain and inventory management. They’re more than three times as likely as
others to be using gen AI in activities ranging from processing of accounting documents
and risk assessment to R&D testing and pricing and promotions. While, overall, about half of
reported gen AI applications within business functions are utilizing publicly available models
or tools, gen AI high performers are less likely to use those off-the-shelf options than to either
implement significantly customized versions of those tools or to develop their own proprietary
foundation models.

17

Gen AI high performers are much
more likely than others to use
gen AI solutions in risk, legal,
and compliance; in strategy and
corporate finance; and in supply
chain and inventory management.

What else are these high performers doing differently? For one thing, they are paying more
attention to gen-AI-related risks. Perhaps because they are further along on their journeys,
they are more likely than others to say their organizations have experienced every negative
consequence from gen AI we asked about, from cybersecurity and personal privacy to
explainability and IP infringement. Given that, they are more likely than others to report that their
organizations consider those risks, as well as regulatory compliance, environmental impacts, and
political stability, to be relevant to their gen AI use, and they say they take steps to mitigate more
risks than others do.
Gen AI high performers are also much more likely to say their organizations follow a set of riskrelated best practices (Exhibit 11). For example, they are nearly twice as likely as others to involve
the legal function and embed risk reviews early on in the development of gen AI solutions—that
is, to “shift left.” They’re also much more likely than others to employ a wide range of other best
practices, from strategy-related practices to those related to scaling.

Bryce Hall
Associate partner
We’ve been conducting research on AI for seven years now, and the pace of innovation,
the evolution of new companies and capabilities, and the wave of investment have been
remarkable. And now we’re seeing how leading companies are capturing business value from
these often-dazzling AI and generative AI (gen AI) capabilities.
One of the most interesting findings in this year’s survey is that among the high performers
capturing the most value from gen AI, most solutions are highly customized or bespoke (what
we refer to as “shaper” or “maker” archetypes of gen AI solutions). While many companies
are finding value from off-the-shelf gen AI solutions (or the “taker” archetype), capturing the
full value of this technology often requires significant customization—for example, training
models on proprietary company and customer data or tuning models to improve performance
within a specific industry or business context.
The survey also sheds new light on high performers’ practices. High performers, for example,
are significantly more likely than others to embed testing and validation in the release process
for models, as well as to develop clear processes to iteratively improve model outputs. Over
time, these kinds of practices will become even more important, as highly customized and
bespoke solutions are the ones that will truly be differentiating for companies. Off-the-shelf
solutions, by contrast, are likely to become table stakes. Collectively, these data on practices
are consistent with our ongoing work and research on digital and AI transformations, which
shows that competitive advantage comes from building organizational and technological
capabilities to broadly innovate, deploy, and improve solutions at scale—in effect, rewiring the
business for distributed digital and AI innovation.

About the research
The online survey was in the field from February 22 to March 5, 2024, and garnered responses
from 1,363 participants representing the full range of regions, industries, company sizes,
functional specialties, and tenures. Of those respondents, 981 said their organizations had
adopted AI in at least one business function, and 878 said their organizations were regularly
using gen AI in at least one function. To adjust for differences in response rates, the data are
weighted by the contribution of each respondent’s nation to global GDP.
