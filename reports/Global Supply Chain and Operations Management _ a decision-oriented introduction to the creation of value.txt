Preface

About This Book
In everyday life, all of us take supply chain and operations management (SCOM)
decisions. If you move to a new ﬂat, location planning is ﬁrst necessary. Second, you
need a plan of how to design the overall process. This includes capacity planning,
transportation planning, and human resource planning. You also need to replenish
some items and do procurement planning. Finally, a detailed schedule for the day of
the move is needed.
Similarly, building a new house involves many SCOM decisions. Again, it starts
with location selection. If you decide to coordinate the overall process by yourself, it
is necessary to coordinate the entire supply chain of different manufacturers and
workmen. In turn, they need the detailed data of your plans and forecasted data to
plan their own process and sourcing activities. In order to avoid trafﬁc jams at the
building site, detailed coordination at the vehicle routing level is needed.
SCOM belongs to the most exciting management areas. These functionalities are
tangible and in high demand in all industries and services. This study book intends to
provide both the introduction to and advanced knowledge in the SCOM ﬁeld.
Providing readers with a working knowledge of SCOM, this textbook can be used
in core, special, and advanced classes. Therefore, the book is targeted at a broad
range of students and professionals involved in SCOM.
Special focus is directed at bridging theory and practice. Since managers use both
quantitative and qualitative methods in making their decisions, the book follows
these practical knowledge requirements. Decision-oriented and method-oriented
perspectives determine the philosophy of the book. In addition, because of the
extensive use of information technology and optimization techniques in SCOM,
we pay particular attention to this aspect.
Next, a strong global focus with more than 80 up-to-date cases and practical
examples from all over the world is a distinguishing feature of this textbook. The
case studies encompass different industries and services and consider examples of
successful and failed SCOM practices in Europe, America, Asia, Africa, and
Australia.

Finally, following the expectations of modern students and our teaching
experiences in SCOM over the past 15 years, we divided this textbook into a
hardback and an electronic supplement. In the hardback, basic theoretical concepts,
case studies, applications, and numerical examples are explained. The e-supplement
supports the hardback and provides students and teachers with additional case
studies, video streams, numerical tasks, Excel ﬁles, slides, and solutions (see Fig. 1).
The e-supplement of this book can be accessed via the URL www.global-supplychain-management.de without further registration. For course instructors, a special
area is set up that contains further material. The e-supplement is updated with
additional topics, exercises, and cases.
This second edition of our textbook consists of 17 chapters divided into four
parts:
Part I Introduction to Supply Chain and Operations Management
• Chapter 1 Basics of Supply Chain and Operations Management

•

Introductory case study
Learning objectives
Theory with practical insights and case studies
Tasks with example solutions
Key points and outlook
Additional tasks and case studies placed in e-supplement
Further supplementary materials: online tutorial, Excel ﬁles, and videos.

Each chapter starts with an introductory case study. Subsequently, major decision
areas and methods for decision support are handled. Finally, applications can be
taught based on additional case studies and numerical tasks. The summary of key
points and an outlook end each chapter. Throughout the book, practical insights are
highlighted.
The second edition contains three new chapters: “Supply Chain Risk Management and Resilience,” “Digital Supply Chain, Smart Operations, and Industry 4.0,”
and “Pricing and Revenue-Oriented Capacity Allocation.” These new chapters
provide structured knowledge on the principles, models, and technologies for managing supply chain risks and improving supply chain and operations performance
with the help of digital technologies such as Industry 4.0, additive manufacturing,
Internet of Things, advanced optimization methods, and predictive analytics. The
existing chapters have been updated and new case studies have been included. In
addition, the preface provides a guideline (Table 1) for instructors concerning how to
select and structure the materials from this book for different courses in supply chain
and operations management and with regard to different educational levels such as
general undergraduate, specialized undergraduate, and graduate courses. The companion web site for this textbook www.global-supply-chain-management.de has
been updated accordingly. In addition, the book is now supported by e-manuals

In addition, in the e-supplement, different additional materials can be found,
which are highlighted in each chapter.
The advantage of using the e-supplement is that it offers the possibility of
updating the case studies and adding additional materials more dynamically than
producing new editions of the textbook. Another advantage is to be able to keep the
hardback text short and concise. Finally, modern students are quite different from
students who studied 20 years ago: they cannot imagine the study process without
online resources.
Table 1 summarizes some recommendations for instructors concerning how to
structure courses at different teaching levels using this textbook. This structure relies
on the teaching concept in the bachelor’s specialization “Supply Chain and
Operations Management” and the master program “Global Supply Chain and
Operations Management” at the Berlin School of Economics and Law.

Basics of Supply Chain and Operations Management

Introductory Case Study: The Magic Supply Chain
and the Best Operations Manager

Santa Claus is one of the best supply chain (SC) and operations managers in the
world. He achieves incredible performance: he always delivers the right products to
the right place at the right time. This is despite highly uncertain demand and a very
complex SC with more than two billion customers.
His strategy and organization is customer-centered and strives to provide maximal satisfaction to children. The organization of his supply chain and operations
management (SCOM) is structured as follows. The customer department is responsible for processing all the letters from children all over the world. This demand data
is then given to the supply department. The supply department is responsible for
buying the desired items from suppliers worldwide. The core of the supply department is the global purchasing team which is responsible for coordinating all the
global purchasing activities.
Since many of the children’s wishes are country-speciﬁc, the regional purchasing
departments (so-called lead buyers) are distributed worldwide and build optimal SC
design. In some cases, the desired items are so speciﬁc that no supplier can be found.
For such cases, Santa Claus has established some globally located production
facilities to minimize total transportation costs and to ensure on-time delivery of
all the gifts for Christmas.

1.2 Basic Definitions and Decisions

The customer department regularly analyzes the children’s wishes. They noticed
that there are a lot of similar items which are requested each year. In order to reduce
purchasing ﬁxed costs and use scale effects, Santa Claus organized a network of
warehouses worldwide. Standard items are purchased in large batches and stored. If
the actual demand in the current year is lower than forecasted demand, this is not a
problem—these items can be used again in the following year. Since there are
millions of different items in each warehouse, Santa Claus created optimal layouts
and pick-up processes in order to ﬁnd the necessary items quickly and efﬁciently.
The SC and operations planning happens as follows. In January, Santa Claus and
the customer department start to analyze the previous year’s demand. During the ﬁrst
6 months of the year, they create a projection of future demand. The basis for such a
forecast is statistical analysis of the past and identiﬁcation of future trends (e.g., new
books, ﬁlms, toys, etc.). After that, the supply department replenishes the items and
distributes them to different warehouses. The production department schedules the
manufacturing processes. From October, the ﬁrst letters from children start to arrive.
The busy period begins. From October to December, Santa Claus needs many
assistants and enlarges the workforce.
Operations and SC execution is now responsible for bringing all the desired items
to the children. It comprises many activities: transportation, purchasing, and
manufacturing. Children are waiting impatiently to start the incoming goods inspection. No wrong pick-ups and bundles are admissible and no shortage is allowed.
More and more, children’s wishes are not about items but rather about events which
they want to happen (e.g., holidays, etc.). Service operations are also a competence
of Santa Claus. In addition, Santa Claus has established the most sustainable SC in
the world using transportation by sledges. Sometimes, letters with very unusual
wishes come in the very last moment, but Santa Claus’s SC is prepared for the
unpredictable—lastly it is a magic SC.

1.2.1

The Transformation Process, Value Creation, and Operations
Function

Operations is a function or system that transforms inputs (e.g., materials and labor)
into outputs of greater value (e.g., products or services); in other words, the
operations function is responsible for matching demand and supply (see Fig. 1.1).
The transformation process is the traditional way of thinking about operations
management in terms of planning activities. In practice, SC and operations managers
spend at least a half of their working time handling uncertainties and risks. That is
why the control function becomes more and more important for establishing feedback between the planned and real processes.
One of the basic elements in management is the creation of value added.
Identifying the ‘value’ of a product or service means understanding and specifying
what the customer is expecting to receive. We usually understand as value added any

activity in a process that is essential to deliver the service or product to the customer.
Understanding what the customer wants and does not want (to pay) are key aspects
in identifying value-added activities. The most effective process is achieved by
performing the minimal required number of value-added steps and no waste steps.
The reduction of waste and focusing on the value-added activities may increase the
efﬁciency of input resources usage and enable the most effective output of a process.
This is the ideal goal that is almost impossible to achieve in practice because of
historical development of processes in ﬁrms and continuous changes in the ﬁrms and
markets.
The operations function, along with marketing and ﬁnance, is a part of any
organization (see Fig. 1.2).
Operations management is concerned with managing resources to produce and
deliver products and services efﬁciently and effectively.
Operations management deals with the design and management of products,
processes, and services, and is comprised of four stages: sourcing, production,
distribution, and after sales.
Measurement of operations and SC performance is typically related to the
objectives triangle “costs-time-quality” (see Fig. 1.3).

1.2 Basic Definitions and Decisions

The importance of these objectives is dynamic, i.e., it has changed over time since
operations management has a long history. Over the last 60 years, a transition from a
producers’ market to a customers’ markets has occurred. This transition began in the
1960s with the increasing role of marketing in conditions of mass production of
similar products to an anonymous market. This period is known as the economy of
scale. After ﬁlling the markets with products, quality problems came to the forefront.
In the 1970s, total quality management (TQM) was established.
The increased quality triggered an individualization of customers’ requirements
in the 1980s. This was the launching point for the establishment of the economy of
the customer. This period is characterized by efforts towards optimal inventory
management and a reduction in production cycles.
In the 1980–1990s, handling high product variety challenged operations management. Another trend was the so-called speed effect. The speed of the reaction to
market changes and cutting time-to-market became even more important. Consequently, the optimization of internal processes with external links to suppliers was
simultaneously rooted in the concepts of lean production and just-in-time (JIT).
Throughout the 1990s, companies concentrated on development approaches to
core competencies, outsourcing, innovations, and collaboration. These trends were
caused by globalization, advancements in IT, and integration processes in the world
economy. Particularly in the 1990s, a paradigm of supply chain management (SCM)
was established that has shaped developments in SCOM into the twenty-ﬁrst
century.
From 2010 to 2018, trends such as digitalization, smart operations, predictive
analytics, risk management, SC resilience and ﬂexibility, intelligent information
technologies, e-operations, leanness and agility, the servitization of manufacturing,
outsourcing and globalization, additive manufacturing, and Industry 4.0 shaped the
SCOM landscape in practice and research.

1.2.2

Supply Chain Management

A supply chain (SC) is a network of organizations and processes wherein a number
of various enterprises (suppliers, manufacturers, distributors and retailers) collaborate (cooperate and coordinate) along the entire value chain to acquire raw materials,
to convert these raw materials into speciﬁed ﬁnal products, and to deliver these ﬁnal
products to customers (see Fig. 1.4).
Supply chain management (SCM) is a cross-department and cross-enterprise
integration and coordination of material, information, and ﬁnancial ﬂows to transform and use the SC resources in the most rational way along the entire value chain,
from raw material suppliers to customers. SCM is one of the key components of any
organization and is responsible for balancing demand and supply along the entire
value-adding chain (see Fig. 1.5).
SCM integrates production and logistics processes. In practice, production,
logistics, and SCM problems interact with each other and are tightly interlinked.
Only two decades have passed since enterprise management and organizational

8

Basics of Supply Chain and Operations Management

Fig. 1.4 Supply chain

Fig. 1.5 Functions of logistics, production, and SCM in a value chain [from Ivanov and Sokolov
(2010)]

structure have been considered from the functional perspective: marketing, research
and development, procurement, warehousing, manufacturing, sales, and ﬁnance.
The development of SCM was driven in the 1990s by three main trends: customer
orientation, globalization of markets, and the establishment of an information society. These trends caused changes in the competitive strategies of enterprises and
required new value chain management concepts.
The ﬁrst use of the term “SCM” occurred in the article “SCM: Logistics Catches
up with Strategy” by Oliver and Webber (1982). They set out to examine material

1.2 Basic Definitions and Decisions

ﬂows from the raw material suppliers through the SC to the end consumers within an
integrated framework that is now called SCM. The origins of SCM can be seen in
early works on postponement, system dynamics and the bullwhip effect (Forrester
1961), cooperation (Bowersox 1969), multi-echelon inventory management
(Geoffrion and Graves 1974), JIT, and lean production.
SCM, as the term implies, is primarily focused on the inter-organizational level.
Another successful application of SCM depends on intra-organizational changes to a
very large extent. Even collaborative processes with an extended information system
applications are managed by people who work in different departments: marketing,
procurement, sales, production, etc. The interests of these departments are usually in
conﬂict with each other. Hence, not only outbound synchronizations, but also
internal organizational synchronizations are encompassed by SC organization.

1.2.3

Decisions in Supply Chain and Operations Management

The main management task is making decisions. Decisions in SC and operations
management (SCOM) are primarily directed towards matching demand and supply
by designing and operating the transformation process in the most efﬁcient way. Put
simply: SCOM is building a bridge between customers and suppliers (Fig. 1.6).
Consider an example. A Chocolate SC can be used as an illustration for depicting
basic decisions in SCOM. What happens between the cocoa pod harvest and the
placement of the chocolate on supermarket shelves? A complex SC is built to
connect raw material suppliers and end customers (see Fig. 1.7).
To produce chocolate, cocoa pods are ﬁrst harvested from cocoa trees, e.g. in
Côte D’ivoire. Cocoa pods are then moved by donkeys to a processing station where
they are packed into special carrier bags to avoid damage during transportation by
container ship. At the harbor, the bags are packed into special containers and moved
to a container ship that will bring them, e.g., to Hamburg.
Along with sugar and milk powder, vanilla is also one of the components needed
for chocolate production. Sugar and milk powder are usually sourced locally to
avoid long transportation. After unloading at the Hamburg harbor, through which up
to 200,000 tons of cocoa pods are shipped each year, the transportation is continued
by trucks. Simultaneously, container ships in Guatemala and Madagascar leave the
harbor with cargoes full of vanilla.
The cocoa pods are delivered to a preliminary processing plant and separated into
cocoa butter and cocoa mass which are then moved in trucks by road to chocolate
manufacturers. After getting all the ingredients, a multi-stage manufacturing process
is started, the ﬁnal result of which is chocolate. Chocolate is then packed and
delivered in large batches on pallets to distribution centers. From here, small batches
are ﬁnally delivered to supermarket.
It can be observed from the chocolate SC and Santa Claus’s SC that the
responsibilities of SCOM managers can be divided into sourcing, production,
distribution, transportation, and SCM subject to business administration, information system, optimization and simulation, and engineering (see Fig. 1.8).

Fig. 1.9 Decision matrix in supply chain and operations management

The responsibilities of SCOM managers are multi-faceted (see Fig. 1.9). The
decision-making areas in SCOM range from strategic to tactical and operative levels
(Ivanov 2010). Strategic issues include, for example, determination of the size and
location of manufacturing plants or distribution centers, decisions on the structure of
service networks, factory planning, and design of the SC. Tactical issues include
such decisions about production, transportation, and inventory planning. Operative
issues involve production scheduling and control, inventory control, quality control
and inspection, vehicle routing, trafﬁc and materials handling, and equipment
maintenance policies.
This description holds true for many different organizations including global
brand manufacturers such as Apple or Toyota, major retailers such as Tesco or
Wal-Mart, nonproﬁt organizations such as International Red Cross, or local petrol
stations or hospitals. Purchasing, assembly, shipping, stocking, and even communicating are a few examples of the many different actions unfolding within these
organizations, all united by a single purpose: to create value for a customer.

1.3

Careers and Future Challenges in Supply Chain
and Operations Management

SCOM is everywhere! SCOM specialists should obtain different qualiﬁcations since
SCOM is multi-disciplinary in its nature. There are many skills and attributes which
are important for SC and operations managers to succeed in the operations environment. These are:
• systems and engineering knowledge
• leadership and strong communication skills

12

1

Basics of Supply Chain and Operations Management

• general multidisciplinary business knowledge
• strong analytical problem solving abilities and quantitative skills
• negotiation and presentation skills.
To become an SC or operations manager, it is important to be able to communicate well with people from all departments. There is a strong relationship
between the SCOM function and other core and support functions of the organization, such as accounting and ﬁnance, product development, human resources,
information systems, and marketing functions. Another important skill is time
management.
Some of the job responsibilities common to SCOM are as follows:
• coordinating business processes concerned with the production, pricing, sales,
and distribution of products and services
• managing workforce, preparing schedules and assigning speciﬁc duties
• reviewing performance data to measure productivity and other performance
indicators
• coordinating activities directly related to making products/providing services
• planning goods and services to be sold based on forecasts of customer demand
• managing the movement of goods into and out of production facilities
• locating, selecting, and procuring merchandise for resale, representing management in purchase negotiations
• managing inventory and collaborating with suppliers
• planning warehouse and store layouts and designing production processes

SC and operations managers have strategic responsibility, but also control many
of the everyday functions of a business or organization. They oversee and manage
goods used at the facility such as sales merchandise, inventory, or production
materials. SC and operations managers also authorize and approve vendors and
contract services at different locations worldwide. Starting positions for SCOM
typically include operative responsibilities in procurement or sales departments
and work as, for example, a consultant, customer service manager, or a SC analyst.
With 5–10 years of practical experience, such positions as purchasing manager,
transportation manager, international logistics manager, warehouse operations manager, or SC software manager can be achieved. With 10 or more years of experience,
vice president of SCOM is a realistic position.
SCOM positions may include jobs in production planning, inventory control,
materials control, work scheduling, quality control, and operations analysis. There

management and analytical skills you need to launch your international
career in global SCM, operations, and logistics. Three pillars build the
textbook framework: practical orientation and creation of working
knowledge, methodical focus, and personal development of students
the development of advanced communication, interaction, and organizational skills with the help of case studies and business simulation
games.

A career in SCOM opens the door to many opportunities. The job itself is diverse,
because of the variety of tasks completed by SC and operations managers. Another
advantage is the high income expected, especially for experienced SC and operations
managers. On the other hand, there may be long working hours and stress.
Operations and SC managers generally have to work in a changing environment,
so they have to be ﬂexible. As can be observed in the real job offers, ﬂexible
managers with a willingness to travel a lot are always in demand.

Key Points

Operations is a function or system that transforms inputs into outputs of greater
value. Operations management is involved with managing resources in order to
produce and deliver products and services. It includes the stages of sourcing,
production, distribution, and after sales. A supply chain is the network of
organizations and processes along the entire value chain. SCM is a collaborative
philosophy and a set of methods and tools for integrating and coordinating local
logistics processes and their links with production processes from the perspective of
the entire value chain and its total performance.
SCOM is everywhere: in production, logistics, healthcare, airlines, entertainment
parks, passenger transport, hotels, building and construction, etc. Key objectives of

16

Basics of Supply Chain and Operations Management

SCOM are costs, time, quality, and resilience. A career is SCOM is multi-faceted
and requires multidisciplinary knowledge that are comprised of elements from
business administration, optimization, engineering, and information systems.
Examples include logistics problems, warehouse management, transportation optimization, procurement quantity optimization, inventory management, cross-docking
design, intermodal terminals design, etc. Accordingly, production management
deals with optimizations in assembly lines, production cells, etc. SCM problems
include supply chain design, demand planning, and supply coordination.

Nike: Sourcing Strategy in the Integrated Supply Chain

Since its establishment, Nike has evolved into a global enterprise providing trainers
and sports garments to customers worldwide. Now the company has several brands,
operates in 170 countries, employs 38,000 staff, and possesses 100 sales and
65 administrative ofﬁces across the world. Nike owns 700 retail stores and works
with 900 contracted factories, which manufacture a wide variety of products for
Nike. Nike’s revenue in 2012 was $24.1 billion, cost of sales was $13.6 billion, and
inventory was $3.4 billion.
A sourcing strategy is essential for Nike since the company’s production and
logistics strategy is based on outsourcing (see Fig. 2.1).

Fig. 2.1 Nike’s supply chain

Nike executes a long-term sourcing consolidation strategy and is streamlining its
SC operations. In 2007 Nike began assessing its contract manufacturing base and
undertaking a multi-year strategy in order to:
• streamline the SC to focus on a number of contract manufacturing groups;
• build a strong and sustainable sourcing base for greater operational efﬁciencies
and future growth;
• identify sub-contractors able to deliver best performance of products and
innovation;
• align sub-contractors in terms of Nike’s corporate responsibility principles.
Nike has been shifting from a risk-reduction focus—which devotes time and
attention to the lowest factory performers—to a strategy that invests time and
attention in strengthening relationships with the factories operating at the highest
performance levels.
A new manufacturing index (MI) was implemented in 2012. It integrates scores
from key performance areas into a single scoreboard rating that groups factories as
Gold, Silver, Bronze, Yellow, or Red. Contract factories that are able to consistently
exceed Nike’s requirements in the areas, equally weighted, of quality, costs, delivery, and sustainability performance management, and that show consistent performance leadership in the industry will achieve a Silver rating in the MI. Contract
factories that go beyond industry and demonstrate innovation and benchmark
performance within the broader manufacturing landscape will achieve Gold. At a
minimum, factories in Nike’s SC will be expected to achieve and sustain a Bronze
rating, indicating that the factory meets baseline standards and can self-govern
through integrated systems and a lean approach.

2.1 Examples of Operations and Supply Chains in Manufacturing

19

The MI creates one overall score for each contract factory, enabling a consistent
and comprehensive conversation about Nike’s business with that factory. Nike
develops incentives and sanctions based on the MI ratings. For example, Silverand Gold-rated factories will be able to self-audit and calibrate with Nike staff and
will have access to a range of Nike’s technical assistance, leadership, and education
resources, as well as possible innovation or community co-investment and priority
consideration for orders.
Nike initiated several schemes to make its SC more sustainable and environmentally friendly. Nike has set up Sustainable Manufacturing & Sourcing-Sustainable—
a new organizational structure within the company that has brought together labor
compliance, health, safety, and environment, lean manufacturing, human resources
management, climate and energy, and waste and water management.
In 2005, Nike disclosed its factory list. A SC map of Nike can be seen online at
http://nikeinc.com/pages/manufacturing.
Discussion (see Chap. 5)
• What advantages and disadvantages do you see in the outsourcing strategy?
• Select and calculate at least two performance indicators to evaluate the inventory
management performance at Nike!
• What do you think of the MI at Nike from the position of a contract manufacture?

Dangote Cement: Establishing Sophisticated Supply Chain
Management in Africa

The African economy has undergone fundamental changes over the last decade.
However, in most African countries, particularly the lower income countries, infrastructure emerges as a major constraint on business. The distribution network of
Africa is comprised of waterways, airways, railways, roads, and pipelines.
With its operational headquarters in Lagos, Nigeria in West Africa, the Dangote
Group is one of the most diversiﬁed business conglomerates in Africa with a
reputation for excellent business practices and product quality. The group’s activities
encompass cement, sugar, food, and poly products manufacturing, sugar and salt
reﬁning, ﬂour milling, and logistics port management.
The SC of Dangote Cement has the following structure (see Fig. 2.2):
Dangote Cement is a fully integrated cement company and has projects and
operations in Nigeria and 14 other African countries. Dangote Cement’s production
capacity in Nigeria is comprised of three existing cement plants in Obajana, Ibese,
and Gboko. Their combined production capacity is about 20 million tonnes per year.
The Obajana Cement Plant (OCP) located in Kogi State is reputed to be one of the
largest cement plants in the world.
The Dangote Group has experienced growth in the quality of its goods and
services, focusing on cost leadership and the efﬁciency of its human capital. The
group’s core business focus is to provide local products and services that meet the

20

2

Examples from Different Industries, Services, and Continents

Fig. 2.2 Dangote cement’s supply chain

basic needs of the population. Through the construction and operation of large-scale
manufacturing facilities in Nigeria and across Africa, the group is focused on
building local manufacturing capacity to generate employment and provide highquality goods.
The raw materials required to produce cement (calcium carbonate, silica, alumina,
and iron ore) are generally extracted from lime stock rock, chalk, clayey schist, or
clay. Dangote Cement owns or has licenses for the quarries/deposits which are
located near their manufacturing plants. Dangote Cement currently has operations
in six African countries: Cote D’Ivoire, Guinea, Ghana, Liberia, Sierra Leone, and
Togo. Dangote Cement’s expanded African operations will include factories in
South Africa, Senegal, Cameroon, Gabon, Benin, Ethiopia, Tanzania, Zambia, and
the Republic of Congo. The company has deployed modern robotic laboratories in all
its cement plants. These modern laboratories are operated by trained personnel and
are provided with the latest technologies, practices, and standards.

2.1.2.1 Supply Chain Management
Dangote Cement has adopted a fully integrated SCM model. The SC is managed as a
single entity, thus ensuring information ﬂows throughout the entire system. Dangote
Cement runs an integrated make-to-order model which requires tracking of customer
demand in real time. This is the reason why Dangote adopted CPFR (collaborative
planning forecasting, and replenishment): to balance demand and supply with the
help of distributors and retailers. All members of the SC are involved and freely
share planning, demand, forecasting, and inventory information among themselves.
Collaboration is ensured in drawing up production, marketing and shipment plans.
All processes, from raw materials extraction, through the value-adding processes to
distribution channels, are interlinked within the organization.
2.1.2.2 Logistics Management
The biggest challenge for Dangote Cement, and for the industry, is to tackle logistics
and distribution costs, as cement has to be moved to markets from production
centers. Being one of the largest cement producers in Africa, the company uses the
cost-efﬁcient sea transportation to supply its Pan-African operations. Two dedicated

2.1 Examples of Operations and Supply Chains in Manufacturing

21

export water terminals located in Calabar and Lagosare are used for freighting
cement from Nigeria through international transportation to their markets.
Road transportation is the most widely used form of transportation utilized by
Dangote Cement. It is the only option for landlocked nations and the most viable in
the majority of other African nations because of the poor rail infrastructure (the
company is in active consultation with various governments for a possible revival of
the railways to enable cheaper distribution costs).
Dangote Cement enjoys the beneﬁt of an in-house transport ﬂeet to ensure SC
efﬁciency. The company owns a ﬂeet of trucks and has a subsidiary called
“Dantrans,” which provides freight services with a ﬂeet of over 3000 trucks under
commercially competitive terms to members of the group to facilitate transport of
raw materials from the sea ports to factories located inland, and for the distribution of
ﬁnished goods. The ﬂeet of trucks and haulage is monitored by trace and tracking
(T&T) systems. Dangote Cement has its own depots and warehouses in several
locations to serve various dealers, as well as corporate and institutional buyers.
The ﬂeet is deployed strategically across Nigeria to ensure the company’s cement
has access to every corner of the country. To mitigate any disruption, regional
transport hubs are backed by fully ﬂedged workshops to take preventive action
and deliver maintenance. The company implements scientiﬁc logistic solutions to
ﬁnd means of effective distribution.

2.1.2.3 Distribution Management
Cement transportation and storage is capital intensive because of the high volume to
weight ratio of the product. Dangote Cement adopts a robust and pragmatic approach
to ensure a smooth material ﬂow throughout the distribution network. This is
essential for meeting customer demands at all times while minimizing SC costs.
Dangote Cement ﬁrst began its operations in Nigeria as an importer and built six
terminals in Lagos and Port Harcourt. Soon after, Nigeria’s cement sector became
self-sufﬁcient, and, as a result, two terminals that were built to import cement are
now being used for export. In addition, new terminals in other neighboring countries
have been built to expand the SC and distribute cement by road through the supply
network and to the customer.
Dangote Cement has now invested in various strategic locations for depots across
Nigeria to ensure quick supply. Dangote Cement owns and operates 67 warehouses
and cement depots spread across various strategic locations in Nigeria to service the
local market. They serve an ever growing list of authorized distributors who sell
bagged cement to retailers and bulk users.
The company maintains close relations with all dealers, offering attractive returns
on cement sales as well as supporting dealers with prompt supplies through its
dedicated haulage or through third-party transportation. Dangote Cement has
recently launched a special drive to enroll new dealers and distributors with
simpliﬁed online, direct enrollment processes to further strengthen its distribution
network. A vendor-managed inventory (VMI) system is used to maintain adequate
cement inventory at all times on behalf of Dangote Cement under the terms of a
contractual agreement with the authorized distributors. Retailers in turn purchase

22

2

Examples from Different Industries, Services, and Continents

cement in bulk from the authorized distributors and sell in retail quantities to
low-level end users.
Dangote Cement recently extended its ability to deliver cement directly to
customers by investing in additional trucks and a call center to deal with customer
orders. Such a distribution model helps the company increase its market share by
providing more options for customers and with value-added services.

2.1.2.4 Sustainability Management
Cement manufacturing causes environmental impacts at all stages. These include
emissions of airborne pollution in the form of dust, gases, noise, and vibration from
operating machinery and blasting in quarries, and damage to the countryside from
quarrying. Equipment to reduce dust emissions during quarrying and the
manufacturing of cement are widely used. More equipment for trapping and
separating exhaust gases are coming into increased use. Environmental protection
also includes the re-integration of quarries into the countryside after they have been
closed down by returning them to nature or re-cultivating them. Some of the
company’s sustainability measures include: usage of ﬁlters for minimal dust emission; usage of fossil fuel in order to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases; usage of
natural gas for power generation; dust-free manufacturing by covering raw material
and process conveyers; usage of covered conveyer belts from lime stone mines to
plant in order to minimize vehicle movement; usage of environmentally friendly
polypropylene bags for packing; utilization of rain water to keep plant cool; and a
water treatment plant for water reuse.
Discussion
• What problems might Dangote Cement experience in the future concerning its
SC?
• Why might its self owned transportation ﬂeet be an advantage for Dangote
Cement? Can you see any risks in having a self owned transportation ﬂeet?
• Describe Dangote Cement’s production, logistics, and distribution networks!
• How does Dangote Cement’s main product inﬂuence its production, logistics, and
distribution strategies?
• What do you think about the introduction of direct shipments to customers?

2.1.3

Toyota: Supply Chain Disruption Management

A special focus of SCOM at Toyota is risk and disruption management. Many parts
of the Toyota’s SC are located in areas that are likely to be hit by an earthquake. As
such, the risk that Toyota’s SC might suffer from those disasters is rising, and the
damage could severely impact production and other activities. Given this context, it
is essential to assume that Toyota, with its restricted resources, would suffer greatly
from such a disaster and so should make preparations to affect early recovery. For
these reasons, Toyota is reassessing its business continuity plan. The foremost

2.1 Examples of Operations and Supply Chains in Manufacturing

23

premise of Toyota’s business continuity plan is to work on preparedness before and
recovery after disaster happens.
As a part of the preparedness, Toyota addressed the difﬁculty of “energy,
information and transport network fragmentation” once disasters occur, and developed a hybrid car for the Miyagi Prefectural Police, installed with external power
provision systems. In addition to providing good fuel efﬁciency and environmental
performance in normal operations, during disasters these cars can be driven on fuel
or electricity, and even have a power supply function that allows electricity to be
drawn from the car.
Toyota’s help in disaster recovery is illustrated by its sending workers to its
disaster affected production sites where they can be engaged in numerous activities,
such as restoring facilities and distributing disaster relief supplies. Worker
volunteers from the Toyota Corporation continue to help with restoration efforts
for individuals in areas hit hardest by the latest disaster. Toyota additionally provides
material support: trucks with relief supplies from the Toyota Corporation which are
gathered at two local production sites.
Learning from previous experiences, Toyota has prepared a nationwide framework that utilizes the warehouses and logistics network throughout Japan for
sending relief supplies to disaster affected areas. In addition to stocking emergency
supplies at the 34 distributors nationwide, Toyota has also built a framework for
sending relief supplies to the disaster affected distributors. Taking into consideration
possible problems such as motor fuel shortages, this framework is important for
delivering quick and reliable support to disaster affected sites.
The risk management committee at Toyota organizes meetings twice a year to
identify risks that may affect business activities and to take preventative actions
against the negative impacts of those risks. The committee members include the
global chief risk ofﬁcer (CRC), regional CRSs, and all senior managers and chief
ofﬁcers. They work to manage and prevent the major risks in the regions and report
on any immediate and serious disruptions.

2.1.4

Tesla Gigafactory

The Tesla Gigafactory is a major development project of the U.S. electric car
manufacturer Tesla, which cooperates with strategic partners such as Panasonic.
The Gigafactory will serve Tesla’s strategic long term goal of producing sufﬁcient
numbers of lithium-ion batteries, which are required to produce larger ﬂeets of
electric vehicles in the future and to overhaul the automotive industry with sustainable energy generation. By 2018, the Gigafactory will reach full capacity, producing
more batteries in one year than were produced in 2013 globally (Tesla 2017).
The Gigafactory will be located in Nevada, and construction work began in June
2014 (Tesla 2017). In the beginning of 2017, Tesla’s Gigafactory started producing
the ﬁrst batteries, even though only 30% of the entire project was ﬁnalized at that
point. The Gigafactory will cover an area of 530,000 m2, which makes it the biggest
manufacturing building worldwide. Working at full capacity, the Gigafactory will be

24

2

Examples from Different Industries, Services, and Continents

able to annually produce battery capacity of 35 gigawatt-hours (GWh), which is
sufﬁcient to power 1.5 million Tesla Model 3s. Besides producing lithium-ion
batteries, Tesla also plans to produce electric engines and transmission components
at the Gigafactory. The roof of the Gigafactory will be covered by a 70 MW solar
plant with the goal of achieving net zero energy. As many as 10,000 people will
work at the Gigafactory, while another 20,000–30,000 new jobs will be created in
the related ﬁelds of suppliers and service providers (Auto Motor Sport 2017;
Manager magazin 2017).
On the whole, the costs for the Gigafactory project amount to 5 billion U.S
Dollars. But Tesla expects proﬁtable improvements from that investment. The
Gigafactory will be able to produce batteries for signiﬁcantly lower costs using
economies of scale, innovative manufacturing, reduction of waste, and the simple
optimization of locating most manufacturing processes under one roof. Because of
these beneﬁts, Tesla expects to drive down the per kilowatt hour (kWh) cost of a
battery pack by more than 30% (Auto Motor Sport 2017; Tesla 2017). Tesla boss
Elon Musk refers to the current development project as Gigafactory 1, indicating that
there will be additional Gigafactory projects following in the future, the next
potentially in Europe (Manager magazin 2017).
Discussion
• Why is Tesla starting this large-scale project?
• What needs to be thought of when choosing an appropriate location for such a
project?
• What needs to be considered in terms of Facility Planning?
• What challenges and potential problems for such a Gigafactory exist?

SCOM in Restaurants: Case Study Starbucks Corporation

The Starbucks Corporation, founded in 1971, is one of the world’s largest coffee
house chains, with more than 17,240 coffee shops in over 50 countries. Starbucks’
product portfolio consists of food items, as well as coffee specialties, tea, and other
refreshing drinks. Starbucks Corporation also offers roasted beans and several
merchandise products. However, Starbucks’ main product is coffee. Therefore,
and because of Starbucks’ large and complex global supply SC, this case focuses
only on the coffee bean. In particular the company’s production and sourcing
strategy and its transportation network are considered.
Like most restaurants, Starbucks uses the production strategy “Make-to-Stock,”
which means production is performed in expectation of a customer order. Reasons
for choosing this strategy include scale effects which result in lower transportation

2.2 Examples of Operations and Supply Chains in Services

25

Fig. 2.3 Starbucks’s SC

and manufacturing costs and higher ﬂexibility compared to other production
strategies. To decrease the lead time of coffee deliveries and to further decrease
transportation costs, Starbucks aims to manufacture in the region where the coffee is
sold. To regionalize coffee manufacturing, Starbucks owns ﬁve coffee roasting
plants, four of them located in the United States and the ﬁfth in the Netherlands.
In addition to its company-owned coffee roasting plants, Starbucks works with
24 contract manufacturers in the United States, Canada, Europe, Asia, and Latin
America.
Starbucks has spread its production across a wide territory. Nevertheless transportation, logistics, and distribution are still the biggest parts of Starbucks’ operating
expenses. The existence of an efﬁcient and effective single, global logistics system is
essential for the company. Figure 2.3 shows the SC of the Starbucks Corporation.
The company has a multiple sourcing concept. The suppliers of the coffee beans
are mainly located in Latin America, Asia, and Africa. To ensure ethical sourcing of
the high quality coffee beans, Starbucks uses Coffee and Farmer Equity (CAFE)
practices. CAFE is a set of guidelines which evaluates the social, economic, and
environmental aspects of coffee production. This allows Starbucks to address
sustainability issues which have become very important in SCM.
Starbucks uses ships and trucks for transportation. The Starbucks Corporation
normally delivers the unroasted beans in ocean containers to the United States and
Europe. From the port of entry, the goods are trucked to a storage site close to one of
the coffee roasting plants. Once the beans are roasted and packaged, the coffee is
delivered to regional distribution centers by trucks. In total, Starbucks runs nine
regional distribution centers, ﬁve in the United States, two in Europe, and two in
Asia. Each of the distribution centers covers 200,000 to 300,000 square feet. Other
goods needed for running a coffee shop are also stored there. From the distribution
centers, the products are delivered either directly to the store or to central distribution
centers, which are smaller warehouses. In total, the Starbucks Corporation has
48 central warehouses worldwide. From there the coffee beans and other products
are frequently trucked to retail stores and retail outlets.

Operations Management at Airport Madrid/Barajas

Airport Madrid/Barajas is among the largest in Europe in terms of the volume of
passengers and aircraft operations. As all airports do, Madrid/Barajas divides its
process range in two different areas:
• Airside, where activities related to aircraft operations happen, such as approach,
taxiing, and turnaround (fueling, push-back, etc.);
• Landside, the area next to terminal activities (parking, bus stations, etc.) The
terminal is the most important component of the landside.
The airport’s operational center must coordinate not only airlines and air trafﬁc
control (ATC), but all other sub-actors involved in the process such as passengers,
government and security, handling companies, luggage, technicians, etc. In the case
of Madrid/Barajas, all of those actors, sub-actors, and stakeholders are controlled
and coordinated through the airport management center (AMC) with the real-time
philosophy of modern airports.
The effectiveness of an airport is directly related to the number of start and
landing operations performed per time period. But what happens if the arriving
aircrafts do not get a taxiway clearance from the control tower, or there is no
available gate to park at, or there are no available handling agents to load or unload
the baggage? The AMC must therefore coordinate every single operation that occurs
at the Madrid/Barajas airport, planning every movement and quickly solving any
unexpected problems or conﬂicts.
A particular challenge of operations management at airports is that operations
processes are highly inﬂuenced by uncertain external factors. The most relevant is
the weather. Before the AMC was created, operations management was established
to act according to certain standards, but when conditions varied (weather, aircraft
delays, inoperative apron, stands, gates etc.), the system wasn’t able to respond
effectively.
As a consequence, airport managers agreed to change the way all actors were
coordinated, commanded, and controlled. This led to the AMC adopting a real-time
philosophy. The AMC is the centralized unit of an airport’s operations created to
manage all of its daily activities. Implementation became a big challenge and the
most important step ever, in terms of operations management, was carried out in

2.2 Examples of Operations and Supply Chains in Services

27

Madrid/Barajas. The objectives of the AMC are as follows: to offer a general view of
an airport’s functioning at any time; to provide a unique point of contact for
operators, agents, and the airport’s divisions; to support the integrated management
of the systems; and to supervise the levels of service to optimize resources and
reduce the costs of operations.
The implementation of the AMC considered new subdivisions in terms of
operations management, and made them all work together in a well-coordinated
manner in the same physical space. The AMC became the unit where four different
subdivisions of the airport’s operations management (Aircraft Operations, Security,
Passenger Services, and Infrastructure) interact quickly and effectively in any
expected or unexpected situation with the help of information technologies like
video-walls, infrared cameras, PDAs, and communication devices.
The following case describes brieﬂy how the AMC operates in the event of a
snow forecast, which usually happens in Madrid/Barajas at least twice every winter,
and for which any airport should be prepared.
The plan of action is divided into six different phases:
Phase 1: Pre-activation
When an airport’s METEO forecasts a 40% or more probability of snow, it contacts
the AMC, and delivers an urgent message. The operations manager takes the lead
and starts to coordinate all the means needed to prepare the airport for the upcoming
situation. The manager on duty decides with the coordinator which plan to activate,
and the way to proceed. This phase consists of localizing and informing stakeholders,
technicians, and drivers to warn them about the situation and the activation of
the plan.
Phase 2: Positioning
In this phase the manager on duty will give instructions to the coordinator of the
AMC to allocate all the means requested in the ﬁrst phase in their set-points at least
2 h before the snow is forecast.
Phase 3: Pre-acting
This phase will be activated 1 h prior to the snow forecast. In coordination with the
air trafﬁc manager, the operations manager instructs the AMC coordinator to inform
all relevant parties and coordinate the so-called pre-acting phase. The technicians
will start preparing the runways and spreading speciﬁc products over runways and
the taxiways. These products will make the snow melt. This will be carried out
within 30 min, half an hour before it starts to snow.
Phase 4: Evaluation
In coordination with ATC (tower), the AMC starts coordinating the collection of
information about the state of the airﬁeld through the technicians, pilots, and airﬁeld
operators. If the coefﬁcient of friction on the runway is low, the service executive
will give instructions to activate the ﬁfth phase.

28

Examples from Different Industries, Services, and Continents

Phase 5: Clearing Runways and Taxiways
If the manager on duty decides to act concerning the low coefﬁcient of friction, he
will be in constant contact with ATC. The procedure will be as usual.
Phase 6: Cancelling
The manager on duty, together with the AMC coordinators, will evaluate the
circumstances and proceed to cancellation. The information will be disseminated
to the rest of the agents involved.
Future development of the AMC is directed towards a collaborative decision
making system, which is an operations system that allows stakeholders to enter and
receive real-time information that each one of them needs to operate more efﬁciently.
The actors involved are ATC, aircraft operators, handling companies, airport
operations, and control ﬂow management unit (CFMU). ATC gets information
from the CFMU. Once ATC knows when exactly the aircraft will be landing, they
will communicate to handling companies and airport operations to be able to more
efﬁciently manage the services provided to the aircraft.

Time-Critical Supply Chains: Disaster Management
and Humanitarian Logistics

Commonly, logistics is associated with the business ﬁeld. However, in recent years
particular efforts have been directed at investigating severe SC disruptions, which
can be caused, for example, by natural disasters, political conﬂicts, terrorism,
maritime piracy, economic crises, destruction of information systems, or transport
infrastructure failures. In this setting, humanitarian logistics has become more and
more important. We can categorize natural disasters and man-made disasters, such as
wars and terrorist attacks.
Disaster/humanitarian logistics is a relatively new ﬁeld which has only recently
received more attention. This is due to increasing political conﬂicts along with the
accelerating strength of natural disasters. The main challenge of humanitarian logistics is the coordination of activities in a destroyed environment. This can become
extremely complex since almost all parameters are unknown up to the point of the
disaster start and even after the event. Not knowing the type or amount of goods
needed or the actual shipment location makes humanitarian logistics a particularly
challenging ﬁeld.
Each year more than 500 catastrophes of different kinds occur worldwide. The
UN Humanitarian Response Depots (UNHRD), which is a UN organization under

2.2 Examples of Operations and Supply Chains in Services

29

Fig. 2.4 Global supply emergency network for humanitarian logistics (source: World Food
Program)

the head of the World Food Program, reacts quickly when disasters occur. Usually,
the most necessary supplies are food and water. The organization has developed a
concept whereby emergency supplies are stored in ﬁve hubs worldwide: in Ghana,
UAE, Malaysia, Panama, and Italy (see Fig. 2.4). The hubs also contain medical kits,
shelter items, and IT equipment. Through this network, the UNHRD is able to start
supplying goods to every country in the world within 1–2 days.
The effectiveness of the emergency aid response relies on logistics speed and
efﬁciency: logistics is key to humanitarian relief operations. Time is the most
important factor as it inﬂuences how many lives can be saved. It is necessary to be
prepared at all times. The disaster management cycle has four stages (Altay and
Green 2006):
• Mitigation is a role played by the government, where the host government is
responsible for putting protocols in place and taking action to reduce the probability of disasters.
• Preparedness refers to the various operations that occur before a disaster strikes.
Here the physical network is designed, and information and communication
technology (ICT) systems are developed together with bases of collaborators.
• Response is the various operations that are instantly implemented after a disaster
occurs. First, all collaborators get involved; second, in the shortest time possible
they try to restore basic services and delivery of goods to the highest possible
number of beneﬁciaries. Collaboration and coordination among the players are
crucial.
• Reconstruction is the operations in the aftermath of a disaster. It involves rehabilitation and has the aim of addressing problems from a long-term perspective,
since the after-effects of the disaster can continue for decades.

30

Examples from Different Industries, Services, and Continents

When a disaster does occur, the local government needs to request the World
Food Program’s help. First, food supplies are sent out immediately. Following this,
employees are sent to disaster areas to access information about demands for goods.
They also evaluate the best means of transporting the goods to the affected area.
Next, the emergency operation is planned and budgeted. To receive ﬁnancial aid, the
World Food Program requests funds from countries worldwide. Most funds are then
received out of government expenditure. A team of logistics experts develops
transport routes for all the required goods to the area where the disaster occurred
using all possible transportation means. Particular importance is assigned to
reorganizing the ICT as it will help further operations through improved information
ﬂow. The World Food Program has an IT team which is specially trained to set up
information infrastructure within 1 day.
In November 2013, one of the strongest typhoons recorded, “Haiyan,” hit the
Philippines. It killed thousands and destroyed such infrastructure as roads, ports, and
hospitals. Many logistic problems were encountered from the beginning:
• most of the roads, airport and harbours were destroyed;
• weather conditions after the typhoon were still bad (rain, strong winds, etc.);
• no electricity was available, due to lack of fuel for generators, which also led to
mobilization problems;
• acute shortages of food and water and lack of medical supplies or proper hospital
facilities were observed.
The World Food Program was working closely with local government to provide
as much help as possible. As soon as the typhoon hit, the organization supplied “high
energy biscuits” and rice. Moreover, logistics and telecommunication support were
also provided by the World Food Program. The goods ﬁnanced by international
donations were distributed via hubs in Cebu, Tacloban, Roxas, Ormoc, and Guiuan
in the Philippines.
However, not only non-proﬁt organizations take responsibility for humanitarian
aid. DHL, which is a German logistics company, also engaged in activities in the
Philippines in 2013. In cooperation with the UN, the company built up a global
network of disaster response teams (DRT). These teams consisted of volunteers
employed at DHL and they are particularly trained for disaster situations. They are
divided into three areas worldwide so as to be able to access all regions quickly. In
the case of typhoon “Haiyan,” the team supported the accessibility of the airport and
increased throughput times so that goods could reach the victims faster. The DRT’s
greatest strength is their knowledge about logistics and how to solve crisis situations.
Since building up in 2005, the teams have been successfully able to support victims
of disasters more than 20 times.
For the future, the UN seeks to improve prevention. Naturally, it is impossible to
reduce all risks to a minimum level, but improving prevention measures is still an
option. A 10-year plan called the Hyogo Framework for Action (HFA) is designed to
reduce risks of natural disasters.

Operations Issues in Car Sharing

The business model of car sharing appears to be relatively new. However, its origins
can be found in Zurich, Switzerland, in 1948. Similar to car sharing today, in a
“Sefage” (Selbstfahrergemeinschaft) people could use one car together without
having to buy one of their own. Recently, changing preferences in passenger
transport, particularly in bigger cities, have boosted the demand for car sharing.
According to estimations of Navigant Research, global car-sharing revenue will
grow to $6.2 billion in 2020, up from $1 billion in 2013 (Clark 2014). The
advantages of car sharing are numerous, but high ﬂexibility at a low cost as
compared to possessing a car is probably the main reason why people increasingly
choose car sharing. Business customers also beneﬁt since they can use car sharing as
an add-on for the company car ﬂeet. Additionally, travel costs for employees can be
reduced by using car sharing instead of taxis. But there is even more to car sharing. It
decreases the total amount of cars in the city, which means less trafﬁc volume and
more parking spaces. Pollution has also decreased, especially since more and more
car sharing providers offer hybrid or completely electric driven vehicles.
There are two types of car sharing: station-bound and free-ﬂoating. Station bound
is the older version where the car is received and returned at the rental station. Most
of the time, it is now possible to return the car to a different station if it belongs to the
rental company. Free-ﬂoating is non station-bound, meaning the car can be rented
and left anywhere within a particular area. Charges are accrued either per minute
and/or per kilometer. This option of car sharing is more appropriate for short
distances.
Car sharing providers face challenges in operations management concerning
demand, capacity, location, and cost planning. Usually, car sharing is an additional
business ﬁeld for rental service providers or car manufacturers. For example,
DriveNow is a subsidiary owned by BMW and SIXT. Car2Go was founded by
Daimler and Europcar. These companies already have expert knowledge in demand
forecasting and capacity planning, which makes it easier to evaluate the number of
cars needed at different locations. The challenge faced in this ﬁeld is to meet demand
at peak-times and in different areas of the city.
For particular occasions, such as a big football game, it may happen that many
vehicles are used to drive to one particular location. Accordingly, there may be a
misallocation of cars within an area. It is easy for car sharing providers to track these
actions via GPS. To solve the problem, employees can be hired to spread the vehicles
throughout the city. This option can be quite expensive, as employees need to be

32

2

Examples from Different Industries, Services, and Continents

transported to the cars themselves too. A cheaper option is to offer beneﬁts for
customers such as free miles, bonus points, or other discounts.
Cost planning can also constitute an issue for operations management. Most car
sharing companies attempt to attract customers by offering free parking everywhere.
Once a parking ticket is received the rental company pays the fee. Whereas charges
for parking without a ticket used to be rather cheap, authorities have reacted by
increasing the prices. Charging fees constitutes a variable cost that may be difﬁcult to
forecast.

REWE: Expanding the Logistics Network

With a turnover of more than 49.7 billion euros, more than 8000 supermarkets, a
ﬂeet of almost 2000 trucks which make 965,000 trips annually, covering a distance
of 162 million kilometers and both collecting goods from suppliers and delivering
them to stores. With 327,600 employees (2013), the REWE Group is one of the
leading travel and tourism companies in Europe.
In 2008, extensive logistics modernization began in the company. The objectives
included an increase in warehouse productivity by 15% per square meter, higher
demand forecast accuracy, inventory reduction, and higher product availability rates
as well as transportation cost reduction and sustainability.
At present, the company operates about 30 distribution centers (DC) in Germany.
In 2011, a new DC in Oranienburg near Berlin was built for 60 million euros with an
area of 52,500 m2. The criteria for location selection were to shorten transportation
routes and maximize efﬁciency across the network. About 325 employees in
Oranienburg ensure the replenishment of REWE supermarkets with more than
12,000 SKU (stock keeping units). One hundred trucks deliver products to
330 supermarkets from Sassnitz und Jüterbog daily.

Fab.com

In this case study a business-to-consumer (B2C) e-commerce application of
operations management is considered. As an example we look at Fab.com, one of
the fastest growing B2C start-ups, and see why and how the company decided to
transit from a ﬂash sale to an inventory-based model.
We can learn in this case study:
1. how to determine the optimal location for a warehouse;
2. how to understand the trade-off “service level vs. costs”;
3. how to determine a distribution strategy and what the trade-offs are between the
number of warehouses and logistics costs;
4. which costs should be included in the facility location analysis;
5. how to improve and measure inventory management performance;
6. which information technologies exist to support SCOM decisions;
7. how to develop strategic collaboration with suppliers.

2.3.1.1 General Description
Fab.com started as a design-oriented e-commerce website selling ﬁne design at
affordable prices. Fab.com launched in June 2011, and has grown to serve two
million registered users in less than 7 months; by December 2012, it had grown to
serve over 10 million members and became one of the fastest growing e-commerce
start-ups in the US, and even globally. The core of the business is a concept that was
realized by a small design team and improved daily through careful analysis of user
data. The vision is to create a one-stop online store for well-designed goods. But as
Fab grew exponentially, it faced serious on-time delivery and customer service
issues.
Fab started and operated with its novel concept and marketing strategy, achieving
customer-centric guidelines, and taking full advantage of the internet. A welldesigned website, a user-friendly portal platform, a powerful backstage data
processing system, and accurate and efﬁcient handling of daily customers resulted
in rapid growth of registered members and revenue.
Mobile Commerce (M-Commerce) is a major focus for Fab. Customers with
smartphones purchase products twice as often as those who visit the website, and
tablet visitors purchase four times as often as web visitors. One-third of Fab’s
visitors are from these mobile devices and the company expects this number to
rise to as much as 50% in a year.

34

2

Examples from Different Industries, Services, and Continents

Social networking is also important for Fab. CEO Jason Goldberg himself keeps a
blog to announce or showcase anything about Fab. He is also quite active in
interacting directly with customers’ comments or feedback. Moreover, of the
company’s two million members, more than half came from sharing with friends.
Fab was a partner in Facebook’s Open Graph expansion, so that when people
purchase on Fab, their purchases appear on their friends’ Facebook feeds.

2.3.1.2 Problems with Which Fab Struggled
Due to an initial strategy aimed to eliminate inventory risk, Fab decided not to buy
any products until customers purchased an item online. To meet members’ curious
minds, Fab’s ten buyers scour the world for products that ﬁt Fab’s unique aesthetic.
This created a situation where Fab could promise only a long delivery time of
16 days. The customer service team was becoming overloaded with complaints.
Customers wanted high-quality products delivered fast, since getting unique
products delivered to them fast is far more important to them than only getting
unique products.
Fab itself has found from their data history that a unique product delivered swiftly
increases Fab’s customer satisfaction, the likelihood of repeat purchases, and the
propensity to promote Fab to one’s friends fourfold over a similar product that takes
longer to ship. Customers also requested better product descriptions and better
product imagery.
Furthermore, Fab had been relying on so-called ﬂash sales, where a limited
amount of merchandise is sold in a short period of time. This requires shoppers to
buy goods within a certain length of time. Such a concept was hard to operate on a
large scale: running a ﬂash-sales website is more time-consuming and requires extra
hours of work to ensure efﬁciency and good customer service simultaneously. As the
business grew, Fab realized they had the following issues:
1.
2.
3.
4.

Long delivery times caused low customer service satisfaction.
There was a shortage of favorable goods.
Labor costs were high.
As a small scale company, it had its limits and limitations.

2.3.1.3 Solutions
Earlier in 2013, the company shifted from a ﬂash-sale site to an “online lifestyle
shop” operated by a new inventory-based system with the following features.
Inventory-Based Management
Fab started to lease a warehouse, built its own SC, and purchased inventory. Now,
products come into Fab’s New Jersey warehouse and remain there until the sale
ends, usually between three and 30 days. If a customer orders an item which is in
stock, (around 75% of what Fab sells) it ships within 2 hours. That’s a huge change
from the 16 days it typically took Fab to ship before. By 2013, Fab had expanded its
footprint of warehouses to more than 500,000 ft2 across three locations, two in New
Jersey and one in Eindhoven, the Netherlands.

2.3 Examples of e-Operations and Supply Chains

35

Established Supplier Base
Fab relies on and supports original designers and makers, working with more than
20,000 product designers. Fab has its own supplier evaluation criteria list in accordance with its business concept. Fab collaborates with the designers directly by
providing a platform where they can showcase and sell their goods. Alternatively,
the collaboration is based on licensing new designs and manufacturing products on
the designers’ behalf or as authorized derivations and reproductions of their work.
Thus, on one hand, it helps designers globally scale up their businesses. On the other
hand, it secures Fab’s supplier base.
Advance Information Technology
As Fab started focusing on an inventory-based business model, they designed
processes and invested signiﬁcantly in technology and engineering staff to help
the company scale efﬁciently and reduce operating costs. Managing a global business forces a company to strengthen its SC. Fab elaborated on sourcing and planning
as it consolidated merchandising, marketing, and operations into a single unit in
New York. Fab transited its business model from ﬂash sales to a more scalable,
inventory planning model in order to secure a greater consumer base and proﬁtability. With a business model that can be managed with innovative technology and
fewer people, Fab is developing its in-house engineering talent and investing in
technical systems that will power their growth and scalability.
Fab also design systems to help the website to effectively and efﬁciently respond
to customer issues, whether it is offering easy returns and quickly getting a replacement product shipped, or automatically crediting customers when prices drop. Fab
now counts more than 110 employees in the product development and engineering
organization.
Fab’s key technology investments include:
• an inventory management system that provides visibility and control across all
facilities;
• a promotions framework that bubbles up the most compelling offers;
• innovative tools to help customers discover and ﬁnd what’s new;
• a personalization engine that provides personalized product recommendations
and thus a more relevant shopping experience;
• a new and improved mobile shopping experience that enhances its leadership
position in M-commerce.
Improvement in Logistics
As logistics is thought to be a base requirement for any retailer, Amazon is heading
towards same-day service. On 2013s “Cyber Monday,” they even used drones to
ensure 30 min deliveries. eBay has a 1 h pickup from local retailers. Fab also focuses
on building processes that optimize their transportation costs, as well as designing
innovative inventory controls to efﬁciently move products between facilities. Fab

36

2

Examples from Different Industries, Services, and Continents

has chosen warehouse locations that minimize shipping costs and reduce shipping
times and have outﬁtted those facilities with their own technical systems. The result
is that delivery times have dropped from 16 days to 3 days on average.
The logistics system development comprises the following features:
1. Previously, Fab outsourced their logistics in order to fundamentally improve
on-time delivery. Now Fab aims to stop using third-party logistics ﬁrms to handle
delivery planning. Instead, the company will bring all logistics operations
in-house and use an uninterruptable power supply (UPS) to transport products
to customers.
2. Fab promises free shipping with a minimum order value (in the US, this is $49).
But they also have adopted an alternative shipping policy: free shipping on orders
taking more than 5 working days; expedited shipping orders (an extra shipping
cost) are promised to be shipped within 1–3 working days. Thus, Fab is able to
split the order ﬂow and ensure the stability of their delivery timetable without
affecting customer satisfaction level.
Summary
From Fab.com’s case study, we can learn that e-commerce is a crucial opportunity
for business success. From the SCOM point of view, in order to fulﬁl the goal of
being a global company and remaining proﬁtable, the objectives of satisfying
customers with fast delivery and the right products, and achieving lowest costs and
highest margins should be achieved. Continuous improvement of cost structures is
critical to continue providing customers with exceptional service and beneﬁts, which
will result in the greatest possible long-term stakeholder value. Fab seems to focus on
developing successful supply-chain management with efﬁcient and effective inventory management, establishing supplier relationship management, investing in new
facilities for stocking items and information technology, and improving logistics, to
ensure a high level of customer satisfaction at minimal costs.

Homeplus: The Store Comes to Your Home

Tesco is known by the name Homeplus in South Korea and has adapted its business
model to better meet the needs and preferences of its local customers. In this regard,
the following three aspects are particularly relevant:
• long working hours and little spare time
• high technology acceptance
• high store rent in major cities.
The concept is based on establishing a virtual store using M-commerce technology in which shoppers can browse through pictures of available products at a public
place, in this case a subway station. The products can be selected by scanning the
QR-code with a smartphone which uses a mobile application to directly order the
selected products. The ordered products are then sent to the customer’s home within
the same day. Deliveries are arranged to arrive in minutes or hours, rather than days,
so the groceries will be in the shopper’s kitchen that night and there is no need to
wait in to collect them.
The virtual store perfectly ﬁts the expectations of the local customers: sales
increased 130% in 3 months, and the number of registered users went up by 76%.
The virtual M-commerce store might be more suitable for the Korean market than
most other markets. Yet the beneﬁts, such as shorter shopping times, convenient
order and payment services, and home delivery, may also become more and more
appreciated around the world as more and more countries reach similar smartphone
acceptance rates. From an SCM perspective, additional beneﬁts can be achieved.
Most notably, physical stores can be eliminated, leading to a more cost-efﬁcient
SC with direct shipping as a distribution strategy. The entire purchasing process can
be automated without any human intervention from the retailer’s side. With fewer
centralized distribution centers, higher customer service (product availability) rates
and reduced safety stock can be achieved. However, delivery costs for very small
quantities could become a serious issue depending on the customers’ order behavior
and stores’ delivery pricing policies.
Discussion:
• Consider the trade-offs between inventory costs, number of warehouses, and
transportation costs. Explain the efﬁciency issues in this case study based on
these trade-offs.
• Which distribution strategy is used by Homeplus in South Korea?
• Is it possible to implement a virtual store in your country? What challenges might
be encountered?

Amazon Robots

The US mega retailer Amazon has been consistently following a technological
automation approach for the last several years. By increasingly using robots at
their logistics centers, Amazon aims to achieve higher efﬁciency through cost
decreases and faster process ﬂows. However, the human workforce still plays an
important role within most of the processes at Amazons fulﬁllment centers (Singularity Hub 2017b).
Amazon started introducing higher numbers of robots to their logistic processes
in 2012, after acquiring the robotics company Kiva systems. In 2016, Amazon was
using about 45,000 robots at its fulﬁllment centers globally, which represents a 50%
increase compared to 30,000 robots used in 2015 (Quartz 2017b). Along with an
increase in robot use, the number of Amazon’s employees rose by about 50%
between 2015 and 2016. The greater need for human workforce is explained by
the fact that the increased use of robots led to a decrease in shipping costs, which
ﬁnally led to a higher demand for Amazon products (Singularity Hub 2017b).
The robots working at Amazon’s fulﬁllment centers are able to perform tasks
which are regular and predictable in a controlled environment. These tasks include
heavy lifting of packages, moving pallets between shelves, and shuttling goods from
one end of the warehouse to the other. Tasks which include judgement, unpredictability, and ﬁne motor skills still require a human workforce. Therefore, at Amazon’s
fulﬁllment centers, employees stock warehouse shelves according to how shelf space
can be optimally used. Additionally, employees are responsible for product packaging and loading of trucks (Singularity Hub 2017b).
Although many tasks are still completed by people, technology is consistently
improving, which could lead to robotic take overs in the near future. Amazon
recently applied for a patent for a self-learning robot, including an automatic
packaging system. This robot will be able to grab items ordered and package them
appropriately, while secure data provides the opportunity to save the ideal packaging
strategy of a product. Consequently, this task will no longer require a human
workforce. However, according to Amazon, employees have no reason to be afraid
of losing their jobs, as many tasks still require a human workforce, and additional
working ﬁelds, such as machine maintenance, are evolving (Business Insider 2017b).
In this present case, Amazon clearly demonstrates its strong focus on robotic
automation within the logistic processes, and this will continue into the future.
Besides the increased use of robots in fulﬁllment centers, drone delivery is one of
the retailer’s future automation ideas.
Discussion
• Why is Amazon increasingly using robots at their fulﬁllment centers?
• What challenges and potential problems exist?
• What are potential future opportunities and risks that come with increased
automation in logistic processes?

The Adidas Speedfactory is a pilot project of the German sports equipment manufacturer Adidas. This factory is a new and highly innovative form of product
manufacturing. It is based on an automatic production process which allows
manufacturing to move closer to consumer markets, and Adidas can now produce
faster than ever before (Adidas 2017).
Previously, the main manufacturing facilities of Adidas were located in Asia,
most of them in China, Vietnam, and Indonesia. In this context, the delivery of
ﬁnished sneakers to Germany took about 3 months. By building the new
Speedfactory in Ansbach, Germany, in an area belonging to the German industrial
company Oechseler, the completion time of one pair of sneaker is reduced to
5 h. Having a Speedfactory located in Germany, Adidas is now able to adapt
production more intensively to customers’ demands and wishes. As a single German
Speedfactory cannot compensate for all the preliminary manufacturing work being
done in Asian countries, the foreign facilities will be kept for the present (Welt
2016).
In stark contrast to the foreign production facilities, the production process at the
Speedfactory is almost entirely automatic, with half a dozen machines being part of
the shoe manufacturing. First, a knitting machine produces the fabric used for the
sneaker’s surface. Using a laser, another machine cuts the fabric into the correct
shape. Simultaneously, the shoe sole is put together from plastic on the other side of
the factory. With 160 employees working at the Speedfactory, the overall production
process requires fewer personnel than usual. In 2017, the Speedfactory started mass
producing with a planned annual output of 500,000 pairs of sneakers. Initially, the
Speedfactory will cover the production of more expensive and complex sneaker
models, such as running shoes, in order to achieve higher quality (Welt 2016).
The advantages of such a project are numerous. Storage of ﬁnished goods
becomes less important and even unnecessary since the Speedfactory, which is
local and fast, can produce the exact number of shoes that is actually sold. In
addition, personalized models can be delivered much more easily and quickly to
customers because of the short distance between production and customer. Another
economic advantage of the Speedfactory is an increase in efﬁciency because of the
ongoing work of the machines.
In 2017, another Speedfactory, this time in the USA, is planned to be completed.
Within the same year, the German Speedfactory will introduce the innovative
technology of 3D printing to its production process, taking the next step towards
fully high-tech and automatic manufacturing (Welt 2016).

Predictive Analytics and Machine Learning: RueLaLa
and Pharmapacks

Retailers must continuously strive to grow their revenue, margins, and market share.
One method for doing this is price optimization models, which calculate the variance
of demand as price levels rise or fall, and then combines this information with the
relevant cost and inventory data to recommend prices that could maximize revenue
and proﬁts. This case study from the online businesses Rue La La and Pharmapacks
highlights how these pricing models can be used for positive improvement.
Rue La La, an online fashion shop, offers limited-time, ﬂash discounts on
designer apparel and accessories. On the website, products are clustered according
to similarities and sold in “events,” or time limited sales on the clustered products. A
timer counts down how much time the customer has, usually 1–4 days, before the
sale event ends. These kind of businesses create a sense of urgency (great deals for a
short time) and the impression of product scarcity (low product inventory) (Johnson
et al. 2016).
Rue La La’s “ﬁrst exposure” items, or items which it is selling for the ﬁrst time,
generate most of the company’s sales. Pricing these particular items and
predicting what the demand for them will be is one of Rue La La’s greatest
challenges (Simchi-Levi and Wu 2018). For ﬁrst exposure items, learning from
customers’ online behavior by changing the price during the event is not a method
which Rue La La would like to use. Instead, they developed a demand prediction
model, where data about the ﬁrst exposure items is fed into the model to maximize
revenue. Challenges in developing this model included trying to estimate lost sales
resulting from stock outs, and predicting demand for new styles for which there was
no data (Simchi-Levi and Wu 2018). Today, the model is used daily to automatically
generate the best prices for events which will happen the next day. After
implementing this model, Rue La La’s revenue grew by 10%.
Similarly, the company Pharmapacks used a pricing software called “Master
Mind” to increase their market share and revenue. With 25,000 different products
sold and 570,000 orders shipped every month, the company works with 16 suppliers.
By using the software to calculate the best price for each their products and to
forecast demand, they now have six times the amount of sales they had in the past,
growing the company by 3035%, as well as increasing their revenue to $160 million
by 2016.

Introductory Case-Study: AirSupply

Each time an aircraft is made, it is the result of assembling a multitude of parts
representing a very large volume of orders. And what’s true for the aircraft assembly
line is true for the whole aerospace industry, where not only aircraft but also
helicopters and satellites are built. Parts for manufacturing come from multiple
suppliers from all over the world. Most of them are quite complex and need to fulﬁll
the highest quality standards. Each time delay can result in very high costs. It is
essential that all suppliers involved in the manufacture of an aircraft have real-time
visibility of demand and inventory to adapt to ﬂuctuations and changes of customer
requirements. As a result, it is also essential for customers and suppliers to have a

common tool that enables them to better collaborate and gain visibility over demand
as well as inventory (see Fig. 3.1).
One such tool is SupplyOn’s AirSupply solution which was developed in collaboration with Airbus/EADS and other major manufacturers and suppliers in the
European aerospace industry. If AirSupply is mainly characterized by the networking of the whole Aerospace & Defense supply line, its main innovation lies in the
fact that it provides all users with one single tool to view demand and inventory data.
The solution combines major new technologies such as cloud computing, software
as a service (SaaS), and e-procurement. It was developed in cooperation with
SupplyOn which had many years of experience with web-based SCM solutions in
the automotive industry.
AirSupply offers services for a number of SC processes, covering the entire
product cycle. The following main functions are provided (see Fig. 3.2):
• Forecast collaboration;
• E-Procurement;
• Vender managed inventory (VMI).

3.1.1

E-procurement

AirSupply is a solution for an integrated SC where e-procurement plays a crucial
role. Other than traditional procurement using enterprise resource planning (ERP)
and simple EDI (electronic data interchange) communication, the e-procurement
solution provides real-time visibility of demand ﬂuctuations and closer networking
between suppliers and customers who all have the same view on demand.

3.1 Introductory Case-Study: AirSupply

47

Fig. 3.2 Processes in supply chain management

Many of the other characteristics of the aerospace industry, such as complex parts
and high-quality standards, make SC visibility and collaboration crucial factors for
maintaining a competitive edge. Each airplane is produced according to individual
customer requirements and several million parts are required at the right time to
minimize inventories and prevent costly delays. Especially for suppliers using
expensive parts from other suppliers, the ﬁnancial risk can be high, but can be
mitigated through e-procurement.
The following description of the purchase order process shows how AirSupply
facilitates SC processes. After the customer creates the purchase order (PO) in their
ERP, three different scenarios can be supported by AirSupply:
• The supplier accepts the PO without changes.
• The supplier accepts the PO with changes. The customer either accepts or makes a
new proposal.
• The supplier accepts the PO without changes, but the customer requests a
modiﬁcation. The supplier can accept and dispatch the goods or the customer
can make a new proposal.
AirSupply automatically synchronises the PO information from the cloud to the
ERP system.

3.1.2

Vendor-Managed Inventory

The VMI process in particular shows a very strong need for integrated SC information systems (see Fig. 3.3).
In VMI, the supplier (or vendor) is responsible for managing the supply and
usually agrees with the customer on a minimum and a maximum inventory level.

48

3 Processes, Systems, and Models

Fig. 3.3 Vendor-managed inventory process

This requires that the suppliers have timely and accurate information on the
customer’s inventory levels at all times. AirSupply strongly supports this SCM
strategy by automatically advising suppliers when customers’ inventory levels are
critically low. Suppliers can also simulate deliveries to make adjustments prior to
actually dispatching goods.
Closer collaboration has helped reduce safety stock and improve service level
with the use of VMI. Manual work is also cut down as supplier data doesn’t need to
be entered and disputes linked to reception, inspection, and billing can be prevented.

3.1.3

Implementation

AirSupply is based on a Hybrid Cloud with SaaS (software as a service) solution that
allows the management of established internal processes. More than 1000 suppliers
were integrated into AirSupply by the end of 2012, and the solution connects all
major ﬁrms of the European aerospace industry and has become the dominant
platform. The common cloud platform enables standardized and integrated procurement processes while at the same time offering customized services to each individual company. Since cloud computing helps companies keep their hardware and
software investments lower and more ﬂexible, AirSupply offers a huge savings
potential. Furthermore, cloud computing providers can guarantee a high level of
data security and service reliability that a single company’s IT, especially of a
smaller company, could hardly do. At ﬁrst glance, cloud services are particularly
attractive for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) that want to access
massive computing power and specialized software with low ﬁxed costs. For larger
companies, the importance of having control over their IT infrastructure to secure
and protect crucial internal processes could rather outweigh the beneﬁts of cloud
computing. However, the hybrid cloud solution can achieve the best combination of
internal and external, ﬁxed and variable IT systems for any company.

Business Process Management

3.2.1

Process Optimization and Re-engineering

A process is a content and logic sequence of functions or steps that are needed to
create an object in a speciﬁed state. A business process is a network of activities for
accomplishing a business function. Processes have input and output parameters and
may be tied to one functional area or be cross-functional. Today companies are
organized on the basis of process. As said by W. Edwards Deming (Professor at
Columbia University; 1900–1993), “if you can‘t describe what are you doing as a
process, you don’t know what are you doing.”
Examples of processes include the following areas:
• Manufacturing and production, e.g., assembling the product;
• Sourcing, e.g., selecting suppliers;
• Human resources, e.g., hiring employees.
As an example, consider the process “Order fulﬁllment” (Fig. 3.4):
It can be observed that fulﬁlling a customer order involves a complex set of steps
that requires the close coordination of the sales, accounting, and manufacturing
functions. The basic concept for managing processes in an organization is called
business process management (BPM). BPM contains a variety of tools,
methodologies to analyze, design, and optimize processes. BPM is comprised of
the following steps (Hammer and Champy 1993):

costs,

ﬂexibility, and
sustainability.

The process analysis results may be characterized by effectiveness (the achievement of process goals) and efﬁciency (performing the process with minimum costs).
Processes that are both effective and efﬁcient are called optimal. Optimal processes
are characterized by effectiveness, efﬁciency, controllability, stability, ﬂexibility,
analyzability, observability, reliability, documentability, and continuous improvement capabilities.
Most of SCOM problems involve multiple objectives. The interrelation of
objectives is called a “trade-off,” which means that a manager has to ﬁnd a compromise. For example, it is very difﬁcult to achieve both low inventory and high
customer service levels, or both high capacity utilization and short lead-time.
"

Practical Insights Sustainability has become more and more important in
process optimization in production, logistics, and services. Consider two
apples in a German supermarket: an apple from South Africa and an
apple from Germany. Which apple is more sustainable? Different costs
such as transportation and warehousing costs should be considered in
the analysis. In autumn, the German apple would be more sustainable.
But in spring, the apple from South Africa is more sustainable, despite
transportation emissions, because of the high warehousing costs and the
corresponding energy consumption and emissions in Germany.

Process optimization in organizations is known as business process
re-engineering (BPR). BPR is an organization-wide philosophy of continuous process improvement. It is comprised of different views of process management such as
operational, organizational, ethical, etc.

3.2 Business Process Management

"

51

Practical Insights Options for process improvement frequently lie in
coordination. For example, in the automotive industry, the supply cycle
between a customer order and car delivery is approximately 60 days. The
car assembly itself accounts for only 2 of those days. This means that the
value-adding processes comprise less than 5% of the total supply cycle.
95% are planning and coordination activities. Great potential for optimization can be found in these activities.

In SCs, the following options can be considered for process improvement:
• SC design and conﬁguration (i.e., new market acquisition, lengthy time-to-market, non-resilient SC design);
• SC planning (weak ﬂow capacities and lengthy supply cycle);
• SC operations (false priorities for customers’ orders, imbalance of capacities and
order volumes, too frequent disruptions and high costs for recovery);
• SC performance evaluation (performance of different departments such as logistics, transport, and production is evaluated locally for each department without
any general links to the larger SCM perspectives); and
• SC execution (different levels of managers’ qualiﬁcations, false or incomplete
process documentation, weak consistency in process performance evaluation).

3.2.2

Business Process Modelling

In order to perform process optimization, as-is processes should be described.
Process models describe SCOM activities from an information processing perspective. Process modelling can be referred to as descriptive modelling and serves as an
interface for the development of information systems.
For business process modelling, a number of techniques and tools can be used.
The most popular of these are as follows:
•
•
•
•

SCOR (Supply Chain Operations Reference),
ARIS (Architecture of Information Systems),
UML (Uniﬁed Modelling Language) and
IDEF (Integration Deﬁnition for Function Modelling).

These approaches can also be used to model the workﬂow of decision making
processes. The process modelling serves to (1) describe processes and structures and
(2) clearly illustrate those entities. For these purposes, different solutions have been
developed, e.g., activity diagrams in UML and event-process chains (EPC) in ARIS.
The business process models typically have the following elements:

52

•
•
•
•
•

3 Processes, Systems, and Models

Activities—Transform resources and information of one type into another type
Decisions—A question that can be answered with Yes or No
Roles—Sets of procedures
Resources—People, or facilities, or computer programs assigned to roles
Repository—Collection of business records

One of the well-known models for describing SC processes and measuring their
performance is SCOR (Supply Chain Operations Reference Model) (see Fig. 3.5).
The SCOR model structure is not difﬁcult to understand. Just imagine you are
about to organize a party. What decisions are involved? First, we need to plan. Then
we need to source food and drinks. The next step is to hold the party. Finally, your
guests need to be delivered to their homes. The same principles are used in the SCOR
model structure. It contains a description of planning, sourcing, making, delivering,
and return processes in the SC at different levels of abstraction.
The main value of SCOR from the business process modelling point of view is
that the standardized business process models are interlinked at three levels. In
addition, a coherent system of performance indicators is correlated with the process
models. Finally, the data origins used to calculate the performance indicators are
explicitly provided. A SCOR project typically contains the following stages:
•
•
•
•

Business process modelling
Benchmarking analysis
Business process re-engineering

Management Information Systems

3.3.1

Role of Information Technology in Supply Chain
and Operations Management

53

SCOM managers say that where information is missing, material is also missing. A
universal property of the management processes, irrespective of the problem
domain, is that it has a notably informational nature, i.e. it is connected, ﬁrst of
all, with the collection, processing, analysis, and usage of data, information, and
knowledge.
Management Information Systems (MIS) collect, process, store, and distribute
information in order to support decision making, coordination, and control. MIS use
data, i.e. they are streams of raw facts. Information is data shaped into meaningful
form. For companies, MIS is an instrument for creating value. Investments in the
right information technology (IT) can result in superior returns in terms of productivity, revenue, and long-term strategic positioning. On the one hand, MIS automate
steps that were done manually before. On the other hand, MIS enable entirely new
processes by changing the ﬂow of information, replacing sequential steps with
parallel steps, eliminating delays in decision making, and support new business
models.

3.3.2

Types of Management Information Systems

The extensive development of IT for SCOM began in the 1980s. In the 1970s, ﬁrst
functions, such as accounting, were automated. In the 1980s, material requirements
planning (MRP), sales and operations planning (S&OP), and MES (manufacturing
execution systems) were developed. At the same time, additional functions, like
product design and quality control, have been captured under the umbrella of CIM
(computer integrated manufacturing).
Along with providing substantial advantages and help for managers, these
systems were so called “island solutions,” without integration with each other.
Since these systems used the same data to a great extent, in the 1990s, integrated
enterprise planning systems (ERP) were developed.
In the twenty-ﬁrst century, SCM sparked the development of APS (advanced
planning and scheduling) systems and different IT for SC collaboration. At present,
mobile technologies, Internet of Things, smart manufacturing and Industry 4.0,
Radio Frequency IDentiﬁcation, e-business, and cloud computing belong to the
trends of IT development for SCOM.
The variety of the existing IT can be distinguished according to the following
groups.

3.3.3

Management Information Systems and Organization

IT provide a new level of coordination capabilities in SCs and have enabled a
breakthrough in SC responsiveness and ﬂexibility. Modern IT can potentially enable
almost any integration and coordination concept. More important problems for
efﬁcient coordination lie in the organization sphere, collaboration culture, and trust.
First, the issues surrounding investments in IT infrastructure should be
highlighted. Primarily, this concerns the amount a company should spend on
IT. IT can be bought, but also rented or used via cloud computing. IT can also be
available via outsourcing. Whatever option is chosen, the total cost of ownership
(TCO) model should be used to analyze direct and indirect costs. Note that hardware
and software costs account for only about 20% of TCO. Other costs include

3.3 Management Information Systems

55

installation, training, support, maintenance, infrastructure, downtime, space, and
energy. TCO can be reduced by the use of cloud services, greater centralization,
and standardization.
Second, IT project management is a critical issue. As in any project management,
activities in an IT project include planning work, assessing risk, estimating resources
required, organizing the work, assigning tasks, controlling project execution,
reporting progress, and analyzing results. Five major variables for planning an IT
project are scope, time, cost, quality, and risk.
In spite of sophisticated project management, empirical data shows that 30–40%
of IT projects exceed schedule and/or budget or fail to perform as speciﬁed.
Frequently, the reasons are as follows: failure to capture essential business
requirements; failure to provide organizational beneﬁts; complicated, poorly
organized user interface; and inaccurate or inconsistent data.
A road map in an IT project should be elaborated at all the management levels and
include the following parts:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

Purpose of the plan
Strategic business plan rationale
Current systems/situation
New developments
Management strategy

Third, the issue of global organizations has become a critical challenge for many
IT infrastructures, especially in global SCs. Unfortunately, many companies fail to
build the right IT for their global SCs. As an example, consider a typical scenario of
disorganization on a global scale. A multinational consumer-goods company based
in United States and operating in Europe would like to expand into Asia. World
headquarters and strategic management are located in United States. The only
centrally coordinated information system is ﬁnancial controls and reporting. The
company is divided into separate regional, national production and marketing
centers. Foreign divisions have separate IT systems, e-business systems of different
divisions and centers are incompatible. In addition, each production facility uses
different ERP systems, different hardware, and so on.
Recommendations on the right way of organizing IT in global companies include
the following actions. First, it can be advised to share only core systems which
support functionality critical to the company: systems that share some key elements
can be partially coordinated. It is not advisable to have exactly the same systems
across national boundaries: local variation is desirable since IT must be adapted to
local requirements.

ERP Systems

Enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems are comprised of integrated software
modules and a common central database. ERP modules include but are not limited
to:
•
•
•
•
•
•

Production Management
Inventory Management
Sales
Human resources
Marketing
SCM.

The modules are like a number of USB sticks which can be purchased all together
or singulary. The working principle of ERP is based on the collection of data from
different departments of a ﬁrm for use in nearly all of the ﬁrm’s internal business
activities. The advantage is that information entered in one process is immediately
available for other processes. ERP uses
• master data (data not changed frequently, e.g., bill-of-materials) and
• process data (data changed operatively, e.g., current inventory level)
Advantages of ERP are as follows:
•
•
•
•
•
•

Provides integration of the SC, production, ﬁnance, and marketing;
Creates a commonality of databases;
Can incorporate improved best processes;
Increases communication and collaboration between business units and sites;
Has an off-the-shelf software database;
May provide a strategic advantage and increase company assets.
The limitations of ERP are as follows:

•
•
•
•
•
"

Can be very expensive to purchase and even more so to customize;
Implementation may require major changes in the company and its processes;
Can be so complex that many companies cannot adjust to it;
Involves an ongoing, possibly never completed, process for implementation;
Expertise is limited with ongoing stafﬁng problems.
Practical Insights An integrated ERP system is costly. Its implementation
will change organizational processes and structure. The project will take
into account many years. At the same time, there are many companies
with “self made” software for production planning, accounting, etc. The
question is whether we should buy new ERP or develop and integrate
self-made solutions? There is no absolute answer to this question. There

3.3 Management Information Systems

57

are companies which develop their own solutions. In other cases, new
ERP projects are successful. The key success factors depend much on the
correspondence of the existing IT to the current and future needs of the
company. It is also important how qualified and organized the IT department at the firm is.

3.3.5

APS Systems

At the beginning of the twenty-ﬁrst century, SCM topics became more and more
important. Some important modules such as “SC design” and “Distribution
planning” were missing in ERP. In addition, ERP provided very limited support
for mathematical optimization in scheduling. ERP also had other restrictions, such as
planning against unlimited capacities. That is why a new generation of APS systems
has been developed (Stadtler et al. 2015) (see Fig. 3.6).
An APS extracts data from ERP and uses it for optimization. Consider this
example of scheduling in APS (see Fig. 3.7):
APS system:
• extracts some input data from different ERP modules,
• performs automatic calculations on the basis of scientiﬁc optimization methodology, and
• generates reports.
APS modules are mainly dedicated to deterministic planning. However, there are
uncertainties on both the inbound (unreliable suppliers, machine breakdowns) and
the outbound (unknown customer demand) sides. In order to hedge against

uncertainty, buffers have to be installed—either in the form of safety stocks or safety
times.
Practical application of APS is not easy. First, there is a discrepancy between the
expectations of companies and the capabilities of the software. Second, optimization
models can often not be solved within reasonable time limits, especially if interactive
planning is desired. Third, the willingness to share information, e.g. about costs or
capacities, is often rather limited. Problems also arise in using generic model
formulations, which are often not sufﬁciently tailored to the needs of the speciﬁc
application environment. APS appear to be most successful for intra-company SCs
with centralized logistics control (Günther 2005).

3.3.6

SCEM and RFID

ERP and APS systems support activities planning. For real-time control, other
systems are used. We consider two IT solutions for the control stage: SCEM and

3.3 Management Information Systems

59

RFID. Supply Chain Event Management (SCEM) aims at timely identiﬁcation of
deviations in SCs. The basis for disruption alerts and disruption recovery is a
tolerance area of execution parameters’ admissible deviations. SCEM is composed
of ﬁve main functions:
•
•
•
•
•

monitoring of processes;
notiﬁcation about an impermissible parameter deviation;
simulating possible adjustment actions;
selecting a control action to eliminate the deviation;
measuring on the basis of performance indicators.

SCEM is based on three main drivers. First, tracking and tracing (T&T) systems,
RFID, and mobile devices are used to provide current information about process
execution. Second, the method of management by exception is used to ﬁlter information and to compare actual parameter values with planned ones. Third, the method
of event-oriented planning is used to identify sensitive adjustment actions in the case
of negative events.
One of the basic technologies for facilitating feedback in SC execution is RFID.
In recent years, applications and research literature on RFID have grown exponentially. RFID is an automatic identiﬁcation technology composed of RFID tags and
specialized RFID readers. Tags are also called RFID transponders (abbreviation of
transmitters-responders). Tags are attached to or incorporated into any kind of object
(product, tool, animal, goods, human being, etc.) for the purpose of identiﬁcation
and tracking using radio waves. RFID readers read the information on tags and
transfer it to a processing device. When applied to SCOM, RFID technology can
provide several crucial advantages, but also has limitations (see Table 3.1).
The common target of RFID is to reduce costs created by manual operating,
accelerate data receipt and transmission, and increase the preciseness and quality of
data. RFID technology allows the tracking of products throughout the SC from
supplier delivery to warehouses and points of sale. This contributes to the reduction
of uncertainty concerning ﬂuctuations in processes, improvement in the readability
of the quantity and quality of items produced, improvements in safety (in particular,
reduction of counterfeiting), and reduction of waste and theft. Some relevant ﬁgures
are listed below:
• The reduction of error when picking a product in inventory is 5%.
• Thefts at retailers are reduced by 11–18%.
• Shrinkage at retailers decreases to 0.78% from 1.69%.

• Thefts from shelves decrease by 9–14 % while the reduction ranges between 40%
and 59% in stores.
• Stock availability increases by 5–10%.
RFID is also believed to provide crucial beneﬁts in ensuring SC stability/continuity by means of improved information sharing and SC monitoring support through
a faster exception management. SCs can potentially become more ﬂexible, responsive, agile, and secure by applying RFID.
Reduction of labor cost due to RFID is evaluated at 30%, 17%, or 7.5%, in
distribution depending on the study for retail stores. Other estimations claim that
saving in receipt of products in inventory facilities is 7.5% or 5–40%, depending on
the study. Other ﬁgures state 9% in manufacturing, 90% or 100% in physical
inventory counting, 0.9–3.4% in stores.
At the same time, the existing studies underline that RFID does neither explain
nor solve the ﬂuctuations of customer demand, transportation times, and inventory
levels. It identiﬁes and processes the data in the volume according to the tags,
readers, and middleware functionalities, and at the places where they are installed.
RFID also does not propose any control actions that should be taken to adapt a SC in
the event of changes or disruptions at the execution stage.

3.3.7

Business Analytics and E-Business

During the last decade, new IT for SCOM has been developed. Details of managerial
and technical implementation on these technologies differ, but most of them share
attributes of intelligence. Since SCOM depends on the use of IT, in the coming years
these new tools will change the landscape of managerial concepts and decision
support systems for SCOM. Associating (and even embedding) IT and intelligence
into SC planning and organizational structures has been discussed for over 10 years
now. However, questions remain about the beneﬁts and obstacles in allowing orders,
deliveries and products to be able to plan and control their own progress through a
SC. With new IT, data management becomes a competitive advantage for
companies. Trends in IT development for SCOM include:
•
•
•
•

Business Intelligence (BI) and Big Data Analytics,
Cloud computing and SaaS (software as a service),
E-Business, net marketplaces (e-hubs) and virtual enterprises,
IoS—Internet of Services/Internet of Things and Industry 4.0.

BI comprises data and software tools for organizing and analyzing data. It is used
to help managers and users make improved decisions. Presently, so called Big Data
Analytics (cf. Chap. 16) are becoming more and more important. Data mining
belongs to the group of business analytics that is comprised of tools and techniques
for analyzing data.

3.3 Management Information Systems

61

With the help of cloud computing, hardware/software can be used as a service
without buying IT. This allows companies to minimize IT investments. The
drawbacks are concerns about security and reliability.
E-business consists of the use of digital technology and the internet to drive major
business processes.
"

Practical Insights In many e-commerce service SCs, especially in startups, the managers focus rather on the link between warehouses and
customers and frequently undervalue the link between suppliers and
warehouses. In manufacturing SCs the focus is rather on the link between
suppliers and production, and the customer may play an
underemphasized role in SCOM decisions. It is therefore important to
consider integrating the SC from suppliers to customers for both service
and manufacturing SCs.

E-commerce is a subset of e-business and consists of buying and selling goods
and services through the Internet. Presently, M-Commerce solutions are being
developed to include mobile IT into SCOM. In order to implement e-business,
Electronic data interchange (EDI) technology is used. EDI ensures computer-tocomputer exchange of standard transactions such as invoices, or purchase orders.
Major industries have EDI standards that deﬁne structure and information ﬁelds of
electronic documents. More companies are increasingly moving toward private
networks that allow them to link to a wider variety of ﬁrms than EDI allows and
share a wider range of information in a single system.
"

Practical Insights Consider an example. Harley Davidson was facing
problems with its suppliers, as the relationships were subpar and unsophisticated. Engineers focused on the suppliers’ technical innovations
and failed to consider whether they could produce the necessary volume, deliver on schedule, or meet cost targets. As a result, supplier
components came in late and production was often put at risk. To
resolve this problem, the company developed an internet-based SCM
strategy where a web portal was created which enabled Harley Davidson
and its suppliers to conduct transactions, from placing purchase orders
to invoicing, on the internet. Nearly 300 of Harley’s 695 parts suppliers
logged into applications through the supplier portal. Suppliers can view
production forecasts, account statuses, and are able to submit shipment
notices and receive inventory-replenishment alerts. The web-portal has
allowed Harley to achieve lower costs, consistent quality, and improved
delivery performance.

62

3 Processes, Systems, and Models

Net marketplaces (e-hubs) are single markets for many buyers and sellers. They
can be industry-owned or owned by an independent intermediary. E-hubs generate
revenue from transaction fees and other services. The market principle uses prices
established through negotiation, auction, or ﬁxed prices.
In many industries, hierarchical SCs with predetermined suppliers’ structures and
long-term product programs evolve into virtual enterprises and collaborative
networks. Their special feature is a customer-oriented networking of core
competences and ﬂexible, conﬁgurable SCs, conditioned by an enlargement of
alternatives for searching for suitable partners with whom a cooperation enabled
by Internet technologies is possible.
The main objective of a virtual enterprise is to allow a number of organizations to
develop a common working environment or virtual breeding environment with the
goal of maximizing ﬂexibility and adaptability to environmental changes and developing a pool of competencies and resources. SCs in virtual enterprise are based on a
customer-oriented networking of core competences through partner selection from a
pool of available suppliers in a virtual environment according to customer
requirements. Virtual enterprises focus on speed and ﬂexibility. A virtual enterprise
is enabled by building a united information space with extensive usage of web
services.
Virtual enterprise structures are highly dynamic and their life cycles can be very
short. Remarkable are alternatives for SC conﬁguration. It is a great advantage to
react quickly to customers’ requirements. A virtual enterprise also builds a
structural-functional reserve for the running of a SC. Unfortunately, virtual
enterprises are mostly considered from the information perspective and don’t deal
properly with managerial and organizational factors. Our practical experiences show
that there are only a few (if any) organizations that have managed to apply the
primary idea of a virtual enterprise, but these often collaborate only a short time and
then disperse, perhaps to form new networks with other enterprises. Two main
obstacles cause this dispersal: trust and technical project documentation.
The development of the Internet of Things in a manufacturing context has been
called Industry 4.0 with reference to the three prior industrial revolutions: the steam
machine, assembly line manufacturing, and computer integrated manufacturing
(CIM). Even in our everyday life, WLAN-based communication between different
devices such as refrigerators, kitchen stoves, and smartphones is possible. In Industry 4.0 manufacturing, both machines and materials are equipped with
interconnected sensors in cyber-physical systems, take an active role in the process,
and optimize it. The products and the machines communicate to each other.
Materials will be able to communicate their purpose to the machines, making
product lifecycles faster and more ﬂexible. An important component of Industry
4.0 is additive manufacturing technology, especially 3D printing.
"

Practical Insights Business Analytics and Industry 4.0 are expected to be
path-breaking concepts for SCOM in the near future. All management
activities are about data and information. By now, state-of-the-art IT

3.4 Problem Solving Methods and Research Methodologies

63

allow storing and transmitting huge amounts of data. Managers must
analyze all this data to extract what’s necessary, and transfer it into
information. In the future, managers will get the information they need
at the right place, at the right time, and at the right quality. The preliminary actions for sorting and combining data will be done automatically
by Business Analytics and Industry 4.0.

3.4

Problem Solving Methods and Research Methodologies

A baker bakes bread. A bus driver drives the bus. What do managers do? They make
decisions. Decisions are made to solve problems. Decisions can be made regarding
planning and control of operations and SCs. In this paragraph we learn the basic
problem solving methods in SCOM.

3.4.1

Problems, Systems, and Decision-Making

For a problem to exist there must be an individual (or a group of individuals). This
person is referred to as the problem owner(s) (decision maker) who:
• is dissatisﬁed with the current state of affairs within a real-life context, or has
some unsatisﬁed present or future needs, i.e. who has some goals to be achieved
or targets to be met;
• is capable of judging when these goals, objectives, or targets have been met to a
satisfactory degree; and
• has control over some aspects of the problem situation that affect the extent to
which the goals, objectives, or targets can be achieved (Daellenbach and
McNickle 2005).
Rather than assume that we have a well-structured problem with clearly deﬁned
objectives and alternative courses of action, it is better to:
• represent the problem situation where issues are still vague or fuzzy;
• gain a comprehensive understanding of the various issues involved in decision
making;
• formulate the problem correctly to ensure an appropriate level of detail and
provide insights into the problem solution;
• perform decision making within the context of systems.
Most problems exist in the system context. A system is a set of interrelated
components, which make up a united whole. Each component interacts with or is
related to at least one other component and they all serve a common objective.

64

3 Processes, Systems, and Models

Environment is the aggregate of elements that do not belong to the system, but
inﬂuence it.
One basic system characteristic is structure. Structure is the characteristic of
steady links and interaction modes of a system’s elements; structure determines
the system’s integrity, organization, and functioning; structure is the framework of a
system. In practice, many SC structures are disrupted (e.g., Toyota’ SC was badly
affected by the tsunami in March 2011), and this concerns the SC’s structure
dynamics (Ivanov et al. 2010).
Dynamics is a system’s change and evolution in object and process states in space
and time as driven by the perturbation and control inﬂuences resulting from both
planned transition from a current state to a desired one, or adaptation of a system to a
changed execution environment.
Decision is the selection of an activity (or a set of activities) from several
alternatives. Decisions are subject to constraints which limit decision choices and
objectives which make some decisions preferable to others. Managerial decisions
affect system goal-orientation through output performance. Decisions shape system
behavior with regard to a certain goal (or multiple goals). Objectives and criteria play
the most important role in making decisions.
"

Practical Insights Each management decision has two components. The
first one is an analytical component and the second one is a behavioral
component. The analytical component is supported by quantitative
analysis business analytics methods, while the behavioral component is
based on the intuition and leadership qualities of the decision-maker as
well as on external environment behavior prediction and reaction in
regard to the decisions of suppliers, retailers, and customers.

Performance is a complex characteristic of the goal oriented results of the
system’s functioning. Managers must consider potential and real performance, and
take into account the conformity of the achieved results with the goals set by
management at the planning stage. Performance is measured with certain metrics
or indicators (e.g., customer service level, on-time delivery, costs, etc.)
Basic problems in decision making are as follows:
•
•
•
•

optimality,
multiple objectives,
risk and uncertainty, and
complexity.

3.4.1.1 Optimal Decisions and Multiple Objectives
The optimal decision is the best one. Optimal decisions are very “fragile” and
presume certain problem dimensionality, fullness, and the certainty of the model.
In addition, optimal solutions are usually very sensitive to deviations. Moreover,

3.4 Problem Solving Methods and Research Methodologies

65

decision making is tightly interconnected with dynamics and should be considered
as an adaptive tuning process and not as a “one-way” optimization.
"

Practical Insights Consider an example. Determining the optimal order
quantity for some purchased items is a typical optimization problem. This
optimization is based on the reduction of ordering and inventory holding
costs, and, if so, the calculated order quantity is optimal only for the
purchasing department. At the same time, this problem is tightly
interconnected with transportation planning and customer service
level improvement. So the real problem situation which exists is
integrated inventory optimization.

The problems of applying optimization-based decision making are interrelated
with complexity, uncertainty, and multiple objectives. A particular feature of optimal
decisions is multi-objective decision making by managers with their own preferences
that, in their turn, are always changing. Hence, it becomes impossible to build any
general selection function for multi-criteria decision making. Finding optimal
solutions is possible, but it can be very time-consuming. However, these optimal
solutions can be used for benchmarking to estimate the quality of solutions obtained
by heuristics or simulation models (see further in this chapter).
Multiple objectives conﬂict in the sense that they create a competition for
common resources to achieve variously different performance objectives (ﬁnancial,
functional, environmental, etc.). A multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) strategy
employs trade-off analysis techniques to identify compromise designs for which the
competing criteria are mutually satisﬁed in a Pareto-optimal sense. One example of
an up-to-date technique for MCDM is TOPSIS. For more detailed information on
decision making theory, we refer to the studies on operations research, decision
theory, and quantitative analysis in management, e.g., Taha (2009), Render et al.
(2012), Dolgui and Proth (2010), Yalaoui et al. (2012).

3.4.1.2 Risk and Uncertainty
Uncertainty is one of the most critical issues in making decisions. Uncertainty is a
system property characterizing the incompleteness of our knowledge about the
system and the conditions of its development. Uncertainty is a polysemic term
(poly—many, sema—a sign). Historically, the ﬁrst terms related to uncertainty
were accident, probability, and possibility, which we relate to Aristotle. Until the
twentieth century, the mathematical basics and factor description of uncertainty were
founded on probability-frequency interpretation and were related to Pascal, Ferma,
Bernoulli, and Laplace. Modern probability theory is based on the research of
Kolmogorov, who introduced an axiomatic deﬁnition of probability as a measure
related to a system of axioms of a so-called probability space.
Uncertainty begets risk. Risk management is a methodological approach for
managing uncertain outcomes. The concept of risk is subject to various deﬁnitions.

66

3 Processes, Systems, and Models

Knight (1921) classiﬁed “measurable” uncertainty as “risk.” From the ﬁnancial
perspective of Markowitz (1952), risk is the variance of return. From the project
management perspective, risk is a measure of the probability and consequence of not
achieving a deﬁned project goal. According to March and Shapira (1987), risk is a
product of the probability of occurrence of a negative event and the resulting amount
of damage.
Generally, in decision theory, risk is a measure of the set of possible (negative)
outcomes from a single rational decision and their probabilistic values. A particular
feature of risk management in SCs (unlike in technical systems) is that people do not
strive for a 100% guarantee of the result: they consciously tend to take risks. There is
a problem of contradiction between objective risk (determined by experts, applying
quantitative scientiﬁc means) and perceived risk (perception of managers).
There are three types of uncertainty which affect SCOM (Klibi et al. 2010; Dolgui
et al. 2018):
• random uncertainty (i.e., problem in demand and supply coordination);
• hazard uncertainty (unusual events with high impact, i.e., ripple effect (Ivanov
et al. 2014; Ivanov 2017a, b, 2018; Dolgui et al. 2018);
• deep uncertainty (severe disruptions) no information (game theory and utility
functions).
According to the certainty of data, the following cases can be classiﬁed:
•
•
•
•

no information (treated in game theory and utility functions);
vague information (treated in fuzzy theory);
random and stochastic information (treated in probability theory);
determined information (treated in analytical models).
Uncertainty factors are usually divided into two groups:

• stochastic factors and
• non-stochastic factors.
The ﬁrst group can be described via probability models. For the formal description of non-stochastic uncertainty, fuzzy description with known membership
functions, subjective probabilities for the uncertainty factors, interval description,
and a combined description of the uncertainty factors are used.

3.4.2

Models and Modeling

The concept of a model is widely applicable in natural human languages and is a
general scientiﬁc term. It is characterized by polysemy, that is, widely expressed and
reﬂecting different meanings depending on the applications and contexts. At present,
there are several hundred deﬁnitions of the concept of a model and modelling. To

3.4 Problem Solving Methods and Research Methodologies

67

sum up the different deﬁnitions, the following views of models and modelling are
presented.
A model is:
• a system whose investigation is a tool for obtaining information about another
system;
• a method of knowledge existence; and
• a multiple system map of the original object that, together with absolutely true
content, contains conditionally true and false content, which reveals itself in the
process of its creation and practical use.
Modelling is one of the stages of cognitive activity of a subject, which involves
the development (choice) of a model, use of it to conduct investigations, obtainment
and analysis of the results, production of recommendations, and estimation of the
quality of the model itself as applied to the solved problem and taking into account
speciﬁc conditions (Fig. 3.8).
Because of the ﬁniteness of the designed (applied) model (a limited number of
elements and relations that describe objects belonging to inﬁnitely diverse reality)
and the limited resources (temporal, ﬁnancial, and material) supplied for modelling,
the model always reﬂects the original object in a simpliﬁed and approximate way.
However, experience shows that these speciﬁc features of a model are admissible
and do not oppose the solution of problems that are faced by subjects.

3.4.3

Model-Based Decision Making

For each decision, managers use both quantitative and qualitative models. Quantitative analysis is a scientiﬁc approach to managerial decision making in which raw
data is processed and manipulated to produce meaningful information. Consider the
following example.

Case Study “Redesigning the Material Flow in a Global Manufacturing
Network”
Problem Description
Consider an enterprise that produces systems for energy transmission and has two
locations: factory A is located in Europe and factory B is located in China. Both
factories have deep manufacturing penetration; in other words, they are able to
produce almost all the components and modules needed for the ﬁnal product
assembly. Both factories can assemble the same ﬁnal products from the same
components, known as shared components. The ﬁnal assembly always takes place
in the country where the customer builds its energy system. Whether the production
of the shared components can be distributed within the network so that total network
costs are minimized should be analyzed.
Model Development
Each manager applies both quantitative and qualitative methods for each decision. From the mathematical point of view, the problem can be represented as a
number of origin points with some given capacities and destination points with some
given demand. The production volumes should be delivered to the customers in such
a way that total costs are minimized. This is a well known problem in operations
research, namely the transportation problem. At the same time, the problem also
comprises costs and risks which cannot be quantiﬁed within an optimization model,
and therefore additional qualitative analysis is needed.
Input Data
At the ﬁrst stage, four options for process design have been formulated:
1.
2.
3.
4.

Local manufacturing at A and B
Manufacturing at A for A and B
Manufacturing at B for A and B
Mixed manufacturing at A and B for A and B.
For the development of the mathematical model, the following data is needed:

•
•
•
•
•

origin points
destination points
production capacity at the origin points Ai
demand at the destination points Bj
costs for production and transportation of a product unit from Ai to Bj.

Solution Development
The particular feature of the problem considered is that origin and destination
points are actually identical. The model has then the standard format of the transportation problem and can be solved with the help of Excel Solver. Final decisions
should be made based on analysis of both quantitative optimization results and
managerial qualitative analysis.

Fig. 3.9 Model-based decision-making process

From the point of view of cost efﬁciency, option 2 should be selected. However,
there are some crucial risks. First, a single sourcing strategy is very risky since
production and delivery shortages can occur. Second, if manufacturing in Germany
should be relaunched, implementation costs would be very high.
The model-based decision making process is shown in Fig. 3.9.
We can observe that a real management problem is the initial point of the
decision-making process. An example might be a facility location problem where
we are given demand in some markets, possible locations and capacities of new
facilities, ﬁxed costs of having a facility in the SC, and transportation costs from each
location to each market. We must decide where to locate the facilities and which
quantities should be shipped from the facilities to the markets.
The next step is to transform the real problem into a mathematical model. For this
transformation, we need to reduce the complexity of reality. This inevitably results in
simpliﬁcation. For example, we would assume deterministic capacity in our facility
location model instead of considering ﬂuctuations in demand.
We make this simpliﬁcation in order to represent the management problem in
such a way that the model can be solved with the help of existing algorithms within a
reasonable time. In our example, we formulate the facility location problem as a
mixed-integer linear programming model that can be solved with the help of simplex
and branch&bound algorithms.
For implementation, software is needed. Small instances can be solved with the
help of Excel Solver, but for real data, a professional solver such as CPLEX, Lindo,
AMPL, Matlab, GAMS, Gurobi, and XPRESS exist. The software calculates the
solution. In our example, the solution is suggestions on where to open facility
locations and which product quantities should be shipped from each opened location
to each of the markets so that total production and logistics costs are minimal.
The software calculates this solution. The most important question now is
whether this solution is automatically our decision? NO! This is a solution to the
mathematical problem. For the next stage, management expertise is needed to
transfer this mathematical solution into managerial decisions. First of all,
simpliﬁcations of reality should be reviewed. Second, so called soft facts such as
risks, ﬂexibility, etc. should be included in the analysis. That is why we prefer
talking about decision-supporting quantitative methods.

3 Processes, Systems, and Models

Quantitative Models and Operations Research

Quantitative models for SCOM can be divided into three primary approaches. These
are optimization, simulation, and heuristics. Hybrid models (e.g., optimization-based
simulation models) also exist. Optimization is an analysis method that determines
the best possible option of solving a particular operations or SC problem. Optimization has been a very visible and inﬂuential topic in the ﬁeld of SCOM. The drawback
of using optimization is difﬁculty in developing a model that is sufﬁciently detailed
and accurate in representing the complexity and uncertainty of SCM, while keeping
the model simple enough to be solved.
Simulation imitates the behavior of one system with another. By making changes
to the simulated SC, one can gain an understanding of the dynamics of the physical
SC. Simulation is an ideal tool for further analyzing the performance of a proposed
design derived from an optimization model (Sterman 2000; Ivanov 2016, 2017a, b).
Heuristics are intelligent rules that often lead to good, but not necessarily the best,
solutions. Heuristic approaches typically are easier to implement and require less
data. However, the quality of the solution is usually unknown. An option for
estimating the quality of heuristic algorithms may be the usage of optimization as
a tool for “ideal” solutions to problems.
Operations Research (OR) is the application of advanced analytical methods to
help make better decisions (INFORMS deﬁnition). OR deals with problems that may
be described with mathematical models to ﬁnd optimal or good solutions. An
overview of OR-based methods is presented in Fig. 3.10. Basic OR methods and
their application to SCOM include but are not limited to:
•
•
•
•
•
•

Linear programing (production planning; revenue management)
Integer programing/Combinatorial Optimization (scheduling, routing)
Mixed integer linear programing (MILP) (SC design)
Dynamic programing/Graph Theory (dynamic lot-sizing/SC contracting)
Network theory (project management)
Queuing theory (waiting lines: call centers, hotline services, process design,
entertainment parks, services)
• Simulation (SC design, bullwhip-effect, etc.)
• Heuristics (genetic algorithms, ant colony optimization (ACO), application to
scheduling and routing problems)
• Fuzzy/Robust/Stochastic optimization (data uncertainty).
The application of many of these methods to different SCOM problems will be
considered in further chapters of this book.

Methods of decisions making support in SCOM
IT in SCOM.

Before starting to consider processes and decision-supporting methods in details,
let us summarize our knowledge according to the triangle “Process!Model!IT”.
Process modelling and re-engineering are basic preliminaries for the successful
application of quantitative models and IT. All three of these components are tightly
interrelated with each other. The main blocks required for successful SCOM are
presented in Fig. 3.11.
Many companies make a mistake by starting optimization directly with
IT. However, before this, which data is necessary for which optimization models
must be determined. Next, this data should be brought into correspondence with
business processes and organizational structure.
In the block “Enterprise Supply Chain,” typical functionality of ERP and APS
systems can be used. In the block “Integrated SC,” special EDI-driven software for
SC coordination and collaboration are required. Finally, the block “Services and
analytics” is responsible for reporting, data management, and KPI (key performance
indicator) control. All of these models are based on business process models and
mathematical models. Data management also comprises integration with some
external IT like RFID, payment security systems, etc.
In Table 3.2, we summarize quantitative methods used in select modules of the
SCOM information system.
In the next chapters of this book, we will learn many of these problems, models
and methods in detail.

Research Methodologies

Quantitative methods, modeling and optimization are popular ways of conducting
research in SCOM. Other research methodologies are qualitative-oriented and
include case-study research, action research, surveys, and interview-based research
(Kotzab et al. 2005; Yin 2014).
Case-study research is based on deductive analysis of existing practical examples
described in literature. A single case, several isolated cases, or even embedded cases
can be analyzed to develop general recommendations for a problem.
Action research presumes the active participation of the investigator in the
problem solving. It can be, e.g., a traineeship in a company where students are
involved in a project. Unlike in case-study research, the results of the project are
typically unknown at the beginning. In an ongoing project, comparison of “as-is”
and “to-be” states can be complicated. Benchmarking analysis can be successfully
used here.
Surveys and interview-based research presumes data collection from different
sources, e.g., interviews of experts in a particular area. The questionnaires are
designed and evaluated with the help of statistical methods. Frequently, the structural equation method is used.

Integration of Business Analytics, Simulation,
and Optimization

Success in SC competition is highly dependent on analytics algorithms in combination with optimization and simulation modelling. Initially intended for process
automation, business analytics techniques now disrupt markets and business models
and have a signiﬁcant impact on SCM development.
"

Practical Examples Electronic retailers use their extensive customer

transactional and behavioral data to offer new ways of trying,
experiencing, and purchasing their products (e.g., Amazon with Alexa).
PwC works with a large car company looking to introduce autonomous
vehicles for the public (Wilkinson 2018). Part of this work employs deep
reinforcement learning to develop rules. Together with simulation, deep
reinforcement learning is used to determine “optimal” decision rules that
allow the vehicles to maximize efficiency while also satisfying customer
trip demand. The software environment for the project uses the extensible and practical environment of AnyLogic multi-method simulation
software to lever the capabilities of DL4J for the deep learning environment. Autonomous cars are becoming more common and the features
are already in many consumer cars. Artificial intelligence (AI) becomes
more pervasive in the real world with every project, and necessarily it
must be part of simulation. This means AI will not only be part of
simulations, but simulation will also help to develop the AI.

3.5 Integration of Business Analytics, Simulation, and Optimization

Fig. 3.12 Supply chain and operations analytics

In the past decades, simulation and optimization have played signiﬁcant roles in
solving complex problems in SCOM. Successful examples include production
planning and scheduling, supply chain design, and routing optimization, to name a
few. However, many problems remain challenging because of their complexity and
large scales, and/or uncertainty and stochastic nature. On the other hand, the rapid
rise of business analytics provides exciting opportunities for Operations Research
and the reexamination of these hard optimization problems, as well as newly
emerging problems in SCOM (Fig. 3.12).
Examples of SC and operations analytics applications include logistics and SC
control with real-time data, inventory control and management using sensing data,
dynamic resource allocation in Industry 4.0 customized assembly systems, improving forecasting models using Big Data, machine learning techniques for process
control, SC visibility and risk control, optimizing systems based on predictive
information (e.g., predictive maintenance), combining optimization and machine
learning algorithms, and simulation-based modeling and optimization for stochastic
systems (Ivanov et al. 2018).

76

3 Processes, Systems, and Models

The application areas of Supply Chain and Operations Analytics can be classiﬁed
into four areas, i.e.,:
•
•
•
•

Descriptive and diagnostic analysis,
Predictive simulation and prescriptive optimization,
Real time control, and
Adaptive learning.

Sourcing, manufacturing, logistics, and sales data are distributed among very
different systems, such as ERP, RFID, sensors, and blockchain. Big Data Analytics
integrates this data to information used by artiﬁcial intelligence algorithms in the
cyber SC and managers in the physical SC (cf. Fig. 3.12; see also Chap. 16). As such,
a new generation of simulation and optimization models have arisen. The pervasive
adoption of analytics and its integration with Operations Research shows that
simulation and optimization are key, not only in the modeling of physical SC
systems, but also in the modeling of cyber SC systems and for learning them.

3.6

Key Points

Organizations are structured by processes. Any organization or business strategy is
inﬂuenced by technology. A business process is a network of activities for
accomplishing a business function. The basic concept of managing processes in an
organization is called business process management and includes a variety of tools,
methodologies to analyze, design, and optimize processes. The analysis of process
results may be characterized by effectiveness (the achievement of process goals) and
efﬁciency (performing the process with minimum costs). Process models describe
SCOM activities from an information processing perspective.
At the enterprise level, such MIS as ERP, WMS, and TPS systems are used. At
the SC level, APS and SCEM systems can be applied. During the last decade, new IT
for operations and SC integration have been developed. Examples include data
mining, cloud computing, physical internet, pattern recognition, knowledge discovery, and early warning systems, to name a few. Trends in IT development for SCOM
include Business Intelligence and data mining, cloud computing and SaaS,
E-Business, and Industry 4.0.
For each decision, managers use both quantitative and qualitative models. Quantitative methods are based on Operations Research techniques. Qualitative research
methodologies include case-study, action, and survey research.

Zara’s Three Success Factors: Speed, Speed, and Speed

Zara is a global fashion retailer which sells its goods around the world. The retailer’s
international footprint proves that national borders are no hindrance to a shared
fashion culture. Founded in 1975, the Spanish retailer Zara has stores strategically
located in leading cities across the continents (https://www.inditex.com/brands/
zara), launches more than 10,000 new designs each year, and is recognized as one
of the world’s principal fashion retailers. It belongs to the INDITEX Group, which
also holds common brand names like Pull&Bear, Bershka, and Stradivarius.

Operations and Supply Chain Strategy

Zara is well known for its up-to-the minute styles and products. The main key to
their corporate strategy is their SC strategy. The following statement by INDITEX
gives the ﬁrst hint of this exclusive strategy: “Our approach to fashion—creativity,
quality design and rapid turnaround to adjust to changing market demands—has
allowed us to expand internationally at a fast pace and has generated an excellent
public response to our retailers’ collections” (Inditex 2014).
While many retailers design and produce around 80% of their season’s inventory,
Zara keeps back 50% to be produced in the middle of the season. This way they can
react if, for example, the hot trend of the current season is skinny instead of boot-cut
jeans. A full team of fashion experts keeps an eye on upcoming trends in each
country on university campuses, night clubs, and fashion shows. All research and
design activities are steered from Zara’s headquarters in La Coruña in Spain. For
production, Zara has its own high tech factories and a number of subcontractors.
However, Zara keeps outsourcing to a minimum and produces primarily in developed countries to provide better quality control. To keep responsiveness at the
highest level, many garments are kept in a generic unprinted stage. This approach
is called postponement strategy, since products can be modiﬁed from generic to
ﬁnished according to customer demand.
Procurement ofﬁces in the UK, China, and the Netherlands deal with all purchasing activities. In manufacturing, Zara links the two sites of SC strategies. On one site
they import 40% of their products as ﬁnished goods from low-cost countries. This
strategy is used for “basics,” or products that are unchanged by fashion trends such
as white and black T-shirts. All other materials are bought from Mauritius,
New Zealand, Australia, Morocco, China, India, Turkey, Korea, Italy, and Germany.
Zara tries to source locally instead of globally, thus reducing transportation costs.
Short lead times are another key factor for Zara. Where other fashion companies
supply every 3 months, Zara replenishes its stores twice a week. The company
provides the necessary fundamentals for subcontractors to meet their agreed upon
delivery times.
To implement its SC strategy, ZARA redesigned its inventory management.
Previously, goods were shipped from two central warehouses to each of the stores,
based on requests from individual store managers. These local decisions, when
assessed on a global scale, inevitably led to inefﬁcient warehousing, shipping, and
logistics operations. Production overruns, inefﬁcient SCs, and an ever-changing
marketplace (to say the least) were some of the problems which Zara had to
overcome.
A variety of SCOM models was used in redesigning and implementing an entirely
new inventory management system. The new centralized decision-making system
replaced all store-level inventory decisions, thus providing results that were more
globally optimal. Since implementation, having the right products in the right places
at the right time for customers led to increase in sales from 3% to 4%.
Inventory at Zara is kept a smidge under the estimated sales levels. For example,
if demand increases immensely for clutch purses, they can assign emergency orders.
In this way, the company is able to deal with sudden demand changes. However,
when the opposite is the case, Zara’s management determined that the potentially

4.1 Introductory Case-Study “Quick and Affordable”: Zara, UNIQLO & Primark

83

lost customers would be less costly than slow moving or last season’s products.
Speed is Zara’s key strategy. All products are to leave the warehouse after a
maximum of 3 days. At the end of each season, Zara reduces the price of its products
up to 30% to sell remaining stocks.
All items arrive at the stores ironed, on hangers, and with price tags, saving
valuable time for staff. Zara’s pricing is based not on the classical cost plus margin
principle, but on setting prices according to comparable items in the local market.
Because of this, it is possible that the same product has a different price in each
European country. To make price tagging easier, Zara previously attached a tag on
its goods showing all prices and goods could easily be shifted from one country to
another with reduced complexity. Today, bar codes are used to tag the products, and
these can be read via a scanner, showing the local price in the local store. This also
enables Zara to keep up-to-date information about when and where goods are sold.
All information is analyzed at headquarters so that particular strategies can be
adapted if necessary.
Marketing is minimized, as Zara sees all promotion activities as distracting for the
customer. The company has managed to present itself as a fashion retailer with everchanging and up-to-date styles with good quality at affordable price levels.
Customers value exactly these assets—making all additional marketing efforts
unnecessary.

4.1.2

UNIQLO: Basic, Casual Wear at Top Quality

UNIQLO does the exact opposite of Zara, but is no less successful. UNIQLO is one
of the largest and fastest growing Japanese companies and ranks third among fashion
retailers worldwide following Gap and Marks & Spencer. The mother company,
FAST RETAILING CO. LTD, which also owns brand names GU and Theory, was
founded in 1963 in Japan, where it still has its head ofﬁce in Yamaguchi-City. Highquality and affordable products are valued more highly than chasing the newest
trend.
Products are rather casual and basic, making them occasion- and age-less, but still
stylish, using various colors and cuts. As a result, UNIQLO meets customer demand
for clothes without presenting them on the catwalk.
UNIQLO has multiple production and purchasing ofﬁces in Asia which look after
more than 100 suppliers each week. By doing this, the company is able to maintain
good quality control over their outsourced partners. If issues concerning quality
arise, they are immediately taken to the production units where means for
improvements are found. Currently, UNIQLO is seeking to expand their purchasing
and production facilities to meet demand in the United Kingdom and the United
States.
UNIQLO controls its inventory carefully to maintain optimum inventory levels
for each week. At the end of each season, products are sold for 20–30% less than the
initial price to get rid of inventory.

84

Operations and Supply Chain Strategy

Additionally, the fashion retailer has found a new place for selling clothes:
railway stations. The concept works fabulously for UNIQLO. Shinjuku Station is
Tokyo’s biggest rail station and the UNIQLO store there ranks 6th out of
770 UNIQLO stores. Popularity of so-called one-day packs with basics like socks
and underwear has also risen.
UNIQLO follows the SPA model (specialty store retailer of private label apparel)
which is a specialized model where fashion retailers track all business activities from
the point of origin up to the point of sale. This approach enables UNIQLO to
improve its business processes quickly and constantly, giving the company an
advantage over its competitors. Through long-term relationships with suppliers,
UNIQLO is always seeking ways to improve its SC. This affects selling prices. By
optimizing its SC, the company has been able to lower prices up to one third
compared to its competitors.
UNIQLO promotes its products on posters, ﬂyers, or TV, hinting which items
will be put out for sales the following week.

4.1.3

Primark: It’s All About Money

A lot for a little is what customers value when visiting Primark stores, leaving with
huge bags full of new fashionable clothes which cost not even half of what
competitors offer. Primark belongs to Associated British Foods, a company selling
food and clothes. Since the ﬁrst store opened in Dublin, Primark has quickly
expanded and today has more than 250 stores all over Europe. In the future, the
company plans to open even more stores in more countries.
The product is based on simple designs with fashionable prints. To save costs
Primark focuses on selling only the most popular sizes.
Primark’s customers demand catwalk fashion items at supermarket price levels.
That’s why it is all about money for Primark. Primark’s products are sourced from
more than 600 suppliers, mainly from low-cost countries. Buying and selling in high
volumes and using economies of scale allows Primark to cut down selling prices for
the customer. The company uses the off-season to produce in advance and uses
cheaper production periods. Primark uses a typical and efﬁcient make-to-stock
strategy where the focus is to (guess what?) cut costs.
In addition, Primark has little mark-up on their products and avoids marketing
efforts, as it trusts to mouth-to-mouth advertising. As a result, prices are
comparatively low.
Criticism has risen concerning the sustainability of low-cost retailers, as many
workers in low-cost countries suffer poor working conditions. This has also caught
the attention of some customers, which is why retailers such as Primark try to
counter a negative ethical image, e.g., bus disclosing their suppliers.

4.2

Operations and Supply Chain Strategies

4.2.1

Value Added and Costs

Value added and costs are two basic, dominant factors in SCOM. Value creation can
be achieved in different ways, e.g., through innovation, unique service, or quality.
Any process has value-added steps, but these require resources which increase the
costs. Of course, good processes have to be designed with a high degree of valueadding time and short periods of non-value added time. This increases both effectiveness and efﬁciency.
However, in practice the opposite situation often occurs. In many cases, the
value-added steps hardly comprise more than 20% of the total time, and more
realistically estimations are about 5–7% (Vrijhoef and Koskela 2000; Christopher
2011). This relation between value-added time and costs can be depicted as shown in
Fig. 4.1.

Fig. 4.1 Value-added and costs

86

4

Operations and Supply Chain Strategy

It can be observed from the car manufacturing example above that value-added
time is short compared to the increase in costs. The general recommendation is
therefore to condense the cost creation steps to reduce the lead-time and increase the
service level. A nice illustration of this idea is the following: a doctor has to remove a
tick, and the act itself takes only 10 s, but the patient will spend at least 10 min in the
room since 9 min and 50 s will be required to ﬁll in the numerous forms and medical
insurance documents. In this case, the value-added time is only 1.7%.

4.2.2

Operations Strategies

Since different ways exist to create value and reduce costs, different operations
strategies can be classiﬁed as follows:
•
•
•
•

Innovation strategy
Efﬁciency strategy
Quality strategy
Service strategy

The main driver in innovation strategy is great product or service innovation.
Creating value through unique product or service properties may signiﬁcantly
increase a company’s margins while maintaining cost efﬁciencies. An example of
this is Apple, and its transition from the iPhone3 to the iPhone4. While the
manufacturing costs were only slightly increased, the price was almost doubled.
SCM with an innovation strategy should enable fast and smooth introductions of
new products and sales increases.
In an efﬁciency strategy, price is the main competitive advantage. IKEA is well
known for its highly efﬁcient logistics and manufacturing. All the steps in the value
chain support the efﬁciency strategy. Starting with consideration of manufacturing
and logistics at the product design stage, the operations at IKEA follow this
philosophy in all other areas such as production, sourcing, and shipments (Heizer
and Render 2013).
A quality strategy ensures a competitive advantage based on superior product
properties. “Made in Germany” has been associated with high quality standards for
many years. For such products, costs may be higher since in all operational areas
decisions are taken in favor of quality. Quality control mechanisms are crucial for
ensuring high quality in the SCs.
A service or responsiveness strategy means a high priority for customer
preferences in operations decisions. Zara is known for its highly responsive
operations and SCs. This is possible through sophisticated facility location planning
and production in small batches. Both create additional costs, but these are covered
by higher value-added activities (Chopra and Meindl 2015).

4.2 Operations and Supply Chain Strategies

87

Supply Chain Strategies and “Strategic Fit”

4.2.3

A SC strategy should correspond to the competitive and operations strategies.
Matching enterprise competitive strategy and SC strategy is called “strategic ﬁt”
(Chopra and Meindl 2015). Strategic ﬁt presumes the alignment of objectives in
different departments with the overall SC objectives. For example, typical decisions
in marketing relate to product mix and pricing. This should be brought into correspondence with logistics decisions such as transportation, packaging, and
transshipment.

Practical Insights

Consider an example. Walmart has a marketplace strategy that mainly
focuses on the high availability of a variety of reasonable quality products
at a lower pricing level. Its products are not differentiated by technological advancement or unique design elements and can be purchased at
other retailers as well. The competitive strength of Walmart lies in high
availability and low prices which Walmart’s customers consequently
expect from the mega retailer. In order to be in line with the marketing
focus introduced, Walmart has adapted its SC appropriately. For example,
Walmart has its own SC infrastructure and all distribution networks are
fully owned. In addition, they buy from low-cost producers only. This SC
strategy fully supports Walmart’s business focus of providing low prices
and an everyday guarantee for product availability. Thus, Walmart
represents a successful example of strategic fit (Chopra and Meindl 2015).

SC strategies and SC contributions to competitive and operations strategies are
shown in Table 4.1. A SC strategy does not often target only one factor. Only
decreasing prices to the lowest level may be an option. At the same time, a SC
strategy needs to be matched to company and customer requirements. Consider in
detail efﬁcient and responsive SC strategies (see Table 4.2). Characteristics of agile
SCs are a fast response to customer demand, low inventory, and ﬂexible suppliers.
Also, lead times are reduced to enable a swift reaction to demand ﬂuctuations.
Margins are comparatively high to suitably fulﬁll the company’s ﬁnancial needs.

Responsive SCs are best ﬁt where market requirements are unpredictable and
changeable.
When looking at lean SCs, almost always the opposite is the case. The market
situation is stable in demand and price. The variety of products is also comparatively
low. Efﬁcient SCs concentrate mainly on lowering costs via high capacity utilization, minimizing inventory, and contracting suppliers from low cost countries.
Accordingly, margins are kept at a low level. Lean SC strategies also try to reduce
lead time, but not at the expense of higher costs.
While choosing a strategy, it is sometimes advisable to go for a mixed approach.
A poor strategy might endanger the company, perhaps by its not positioning itself
prominently enough in the market, with the additional risk of encountering other
negative factors. Some situations require a clear position in the lean or agile
SC. However, many companies have a wide product range. For some products,
market conditions may be stable; for others, however, they may be volatile and
unpredictable. For these companies, a hybrid strategy of applying elements of
responsiveness and efﬁciency for their particular products is advisable.
As a part of SC strategy, the deﬁnition of pre-assembled components, modules, or
systems is paramount. These modules or systems should be pre-tested and should be
ready to install shipped directly from the supplier to the point of usage on the shop
ﬂoor of the producer. Furthermore, early cooperation between the supplier of the
modules and its customer will also help to increase the usage of standard parts in
higher volumes, which will also result in reduced costs due to economies of scale.

case study reviews the main initiatives and the results of a SC optimization project
which took place in one of the world’s leading nutrition companies for babies and
children in Latin America. The underlying company merchandises more than
70 products in over 50 countries. The objective of the SC optimization was to
increase SC agility by synchronizing all the processes involved in order to reduce
the overall lead time. Every process was redesigned to deliver only what was needed
by the next process, and only when the next process needed it.
An agile SC can be deﬁned as a “network of different companies, possessing
complementary skills and integrated with streamlined material, information and
ﬁnancial ﬂow, focusing on ﬂexibility and performance” (Costantino et al. 2012);
this was also the focus of the initiatives that were implemented in this case study.
The project was implemented in the Latin American division which has its
headquarters, production site, and distribution centers in Mexico, and its distributors
in eight countries in Latin America. The project was divided into four phases (see
Fig. 4.2).
The ﬁrst phase describes the Analysis, where the company’s current SC situation
was analyzed and deﬁned. The second phase, the New System Design, had as its
objective the strategic development of new processes to enable SC agility. The third
phase, the Pilot Implementation, applied the new processes on a representative
product family. The last phase, the Roll Out, embraces the total implementation of
all products and markets.
In the analysis phase, the total lead time (the time from supplier until sale to ﬁnal
customer) was mapped. It indicated 188 days for Mexico and 295 days to export to
Latin America (which is the average for all countries). The fairly long lead time was
mainly caused by high inventory levels and large production batch sizes. At the same
time, ﬁll rates at the retail stores indicated less than 90%, and shelf life varied from
0 (out of stock) to 139 days, mainly caused by poor forecast accuracy and replenishment strategies. Hence, the main obstacles faced at the beginning of the project were
high inventory levels, long response, and lead times, all caused mainly by large batch
sizes produced at production facilities. The overall number of products was pushed
downstream through the distribution channels without alignment with real demand.
The distributors, keeping high inventory levels, were also used to push the products
to their respective markets. Further downstream, the retailers offered discounts and
ran promotions in order to move the inventories pushed on from the distribution
channel, generating pressure on sales margins. The pressure on margins is subsequently passed on upstream, since volume discounts usually result in lower margins
for distributors and manufacturers (see Fig. 4.3).

After a detailed analysis of the information and material ﬂows, the future vision
and implementation plan were detailed at the second phase of the project: New
System Design Phase. The design for installing new processes included synchronization tools for all processes for all points of the SC in order to align production,
consumption, and material movements (see Fig. 4.4).
The current information systems also needed to be redesigned in order to handle
the new process structures. A very important point was the deﬁnition of scheduling
methodologies and the deﬁnition of production and transportation lot sizes.

4.3 Supply Chain Coordination

91

At the roll-out phase, the implemented processes needed to be stabilized for all
products, markets, suppliers, and customers. As a result, it became possible to
decrease lead time by 80% from supplier to local consumers and by 55% from
supplier to export markets.
During the pilot implementation, a production plan with a higher “production
frequency” and smaller lot sizes was implemented for one production family.
Synchronization processes and systems were introduced for the main suppliers and
customers. For this product family, 72% of inventory reduction was achieved.
Introducing an “agile SC” concept allowed a reduction in inventory shortages,
and decreased lead time, while at the same time reducing inventory levels throughout
the entire SC. In the underlying project case, this was achieved by using transparent
point-of-sale (POS) data as input, which reﬂects real customer demand. Consequently, customers ﬁnd a fresher product, when they need it and where they want
it, thus increasing sales, turnover, and revenue all along the SC. The real
end-customer demand combined with higher production frequencies allows the
adjustment of correct size inventory levels for all points in the SC, be it local or
global. Adequate inventory levels and higher production frequency not only reduce
lead times, but also allow for a faster response to consumer demand. Hence,
replenishments are managed on lower volumes, but with higher frequency.
Implementing agile systems brought various advantages to the SC. Since production responds to real demand, the company is less likely to build up
unnecessary inventories, thus freeing up cash, and reducing working capital as
well as costs for expensive warehouses, distribution centers, and obsolete products.
Sales on the retailers’ side also increased as service levels were improved and fresher
products were replenished more frequently to ﬁll the shelves to an adequate inventory level.

Bullwhip Effect

The bullwhip effect is not a new phenomenon in the industrial world (Forrester
1961). The effect can be explained as the magniﬁcation of variability in orders in the
SC. In other words, irregular orders in the downstream part of the SC become more
distinct upstream in the SC. This variance can interrupt the smoothness of SC
processes as each link in the SC will over- or under-estimate product demand,
resulting in exaggerated ﬂuctuations (see Fig. 4.5).
Many retailers, each with little variability in their orders, can cause great
variability for a smaller number of wholesalers, and even greater variability for a
single manufacturer. The main reasons for the bullwhip effect can be divided into
behavioral and operational areas (Lee et al. 1997; Sterman 2000):

(Table 4.3).
Consider how demand non-transparency leads to the bullwhip-effect.
"

Practical Insights

In order to reduce bullwhip-effect, it is recommended to avoid panic
ordering reactions in the event of unexpected demand fluctuations. It is
advisable to take into account time lags between orders and deliveries
throughout the SC. It is important to understand where the demand is,
where the inventory is, and where the costs are.

Task 4.1 Bullwhip Effect: Focus on Demand Non-transparency
A fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) company is facing slight demand variation
which has led to huge variations in stocks on the supplier side. The company delivers
its product to consumers through the manufacturer and three suppliers. Because of
the relatively low cost of changing the production rate compared to the cost of
carrying inventory, the company has decided to change its production rate in order to
reduce the capital commitment in the form of ﬁnished product. The task shows the
effect on the manufacturer of a 10% decrease in demand from customers.
New order=production rate ¼ Demand new  Safety stock old
þ Safety stock new

ð4:1Þ

The initial data for analysis is presented in Table 4.4.
Now, demand has decreased by 10%. Safety stock is 25% of demand and is
therefore able to cover demand of 1 week. New demand correlates with the new
production rate of the predecessor SC member (see Fig. 4.6).

Fig. 4.6 Implications of the demand ﬂuctuations on production rates

Each player in the SC assumes that demand forecast (or orders) for the next period
is the same as in the current period. Following this assumption, each supplier will be
the same as in the current period, and each supplier will be planning their production
rate to cover the demand/order for the next period, which will be equal to the
demand/order for the current period (e.g., the new demand of supplier #3 orients
itself by the new production rate of supplier #2). The problem is that only the
manufacturer can see the changes in demand on the customer side. Other players
in the SC cannot see the changes in demand because of non-transparency. For that
reason, the players will change their production rate and safety stocks because the
predecessor changed his order without pre-informing other SC partners.
We can observe that a lack of demand transparency affects the shortage. For
example, supplier #3 will not produce the right amount of pieces for customers’
orders to satisfy their demand.
It can be concluded that changes on the customer side increase order quantity
through the SC if demand is non-transparent. In general, communication, validation
of demand, information sharing, computer aided ordering, and better pricing
strategies can help reduce the bull-whip effect in this situation.

Vendor-Managed Inventory

Inventory typically exists to manage uncertainty of supply and demand (safety stock)
and to take advantage of economy of scale (cycle inventory). At the same time,
modern markets require more ﬂexibility from SCs. Customer orders and demand
change frequently. In building up high inventory, companies can increase their
ﬂexibility on the one hand. On the other hand, if demand changes, these inventory
mountains will lead to losses. Consider a short example: HP and Canon worked
jointly on the Laserjet printer production. Canon produced engines for different
types of printers. However, HP was able to indicate changes in demand only
3 months in advance. Canon needed 6 months to change its production plans. As
demand for Laserjet III drastically decreased, a huge number of engines for this
printer type was in inventory and had to be written off (the Laserjet-mountain).
In order to face this challenge, SC coordination strategies extensively use the
Internet and new IT. The ideas of these concepts are as follows (Heizer and Render
2013):
•
•
•
•

Coordination instead of uncertainty
“Replace inventory with information”
Integrated SC
Transparency of demand and inventory.

At the plant level, inventory is insurance against the unknown; in the SC, this
“unknown” became “known” through collaboration. Inventories in SCM are leverage for SC reliability and ﬂexibility rather than buffers against a blind uncertainty.
One of the strategies for SC coordination is vendor-managed inventory (VMI).
With VMI, the vendor controls inventory on the buyer side. The buyer provides
information on inventory and sales (see Fig. 4.7).

Fig. 4.7 Vendor-managed inventory strategy

96

4

Operations and Supply Chain Strategy

VMI is a special concept of restocking and replenishing inventory that originated
in retail business, the line of business where stock availability is a signiﬁcant if not a
crucial factor of company’s success. The buyer provides certain information to a
supplier, and the supplier takes full responsibility for maintaining an agreed upon
inventory level, usually at the buyer’s consumption location (usually a store). A third
party logistics provider (3PL) might be involved to control the required level of
inventory by adjusting the demand and supply gaps.
The main advantage of this concept is that the real-time inventory information is
made available to the supplier (manufacturer of a wholesaler) and a customer
(distributor or retailer) relinquishes control of inventory to them. The vendor reviews
every item that a customer carries and is responsible for the inventory plan. Efﬁciency increases in process activities are based on Electronic Data Interchange (EDI)
and collaborative SC organization (see Fig. 4.8).
The supplier receives an insight into stock level and demand forecast and ensures
that the stock is within agreed upon limits. Consider an example of the VMI process
in SupplyOn (Fig. 4.9).
The following steps are included in the VMI process at SupplyOn (Fig. 4.9):
• agree upon minimum and maximum stock limits;
• demand and inventory is transmitted from the internal ERP system to SupplyOn;
• demand and inventory is shown in the Inventory Monitor, thus the supplier can
plan deliveries based on the agreed limits;
• ASN (Advanced Shipment Notiﬁcation) is entered by the supplier and transmitted
to the internal ERP system;
• while the goods are being dispatched, the Inventor Monitor shows them as
in-transit quantities;

• goods are booked into the system upon delivery and become visible in the Stock
Monitor;
• an invoice or credit note is generated as soon as the goods have been booked.
Advantages of VMI are as follows:
For the Vendor
•
•
•
•
•
•

Early recognition of ﬂuctuation in demand
Optimization of production planning; increased volume
Enforcement of discipline: measurements and communication
Better planning and resource use via visibility
Improved market analysis and elimination of non-value-added activities
Closer customer ties and preferred status

For the Buyer
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

Increase of inventory availability
Reduction of procurement activities
Fewer stock-outs with higher inventory turnover
Optimal product mix
Lower operating, purchasing, and administrative costs
SC relationship strategic strength
Greater customer satisfaction and increased sales

Operations and Supply Chain Strategy

For End-User
• Increased service level and reduced stock outs
However, it is proven that a sustainable VMI requires trust from both parties and
willingness to invest (e.g. switching costs, EDI, etc.). A closer relationship implies
more interdependency and cooperation. So, a customer needs to be ready to communicate promotions and other marketing campaigns with the supplier so that
additional items can be available on time. Among other limitations of VMI are
unforeseeable risks, as employee strikes in the event of stock outs and the risk of
customer loss.
The limitations of VMI can be stated as follows:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

Trust in the SC should be high;
High costs of implementation and investments in IT; dependence on EDI;
Customer loss risk;
Non-foreseeable risks: employee strikes;
VMI mostly beneﬁts end user and seller while vendor does most of the work;
Additional processing activities for vendor (costs);
Supplier dependent buyer.
The VMI concept has been proven to be efﬁcient in the following cases:

• Items with high a consumption amount;
• Items with a high consumption value (compare with ABC analysis);
• Traditional procurement activities should be changed.
Lastly, VMI is suggested for the lines of business with multiple outlets and with
the potential for long-term partnerships between vendor and customer. Simply put, a
major retail store chain is more likely to beneﬁt from the VMI and recover the capital
invested in switching to VMI than a small family-owned convenient store. VMI is
recommended speciﬁcally for industries like retail, pharmaceutical, automotive,
high-tech, and other industries where inventory expectation is a signiﬁcant factor
in gaining competitive advantage.

4.3.3

Collaborative Planning, Forecasting and Replenishment

Collaborative Planning, Forecasting, and Replenishment (CPFR) aims to integrate
and coordinate actors and processes in the SC regarding the planning and fulﬁllment
of customer demand, production, and inventory (see Fig. 4.10). CPFR is the
cooperative management of demand and supply through joint visibility and replenishment of products in the SC. CPFR is based on information exchange between
suppliers and retailers, which helps in planning and satisfying customer demands
through a joint system of shared information. CPFR includes three basic stages:

Planning
Front-end agreement
Joint-business plan

Forecasting
Sales-forecast
collaboration
Order-forecast

Replenishment
Order generation

In the planning phase, the deﬁnition of collaboration areas, responsibilities, and a
description of the collaboration mission, objectives, and framework takes place.
Trading partners share the business plans and organizational information. Category
information, such as deﬁnition of roles, strategies, and tactics, needs to be explored.
Seasonal events and frameworks for all events should be shared at this stage.
In the forecasting phase, sales and order forecasts need to be performed and
shared. Moreover, exceptions for these forecasts should be classiﬁed. Events, promotion plans for products, new product information, individual forecast, and forecast constraints related to the sales should be shared.
In the replenishment area, lead time, logistics data, location changes, current
inventory levels, inventory in transit, and POS (point-of-sale) data should be shared.
In the last phase, a committed order from order forecasts should be generated.

4.3.4

Supply Chain Contracting

A supply contract speciﬁes parameters governing the buyer-supplier relationship
(Chopra and Meindl 2012). Contracts have a signiﬁcant impact on the behavior and
performance of all stages in an SC. Two groups of contracts can be distinguished:
• Contracts for product availability and SC proﬁt and
• Contracts to coordinate SC costs.
In the ﬁrst group, the supplier designs a contract that encourages the buyer to
purchase more items and increase the level of product availability. In other words,

100

4

Operations and Supply Chain Strategy

the supplier shares a part of the buyer’s demand uncertainty. In this group, the
following contracts are included:
• Buyback or returns contracts (a salvage price is used at which a retailer can return
unsold inventory for a certain amount)
• Revenue-sharing contracts (a share of the retailer’s revenue is paid to the supplier)
• Quantity ﬂexibility contracts (the manufacturer allows the retailer to change the
quantity ordered after observing demand).
Contracts to coordinate SC costs are based on quantity discount contracts. A quantity
discount contract decreases overall costs but leads by tendency to higher lot sizes. This
in turn facilitates higher levels of inventory in the SC. It is typically reasonable for
commodity products for which the supplier has high ﬁxed costs per lot. We refer to the
textbook by Das (2016) regarding quantitative analysis of the SC contracts.

4.4

Supply Chain Resilience and Sustainability

SCs inﬂuence the environment and are inﬂuenced by it. In light of ecological
problems, natural disasters, and society development challenges, the necessity for
new viewpoints on SCM has become even more obvious. The former paradigm of
overall and unlimited customer satisfaction has naturally failed because of the
limited resources available for this satisfaction.
In these settings, the duality of the main goals of SCM—maximizing service level
and minimizing costs—will be enhanced by the third component—maintaining SC
resilience and sustainability (Ivanov 2017). This “triangle” goal framework will
build the new SCM paradigm that can be formulated as the maintenance of resilience
and the harmonization of value chains with possibly full customer satisfaction and
cost-efﬁcient resource consumption to ensure the performance of productionecological systems at an inﬁnite time horizon (see Fig. 4.11).

Supply Chain Sustainability: Examples of Coca-Cola
and Mercadona

SC sustainability is based on a triple-bottom-line: “economy-ecology-society”. Joint
consideration of all these elements is crucial for SCM in the long-term perspective.
In SCM such concepts as “Closed-Loop Supply Chain” and “Reverse Logistics”
have been developed. They are based on the idea that a SC does not end at the point
of sale, but can include the after-sale area. We highlight SC sustainability issues
based on two case-studies of Coca-Cola and Mercadona.
Case Study Coca-Cola
The Coca-Cola system created a value chain based on strong partnerships with
suppliers, distributors, and retailers. The Coca-Cola Company itself only
manufactures the bases of the beverages, such as syrups and concentrates. It then
distributes and sells these to their bottling partners (over 250 worldwide), located in
every country where the products of Coca-Cola are sold (see Fig. 4.12).
The bottling partners manufacture packages and distribute the drinks as branded
beverages to the points of sales (POS). The bottling partners also organize collaboration with suppliers. For example, Coca-Cola Beverages Vienna has had a longterm collaboration with SIG, a leading supplier of liquid packaging materials.

Fig. 4.12 Coca-Cola supply chain

102

4

Operations and Supply Chain Strategy

Coca-Cola and SIG have recognized and embraced CPFR (collaborative planning,
forecasting and replenishment). SIG has electronic access to inventory levels and
sales forecasts at Coca-Cola with no time delay (it was previously up to 15 days
late). Coca-Cola receives exact delivery quantities and times. This has enabled
Coca-Cola to reduce inventory levels for packaging material by 50%. This drastically reduces the processing time for orders and increases customer lock-in.
The bottling partners stay in close contact with grocery stores, supermarkets,
convenience stores, cinemas and all other customers providing drinks from CocaCola. After selling the beverages to customers, consumers are able to buy all CocaCola products from the different POS. Because every empty Coca-Cola bottle is
recyclable it is up to consumers to take responsibility for recycling.
The whole value chain is based on the fact that the company and its suppliers
don’t go through a process from manufacturing to distributing the products to the
consumer, but consider a closed loop, from manufacturing to using, and recovering
material again for manufacturing. On the one hand, this minimizes productions costs
and, on the other hand, helps protect the environment. For instance, Coca-Cola
contributed $2.0B (USD) to the planting of 25,000 acres of orange groves, thereby
creating approximately 4100 jobs.
Because water is essential to the health of communities and communities are built
by the people who buy drinks from Coca-Cola, the company has to ﬁnd a way to
replenish their water. To provide access to clean water and therefore create sustainable water provision for communities and, of course, the production of beverages,
Coca-Cola contributed $18.4M (USD) in 2012 to support 58 water initiatives
worldwide.
In addition, supporting different projects on recycling and recovering used
material and the development of new technologies plays a crucial role in making
the packaging process more sustainable. In 2009, the Coca-Cola system developed
Plant Bottle packaging, a polyethylene terephthalate (PET) plastic bottle made
partially from plants and that is completely recyclable.
Regarding new technologies and ecological concerns, Coca-Cola also introduced
many projects to address climate change. Coca-Cola powers their trucks with a mix
of efﬁcient alternative fuels, for instance biodiesel or natural gas. In North America,
more than 750 trucks distributing products from Coca-Cola use about 30% less fuel
than they would with conventional diesel.
Case-Study Mercadona
The objective of this case study is to analyze how a company can efﬁciently
implement a sustainable SC without having a negative impact on turnover. Coordination of the value chain from positions of intermodal logistics and a closed-loop SC
makes it possible to decrease costs, improve on-time delivery and company image,
and achieve higher customer satisfaction. All these factors have a positive effect on
turnover.
Mercadona is a family business founded in Valencia and is the largest Spanish
supermarket chain in terms of a turnover of 19.08 million euros in 2012. In 1981, the

4.4 Supply Chain Resilience and Sustainability

103

company had only eight shops in Valencia. Today this has risen to the considerable
count of 1411 stores and 74,000 employees.
Mercadona is called the “Toyota of retail” because of its continuous improvement
of lean processes. For example, the company packs fruit loosely instead of selling it
in containers to save packaging material, sells only a limited number of goods, so it
can reduce cost due to the decreased variability, and has redesigned packaging to
optimize transportation. Mercadona says proﬁt is not the primary goal, but rather
investment in the long-term development of, for example, their employees. Being
lean and always one step ahead of their competitors is a part of Mercadona’s
strategy. The whole SC supports this strategy of leanness and innovation to remain
both efﬁcient and effective in modern volatile markets. The target of recent years
was to ﬁnd a way to generally become more sustainable. The Mercadona Board of
Management focused particularly on its SC.
Mercadona initially organized the transportation of its products by trucks and
collaborated with the logistics company Acotral, which increasingly suffered delays
due to road trafﬁc. Since many goods go from the supplier in Sevilla in south Spain
to Valencia in the east, usage of rail services for the longest part of the distance was
discussed as an option.
Renfe, a former state-owned train company, was suffering immensely from
market liberalization. To secure their ﬁnancial position they were seeking a new
strategy. Offering transporting solutions to supermarket chains became an attractive
option.
Hence, Mercadona, Arcotral and Renfe arrived at a collaborative agreement to
involve rail as a transportation mode. The new intermodal logistics process was
designed as follows. From the supplier in Seville the products were transported by
truck to the rail terminal in Seville. Here the goods were transhipped, with Renfe
taking the goods on two trains twice a week to Valencia. Of course, this concept only
worked for non-fresh goods such as sugar and non-food goods such as batteries.
From the Valencia rail terminal, Arcotral picked up the goods and brought them to
Mercadona’s distribution center to supply the regional supermarkets.
The crucial element of the redesigned SC was coordination between the
companies. Renfe had to customize its services to be able to transport such a large
amount of goods to Mercadona. Moreover, collaborative agreements can be successful only if based on trust and a win-win situation for all. As previously stated,
Renfe customized their services. Further changes on their side included a communication tool which enabled the tracking of the product at each stage of the transportation process. Mercadona then incorporated this communication tool into its own
system which made it possible to have visibility throughout the whole SC. By
offering this transportation solution, Renfe developed a new business concept.
With such key customers as Mercadona, they resolved their own ﬁnancial situation
and secured a market position. In its turn, Mercadona became less vulnerable to road
trafﬁc, and deliveries were rarely delayed. This also saved costs in terms of
maintaining safety stocks. While using rail, there were less noise emissions, fewer
trafﬁc jams and accidents, 12,000 tons less of CO2 emissions each year. Mercadona
demonstrated a best-practice example of how a company can, when implementing it

correctly, increase sustainability and have positive effects on their business processes and turnover
Discussion Questions
• The case study shows positive, real-life examples which can be applied to other
businesses. Even though Mercadona is a ﬁrst-class example of how to implement
sustainability in SCM, where can you see possible limitations of this concept?
• Consider the new SC redesigned within the collaborative agreement between
Mercadona, Renfe, and Arcotral. At which point could a reverse ﬂow/closed-loop
SC be implemented?
• As stated in the case study, collaborative agreements only work based on “trust
and a win-win situation for all.” What challenges can you see which could
become critical for the SC?

4.4.2

Supply Chain Resilience and Ripple Effect

This sub-section brieﬂy introduces the SC risk area. In Chap. 16, we will elaborate
on different espects of SC risks, resilience, and ripple effect. In general, SC risks can
be classiﬁed into the areas of demand, supply, process, and structure (see Fig. 4.13).
Risks of demand and supply uncertainty are related to random uncertainty and a
business-as-usual situation. Such risks are also known as recurrent or operational
risks. SC managers achieved signiﬁcant improvements in managing global SCs and
mitigating recurrent SC risks through improved planning and execution (Chopra and
Sodhi 2014). From 2010 to 2014, SC disruptions occurred at a greater frequency and
intensity, and thus had greater consequences. Such disruptive risks now represent a
new challenge for SC managers (Simchi-Levi et al. 2015; Ivanov et al. 2017a, b). Let
us concentrate on the disruption side.
First, globalization and outsourcing trends make SCs more complex and less
observable and controllable. According to complexity theory, such systems become
more sensitive to disruptions. Special focus in this area is directed towards
disruptions in transportation channels. Second, the efﬁciency paradigms of lean

4.4 Supply Chain Resilience and Sustainability

Fig. 4.14 Supply chain resilience (Ivanov et al. 2014a)

processes, single sourcing, etc. have failed in disruption situations. As a consequence, SCs have become more vulnerable, even to minor perturbations. Any
disruption in a global SC, especially in its supply base, immediately affects the
entire SC. Third, with increased specialization and geographical concentration of
manufacturing, disruptions in one or several nodes affect almost all nodes and links
in the SC. Fourth, IT became the crucial element of global SCs, since disruptions in
IT may have signiﬁcant impact on disruptions in material ﬂows.
Resilience is the ability to maintain, execute, and recover (adapt) planned execution along with achievement of the planned (or adapted, but yet still acceptable)
performance (Ivanov and Sokolov 2013). Building a resilient SC is based on
mitigating risks, preparedness for disruptions, stabilization, and recovery (see
Fig. 4.14).
Basic areas of resilience include system, process, and product resilience. To the
basic elements of increasing SC resilience belong the following (Blackhurst et al.
2011; Pettit et al. 2013; Chopra and Sodhi 2014):
•
•
•
•
•
•

Back-up suppliers
Excessive inventory
Excessive capacity
Information coordination and data transparency
Process ﬂexibility
Product ﬂexibility.

Coordination and sourcing strategies in the SC are also typical in practice. Many
companies also invest in structural redundancy (e.g., Toyota extends its SC subject
to multiple-sourcing and building new facilities on the supply side). All these four
elements of resilience can be seen as strategies for mitigating at the pre-disruption
stage and reacting at the post-disruption stage in the resilience framework.
For practical implementation, it is important to understand that risk and resilience
analysis means little unless they are brought into correspondence with their impact
on cost efﬁciency. The trade-off “efﬁciency-ﬂexibility-resilience” becomes more

106

and more important in SCOM and has been recently considered as ripple-effect in
SCs (Ivanov et al. 2014a, b).
While the bullwhip effect describes high-probability-low-impact risks, ripple
effect focuses on low-frequency-high-impact disruptions. Ripple effect in the SC
results from disruption propagation of an initial disruption towards other SC stages
in the supply, production, and distribution networks (Fig. 4.15).
Ripple effect is not an infrequent occurrence. In many cases, SC disruptions go
beyond the disrupted stage; i.e., the original disruption causes disruption propagation in the SC, at times provoking still higher consequences. Ripple effect is a
phenomenon of disruption propagations in the SC and their impact on output SC
performance (e.g., sales, on-time delivery, and total proﬁt). Ripple effect may have
more serious consequences than short-term performance decreases. It can result in
market share losses (e.g., Toyota lost its market leader position after the tsunami in
2011 and needed to redesign its SC coordination mechanism or lose company value.
Hendricks and Singhal (2005) quantiﬁed the negative effects of SC disruption
through empirical analysis and found 33–40% lower stock returns relative to their
benchmarks over a 3 year time period that started 1 year before and ended 2 years
after a disruption: large negative effects on proﬁtability, a 107% drop in operating
income, 7% lower sales growth and an 11% growth in costs, 2 years with a lower
performance level after a disruption.
Ripple effect is also known as the “domino effect” or “snowball effect”. The
reasons for ripple effect are not difﬁcult to identify. With increasing SC complexity
and consequent pressure on increasing speed and efﬁciency, ever larger numbers of
industries come to be distributed worldwide and concentrated in jowl industrial
districts. In addition, globalized SCs depend heavily on permanent transportation

At the same time, a capacity

Without a coordinated contingency
policy, disruption recovery and

very long lasting and expensive.
Coordinated control algorithms are
needed to monitor SC behavior,

considered in the SC resilience framework (Fig. 4.14).
Table 4.5 summarizes the reasons and counter-measures for ripple effect (Ivanov
and Rozhkov 2017; Dolgui et al. 2018; Ivanov 2018).
Literature provides evidence that disruption duration and propagation impact SC
performance. Proactive strategies such as backup facilities and inventory have
positive impacts concerning both performance and prevention of disruption propagation. Speed of recovery plays an important role in mitigating the performance
impact of disruptions. An increase in SC resilience may imply cost increases in
the SC.

4.5

Key Points

A SC strategy is one of the most important strategies in an enterprise. It should
correspond to competitive and operations strategy. Such an alignment is called
“strategic ﬁt”. SC strategies can be based on costs, agility, innovation, or quality.
Frequently, hybrid strategies are very successful.
One of the crucial issues in SCM is SC coordination. Failed coordination in the
SC can lead to the bullwhip effect. It can be prevented with the help of information
coordination, sharing data about sales, demand forecasts, and inventory. VMI and
CPFR are examples of coordination strategies. Sophisticated SC contracting can also
help to ensure better SC coordination.
Finally, sustainability and resilience have become more and more important in
SCM. The bottom-line “economy-ecology-society” has direct impact on the future

108

development of SCM. Resilient SCs are expected to continue their execution even if
severe disruptions occur and parts of the SC are destroyed.

Introductory Case Study “New Logistics Concept (NLK: Das
Neue Logistik Konzept) at Volkswagen”

In 2011, new goals for 2018 for the Volkswagen Group were announced: 20% cost
reduction; 50% fewer complaints about defects in new vehicles; 30 great
innovations; higher employee satisfaction; perfectly trained workers; only 8 weeks
between start and full operation of serial production—and all of this with 25% less
environmental damage. These seven commandments have to be carried on an
aluminum card by each VW production manager.

5 Sourcing Strategy

The new Volkswagen production system (VPS) and the new logistics concept
(NLK) at Volkswagen (VW)
Despite many achievements, the Volkswagen Group also faces many challenges
concerning productivity, which is mainly inﬂuenced by production and logistics.
While its biggest competitor, Toyota, produces on average 30 vehicles per employee
each year, at VW this number is only 17.
Other challenges are: different production processes at globally distributed VW
locations; demand variations and missing ﬂexibility in production and logistics;
larger stocks as a consequence of separated production and logistics planning; and
the continuous development of new technologies (e.g., hybrid and electrical
vehicles).
Toyota’s success can be traced back to lean production. Just-in-time (JIT) (no on-stock production and logistics), Kaizen (continuous improvement) and Jidoka
(avoiding errors through intelligent automation) are the three pillars of lean production. The new Volkswagen production systems (VPS) and the new logistics concept
(NLK) should improve production and logistics performance.
Through the new VPS-System, costs per vehicle should decrease by about 1500
€. This should be achieved through:
• introduction of ﬂexible assembly lines, producing various models (e.g. the new
VW plant in China can produce two different Golf models, as well as two
different Audi models on the same assembly line);
• standardization of production processes (e.g. one painting procedure for all
90 plants instead of 90 different ones as is now the case);
• reduction in the number of variations (e.g. only 28 variations of air-conditioning
instead of 102 as is now the case).
The VW Group follows an ambitious strategy with VPS and is facing big
challenges ahead. In the future, more models of different brands need to be produced
in one factory to be able to react more ﬂexibly. VW is, as of now in its factories in
emerging markets, building models of Skoda, Audi, and Volkswagen in one factory.
This has never happened in the past. The logistics concepts of the last 20 years no
longer ﬁt here.
NLK is used on a broad basis at AUDI and in the overall Volkswagen Group. The
aim is the optimization of the supply process between suppliers and the Volkswagen
Group. Through exact matching of supply schedules with shorter lead times,
improvement in the ﬂow of goods will be achieved. Advantages for shipment
handling on the supplier side will result in: shorter lead times; better planning of
production through “frozen periods”; and a reduction in production materials.
In the past, VW used inventory to supply production. To be able to react to any
demand from production, materials had to be stored. But if material only sits without
moving, no value is added for VW. It is a waste which will be sustainably eliminated
in the new system.
The idea is to make processes leaner and thus reduce lead times. The production
and logistics processes must be synchronized. If production has a cycle time of

5.1 Introductory Case Study “New Logistics Concept (NLK: Das Neue. . .

113

1 min, meaning that every minute one vehicle leaves the assembly line, then VW will
also apply this cycle time to logistics, from the line back to the supplier: this is new.
One can imagine it working like this: there is cycled trafﬁc in the direction of the line
to the material input. If there are 20 parts in a bin, the bin needs to be exchanged after
exactly 20 cycles; VW needs to apply the same cycle time back to suppliers.
In the development of the concept and its implementation, all parties are intensively involved and make substantial contributions. Collaboration with the factories’
logisticians is very important. Mr. Stein, head of the NLK project said (AutomobilProduktion 2014):
We are optimizing ourselves from inside to outside. We have a number of internal and
external customer relationships within our processes, so the assembly line worker is a
customer of the supplier. The optimized interaction within production was the starting
point for consideration. We are speaking of a triangle; that means the assembly worker
has a spot at the vehicle he is working on and a bin from which he gets the needed materials.
Now the material availability is organized in a way where he literally does not have any
walking routes and therefore the focus is on value-adding activities. Formerly, the materials
were stored in multiple bins; today we are sequencing the material before sending it to the
assembly line. This sorting is already happening, if possible, on the supplier side.

Such a concept is called “supermarket”. The materials are apportioned and
prepared for each sequence in the line.
The IT systems are also one of the success factors of the project. As the
Volkswagen Group has focused on reducing lead times, it is necessary to adjust
EDI (electronic data interchange) ﬂow by planning exact pick-up and delivery times.
This way, during a pick-up of goods, the freight forwarder does not need to stop at
only one supplier, but can make multiple stops along a ﬁxed route (so-called milk
runs). This process must be visible in the new EDI ﬂow. New to the NLK process is
the use of the order message system, EDIFACT GLOBAL DELJIT, which
documents precisely the order process for the goods.
It looks like this. The retrieval module processes the preview received for
production planning. It is used for rough classiﬁcation of the scheduled pick-ups.
More detailed orders/ﬁne planning are processed through dispatch calls. In the JIT
module, the dispatch calls received are shown. An overview of all orders can be seen
and additionally printed out. The JIT monitor shows the orders, supervises all of the
orders, and tells the supplier when the next delivery is needed. On the JIT monitor,
information is split up in DELJIT by date and customer. The current delivery
statuses are shown on the monitor and provide information about all materials
delivered. Each delivery is announced through an EDI delivery note. The transfer
of delivery notes should be made during the dispatch of transport by the supplier.
The goods that are to be delivered should also be marked with a goods label. The
former VDA4902 barcode label is replaced by the new global transport label (GTL).
There also exist optional modules for direct connection to the ERP systems. Radiofrequency identiﬁcation (RFID) is also employed in material logistics. Meanwhile,
the readability of active and passive transponders is excellent. However, it will be

114

5 Sourcing Strategy

some time before there is broad implementation. The tags with which the bins have
to be equipped are, at the moment, still too expensive.
The concept will be implemented step by step at all worldwide locations. Naturally, not everything can be achieved at once. The time frame is greatly inﬂuenced by
product start in the factories. With a new product, new processes will also be used.
Therefore complete implementation will stretch over the coming years. During this
type of planning, there is a program that is constantly changing, unlike a project
which is completed after a few years. VW has started to optimize their in-house area,
and now they are starting to step outside, into supply and transporting networking.
Close collaboration with suppliers and service providers will change the in- and
outbound processes step by step.

Sourcing Process and Principles

5.2.1

Procurement, Purchasing and Sourcing

This section deals with the deﬁnition of procurement, purchasing, and sourcing
which can be differentiated as follows (see Fig. 5.1).
According to Lysons and Farrington (2012), purchasing is “the process of
procuring the proper requirement, at the necessary time, for the lowest possible
cost from a reliable source”. Purchasing deals mostly with commercial activities and
is related to transactional, ordering processes.
Procurement covers a broader scope than purchasing and covers both
acquisitions from third parties and from in-house providers. It also involves options
appraisal and the critical “make-or-buy” decision.
Sourcing needs to be understood as the entire “set of business processes required
to purchase goods and services” (Chopra and Meindl 2012). The correlated activities
range e.g., from the selection of suppliers, to drawing up contracts, product design
and collaboration, to evaluation of supplier performance. Broadly speaking, sourcing is the process of establishing and managing supplier relationships in the SC. In
the narrow sense, sourcing is related to the activities and processes which provide the
enterprise with materials, services, capital equipment, means of production, tools
and supplies for work, etc. from external suppliers or partners. In practice, sourcing

integrates the strategic and operative decision-making levels and coordinates supply
strategy, procurement, and purchasing activities. It is a fundamental element of
SCOM as it is the linking process which provides the organization with the inputs
required for the creation of their products or services.
Sourcing is a very important activity in the SC. The purchased parts and materials
can account for over 60% of the cost of ﬁnished goods; for retail companies within
the SC this can be as high as 90%. The quality of purchased material, costs of goods
bought, delivery of goods or services on time, supplier management, and supplier
relationships are some of the factors that have a signiﬁcant impact on SC performance and place particular demands on procurement managers. As sourcing is a very
important and broad subject, this chapter focuses on the principles, processes and
organizational factors around sourcing strategies in SCOM and related activities.

5.2.2

Sourcing Process

In general, the sourcing process connects the supply side with the demand side, so
that the so-called sourcing objects will be made available to the requestor. This is
illustrated in a simpliﬁed way in Fig. 5.2, which depicts the high-level linkage
between the requesting and the supplying side. In order to better understand the
details behind these processes, it is important to develop a clear understanding of the
content and objectives of sourcing activities, which include the following elements:
• Determination of material requirements: the type, composition, conﬁguration,
quality, volume, location, and timing for the delivery of the sourcing objects;
• Order management: determination of order volumes, frequencies, times, and
speciﬁcation of logistical conditions. Also the supervision of accurate deliveries,
goods reception, invoice control and approval can belong to the generic sourcing
process;
• Supplier base research, observation, and analysis: analysis and evaluation of the
supplier base, assessment of potential new partnerships, and elaboration of
(strategic sourcing) recommendations, preparation of negotiations, contracts, etc.

process [based on Kummer
et al. (2013)]

• Make or buy decisions: identiﬁcation of internal/external value adding scope
depending on the core competencies, but also comparison of capacities, lead
times, costs, etc.
• Supplier management: auditing suppliers, running performance management
assessments, e.g., regarding on-time deliveries, quality, reliability, ﬂexibility,
etc. This is also related to supplier development or initiation of a substitution of
suppliers.
It must be understood that sourcing objects can be product and non-product
related. For example, in a restaurant, there are SCs both for food (i.e., product
related sourcing) and for kitchenware (i.e., non-product related sourcing).
Table 5.1 shows a selection of related examples, but of course the table could be
extended by additional items.
The examples in Table 5.1 also indicate that a company is dealing with a large
number of different suppliers on a daily basis and ﬁrms are also in regular contact
with potential new suppliers. To make this a little bit more speciﬁc, we will show an
example of companies from the heavy investment goods industry (like turbines,
planes, trains, etc.), in which approximately 35,000 suppliers are documented in the
SRM System.
It is important to mention that not all of these suppliers are of equal importance.
The company will deal with some suppliers on a very regular basis and with others
more occasionally. Out of these 35,000 suppliers, for example, perhaps 500–600
form the core supplier base.

Make-or-Buy and Outsourcing

“Make or buy” is a strategic decision that determines if the sourcing objects are
internally made or externally sourced. Such strategic decisions might also be related
to the question of core competencies. Companies might even have their own
in-house suppliers, which prepare certain modules or systems and present them to
the assembly line once they are needed (this could be an exclusive steering wheel
that is handmade for one car customer and which is presented to the assembly line).
It could also be that propulsion components for railway manufacturers are
pre-assembled by in-house suppliers or internal wing components pre-assembled
for an aircraft producer.
"

Practical Insights For example, a car manufacturer keeps the creation of
the tools they use to produce metal components such as fenders, doors,
hoods, etc. in-house in order to avoid characteristics regarding the
outward appearance of the car being handed over to competitors in
the very early stages of the design phase. This decision for “make” is
mainly driven by the desire to avoid imitation of the car design.

Make-or-buy decisions have an impact on the overall level of in-house value
creation; respectively, it is closely linked to decisions around production strategy.
When we talk about make-or-buy, the sourcing team will need to decide jointly with
manufacturing experts whether external purchasing (“buy”) might be the economically preferable solution or if the respective part should be produced in-house
(“make”). As detailed earlier, a detailed analysis of the TCO (total costs of ownership) is highly recommended for make or buy decisions. Such a decision will also

118

5 Sourcing Strategy

need to consider competitive factors regarding core competences or the fear of
providing external parties with knowledge that would offer the opportunity for
imitations. In such cases the in-house “make” will be the preferred choice, even
when external sourcing might be considered the economically more attractive
alternative.
On the other hand, if the relevant value adding processes have historically been
performed by an organizational unit’s own people and the decision has been made to
externalize certain processes (i.e., to buy), so-called outsourcing takes place. This
means that outsourcing is a result of a make-or-buy decision. Some of the common
issues in outsourcing analysis are as follows:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
"

lower production cost
better use of available resources
focus on core competencies
cost restructuring
reduction of time-to-market
risk sharing
know-how sharing
quality issues
ﬂexibility
tax beneﬁts.
Practical Insights False outsourcing decisions may ruin a company. A
supplier for a ship building yard decided to outsource a welding process
that was placed exactly in the middle of its technological process.
However the order quantity was quite low (this was the reason for
outsourcing) and new subcontractor always scheduled these orders as
unimportant since it was not interested in maintaining a high service
level for such an unimportant customer. As a result, the lead time for
deliveries at the ship building yards increased from 10 days to 35–40
days. The procurement manager needed to contact the subcontractor
frequently and ask them to speed up the orders. In a few months, the
ship building yard cancelled the agreement. In the case of low machine
utilization at a process step, it can be more sensible to try to in-sourcing
additional orders for this machine rather than outsourcing a part of
technological processes, especially if it is in the middle of the process.

Make-or-buy is not only connected to pure manufacturing processes. For example, raw materials or single loose parts can be evaluated; it can also be applied to
modules or services, such as IT services, transportation logistics, or management of
facilities (e.g. cleaning, maintenance, or security services). Furthermore, mixed
solutions between buying and making are also possible in order to match market
demands.

5.2 Sourcing Process and Principles

119

The following selection provides a summary based on Kummer et al. (2013)
reﬂecting on possible parameters that might be considered when a company is
deciding whether to “make” or “buy”:
• Core competence/strategic ﬁt
What are the unique capabilities that are very difﬁcult to imitate?
What are the strategic objectives the company needs to meet?
Does the focus on lean production require an adaptation of the production
depth?
Is it necessary to buy more in new markets because of local content
requirements?
• Variety and/or stability on the demand side
What is level of demand we can stably meet with our existing capacity and
when is it recommended to increase peak capacity needs by temporary supplementary external sourcing?
• Production capacity on the sourcing side
Are there existing contracts (e.g. purchasing agreements or sales orders) that
need to be fulﬁlled and which will impact the make-or-buy decision?
• Autonomy
Do we jeopardize our competitive position by providing external parties with
conﬁdential drawings, intellectual property rights, new research results, etc.?
Is there a risk that we might even create a future competitor by going for a buy
decision that will lead to a know-how transfer?
• Dependency on suppliers
By increasing the level of external purchases, dependency on suppliers, their
quality, reliability, and punctuality can signiﬁcantly inﬂuence the organization’s
own reputation: Do we have a strong or weak market position and how does it
look for suppliers?
• Evaluation of the cost structure
In the case of “make” decisions, the corresponding costs are linked to e.g.,
material and labor costs, salaries, or the depreciation cost of the equipment in use.
In the case of “buy”, the decision will be related to purchasing, transportation,
handling, storage, or transportation costs.
• Financial shortage or need for capital
Especially at times of ﬁnancial shortages, the decision to externally source
parts, modules or services is an important factor as it relieves cost pressures.
In practice, decisions will, in addition to the qualitative criteria, be combined
with quantitative methods to further substantiate the selection process.

120

5 Sourcing Strategy

5.2.4

Organization of Sourcing Processes

The last dimension in the management of the sourcing process is related to the
organization of sourcing activities. This dimension is focused on the organizational
set-up of the buying party or parties. A company can buy goods on its own
individually, but it could also be that a few companies jointly specify the goods
that should be sourced from one supplier. This means that these few companies are
organizationally creating a sourcing alliance.
In terms of the appropriate terminology, we could summarize that, in contrast to
the individual sourcing process, collective sourcing might be a reasonable strategy.
Heizer and Render (2013) give as examples small manufacturers of motorboats that
formed such alliances in order to aggregate their demand for motorboat engines; or
hospitals that ordered clinical supplies in a cooperative, thus beneﬁting from the
effects of larger ordering volume.
In the case of a global player in the telecommunications industry, a company
might be in a supplier–customer relationship with approximately 20,000 suppliers in
80 countries. Many different suppliers and different parts exhibit different
characteristics: it is important to stress that a company needs to deﬁne a sourcing
strategy that ﬁts its individual purpose. Sourcing strategies will be considered in the
next section.

5.3

Sourcing Strategies

Sourcing strategies can be classiﬁed according to three basic features:
• number of suppliers (single, dual, and multiple sourcing);
• geographical supplier distribution (local, national, international, and global
sourcing);
• sourcing principles (sourcing on-stock, JIT, particular sourcing).
Let us consider these strategies in detail.

5.3.1

Single vs. Dual and Multiple Sourcing

In this area, the task is to manage the supplier base with the objective of determining
the right number of suppliers. By reducing the supplier base, larger volumes can be
ordered from one supplier (single sourcing strategy) with the objective of generating
volume bundling (scale) effects. However, dependence on one supplier might be too
high risk.
"

Practical Insights Focusing on single sourcing provides many efficiency
advantages. However, a number of recent disruptions have forced SC

5.3 Sourcing Strategies

121

managers to rethink this lean sourcing strategy since cost savings can be
overwhelmed by disruption impacts (Chopra and Sodhi 2014; Ivanov
et al. 2014). Companies which used single sourcing with suppliers in
Japan or Thailand were drastically affected by the tsunami and floods in
2011. Many production factories worldwide were stopped for several
months. Intel claimed to have lost $1.0 billion in sales during the fourth
quarter of 2011. In 2010, the eruption of a volcano in Iceland interrupted
many time-sensitive air shipments in global SCs. A fire in the Phillips
Semiconductor plant in Albuquerque, New Mexico in 2000 caused its
major customer, Ericsson, to lose $200 million in potential revenue. Nokia
was also affected by this disruption, but found alternative supply sources
within 3 days. However, this was very costly. Another risk of single
sourcing is related to product standardization. If the sole supplier
produces items which are used in many different models of a product,
the impacts of a disaster can ripple very fast through the SC, as was the
case for Toyota in 2011. This is why many companies like Samsung tend
to have at least two suppliers, even if the second one provides only 20%
of the volume (Sodhi and Lee 2007).

Thus, it might also be a reasonable strategy to cooperate with a second or third
source for a part or module. This supplier strategy is in contrast to a single sourcing
strategy and is referred to as dual sourcing or, with more than two, a multiple
sourcing strategy which both better balance the global ﬂows of material and provide
risk reduction. For example, ZARA produces their trendiest items in Europe, close to
highly dynamic and changing demand. Slow-moving items are produced in Turkey
and Asia, since lead time is not crucial and cost reduction can be achieved in
manufacturing. Li & Fung Ltd, a contract manufacturing company from Hong
Kong, has a variety of supply plans that enable them to ﬂexibly shift production
among suppliers.
The discussion above allows us to formulate some critical issues when deciding
on single vs. dual or multiple sourcing. They include:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

volume
product variety
demand uncertainty
lead time importance
disruption and other risks
transportation costs
manufacturing complexity
coordination complexity
post-sales issues.
Some of the advantages of single sourcing are as follows:

122

•
•
•
•
•

5 Sourcing Strategy

long-term agreements
price stability
suppliers included in the product development process at a very early stage
low transactional costs
scale effects.
Shortcomings of a single sourcing strategy include:

• inefﬁcient price policy;
• lead time, quality, and service issues;
• lack of collaboration with many suppliers.

5.3.2

Local vs. Global Sourcing

Looking at the location of suppliers is another aspect of a sourcing strategy. This is
related to the geographic sourcing area strategy. There are two extremes, starting
from local sourcing (limited number of suppliers, but same norms, language,
currency, shortest distance, and thus fastest reaction time in case of changes) versus
global sourcing (offering the broadest supplier base, but suffering from e.g., long
distances, different currencies, norms standards, etc.). In between these, there is also
national or continental sourcing.
In order to avoid bad decisions that might be made based only on purchasing
price, practice shows that a stringent focus on the TCO approach is highly
recommended. Due to shrinking time-to-market and the need for agile management
of the SC, the pure advantage of a low purchasing price can easily be eliminated by
the need to order large lot sizes; these may travel around the globe for weeks,
resulting in higher safety buffers, inventory, and transportation costs.
"

Practical Insights Of the 17 Louis Vuitton (LV) manufacturing shops for
leather goods, 12 are located in France, 3 in Spain, and 2 in the United
States. All manufacturing processes and development are handled at a
central workshop in Italy. LV uses external manufacturers only to supplement its manufacturing segment and achieve production flexibility in
terms of volume. It purchases its materials from suppliers located around
the world, with which LV has established partnership relationships. The
supplier strategy implemented over the last few years has enabled
requirements to be fulfilled in terms of volume, quality, and innovation
(Heizer and Render 2013).

5.3 Sourcing Strategies

123

Table 5.2 Analysis of global sourcing decisions
Advantages

Disadvantages

Local sourcing
• Same norms/standards
• Easy to reach/short distances
• Same culture, same currency, same
political climate
• Good basis for JIT deliveries
• Lower disruption risks for overall
SC
• (Very) limited supplier base or no
supplier base
• Possibly limited bargaining power
of buyer because of limitations on
supplier side

Global sourcing
• Broadest variety of available vendors
• Largest portfolio of products or
services
• Best opportunities to compare and
negotiate with suppliers due to
broadest supplier base
• Longer travel and transportation
times
• Longer response times in the event of
changes
• Possibly larger lot sizes
• Potentially different norms/standards
• Different cultures, currencies, and
political uncertainty
• Higher disruption risks for overall SC

For global sourcing, items of high volume, steady demand, and low transportation costs are most preferable. However, different chances and risks in regard to
costs, service, quality, and sustainability should be included in the analysis.
• Costs: labor, taxes, transportation, insurance, transshipment, duties, and
transactions.
• Quality: bill-of-materials, quality control, after-sales service, certiﬁcations.
• Service: on-time delivery, responsiveness, ﬂexibility, technical equipment,
image, reliability.
• Sustainability: political, economic, social issues.
Issues regarding global sourcing decision analysis are presented in Table 5.2.
Global sourcing offers access to the broadest available range of suppliers (in contrast
to local or national sourcing) and this provides many advantages. At the same time,
greater efforts and certain language skills are required to establish relationships with
global vendors or partners.
Global sourcing also requires more time for travel to suppliers and for the
transportation of goods. Factors such as currency risks or political instability can
be very inﬂuential and of very high importance, along with different cultures, norms,
or standards.
Table 5.2 shows some advantages and disadvantages of the two extreme geographic sourcing strategies: local versus global sourcing. Between these two
extremes, there are also opportunities for following a national sourcing strategy;
this would be related to an expansion of the sourcing radius, i.e., increasing the
number of potential vendors, but continuing to keep risks at a low level. A continental sourcing strategy would further enhance the accessible supplier base, but would
still limit the risk of very long transportation times and large volumes.

124

5 Sourcing Strategy

Practical Insights In practice, per commodity and part, a reasonable
strategy has to be determined by evaluating the corresponding
opportunities and risks. In many cases, a mixed strategy with a combination of local and global sourcing elements can be a good choice. For
example, Amazon prefers holding fast-moving items in distribution
centers while slow-moving items tend to be stored centrally. Apple
localized production in China, but the distribution network is global.
Such SC segmentation also helps to reduce disruption risk implications
(Chopra and Sodhi 2014).

Case-Study “iPhone”
First the iPhone is developed in California. Then the engineering team creates a bill
of materials for all the necessary components. Jointly with supply management, the
engineering team ﬁnds the best combination of equipment and producability. Since
Apple’s SC works globally, this will require components from international
suppliers. This is why a camera is produced in the USA, high frequency components
are made in Germany, and displays come from South Korea.
All the components are delivered to Shenzhen (China) where they are assembled
in the Foxconn factories. Then the customer can order the iPhone via the Apple
Online stores and UPS (United Parcel Service) and Fedex deliver directly to the
customer. All remaining iPhones are shipped to the central warehouse in Elk Grove,
California, after which they are distributed to Apple Stores and their designated
partners.
The time from designing a product until actual production is usually 10 months.
To accelerate the introduction of a new product, Apple acquires additional licences
and, if necessary, entire third-party businesses. In some cases, Apple employs
advanced payments to ensure access to strategically important raw materials. Furthermore, Apple not only builds relationships with its suppliers, but also supplier to
supplier to guarantee that the SC is not interrupted.
Generally speaking Apple relies on a few suppliers, which enables it to maintain
efﬁcient supplier management. Another advantage of focusing on a few suppliers is
that Apple can concentrate on supplier development and try to improve its performance. In addition, relevant key performance indicators (KPIs) support the impression that Apple’s SC is highly efﬁcient. The Gartner study (2014) showed that
Apple’s inventory turnover of 69.2 is signiﬁcantly higher than that of Samsung’s,
which is 18.1.

5.3.3

Just-in-Time

In order to have a sound understanding of Just-in-Time (JIT) principles, let us ﬁrst
have a look at the deﬁnition provided by the American Production and Inventory
Control Society (Lysons and Farrington 2012):
JIT is a philosophy of manufacturing based on planned elimination of all waste and
continuous improvement of productivity. It encompasses the successful execution of all
manufacturing activities required to produce a ﬁnal product from design engineering to
delivery and including all stages of conversion from raw material onward. The primary
elements include having only the required inventory when needed; to improve quality to
zero defects; to reduce lead time by reducing set-up times, queue length and lot sizes; to
incrementally revise the operations themselves; and to accomplish these things at
minimum cost.

Making what the customer needs, when it is needed, and in the quantity needed
using the minimum resources of people, materials, and machinery—this is the core
idea of JIT. JIT was developed in the 1950s by Toyota in Japan. Along with the
development of Toyota Production System (TPS), JIT became a core element of the
lean production concept. It is focused on meeting exact demands following a
production-synchronous replenishment mode, which is activated by a customer
order and is linked to all predecessing value adding steps. JIT principle closely
connects the functional disciplines of production, procurement/sourcing, logistics,
and sales. Furthermore, JIT requires the successful close cooperation of internally
and externally involved parties since it is based on the pull principle.
JIT allows the reduction of inventory at the production site, cutting of lead times,
and the increasing of productivity and responsiveness. High-value materials with
good demand predictability and steady demand can be especially recommended
for JIT.
Case Study “Just-in-Time and Just in Sequence at Volkswagen Saxony”
The Volkswagen Saxony production plant is located in Mosel. The new plant was
built as a “green-ﬁeld” concept in the early 1990s, looking back at a long car
manufacturing tradition in Saxony. It was one of the largest construction sites in
Europe. In the body plant, processes are highly automated with the help of robots.
Painting is also automated and designed with environmental considerations.
The plant produces VW Golf and Passat as well as car bodies for Bentley. The
painted bodies receive a barcode for ﬁnal vehicle assembly depending on the
speciﬁcation order by the customer. Assembly takes place on the assembly line.
Readers scan the barcodes on the bodies. The material requirements are

SAS manufactures the cockpits three kilometers away from Mosel. Perfect timing
is crucial for success. While SAS assembles the cockpits, production at VW
continues in a parallel operation. This saves time and money. VW Saxony received
the German Logistics Prize for this concept of “synchronized production in partnership”. The completed modules arrive JIT at the assembly line.

Supplier Relationship Management

When selecting a sourcing strategy, the following aspects of SRM should be
considered in practice (Geissbauer and D’heur 2010) (see Table 5.3)
SRM can be divided into four areas:
•
•
•
•

supplier analysis
supplier selection
supplier integration
supplier development (Fig. 5.4).

Let us consider these areas in detail.

5.4.1

Strategic Supplier Analysis

First, the sourcing department is obliged to perform a spend analysis in order to
analyze which supplier for which sales volume is covered for what type of part or
commodity. This means the number of purchased items requires careful analysis to
generate a basis for developing improvement scenarios. Such scenarios could be
related to adjusting (increasing or reducing) the number of suppliers or to transferring additional responsibilities to the supplier. In general, the opportunities are
assessed in the ﬁrst step of the strategic analysis phase.

128

5 Sourcing Strategy

The second strategic step is focusing on creating proﬁles for categories
(e.g. paper, metal, rubber or seats, wheels, lamps etc.) and to cluster materials or
services in order to identify repetitive sourcing patterns.
In order to develop a sourcing strategy in step three, the TCO has to be identiﬁed.
This is important for developing comparable decision papers that will also be used to
support make-or-buy decisions. The result is a condensed overview that highlights
which items will be externally sourced compared to the parts or components that will
be produced internally.
In strategic step four, potential suppliers need to be identiﬁed and screened. It
might well be that new suppliers are added after they have submitted a promising
offer. Based on deﬁned supplier selection criteria, the supplier base will need to be
critically evaluated. A set of pre-deﬁned selection criteria captures and clariﬁes
distinct attributes. These help to facilitate and speed up the assessment process
(Baily et al. 2008).
When business experts talk about a spend analysis, it means understanding how
many suppliers there are and what the monetary exchange per supplier is. Bozarth
and Handﬁeld (2013) state that a “spend analysis is the application of quantitative
techniques to purchasing data in an effort to better understand spending patterns
and identify opportunities for improvement.” The spend analysis can be used to
answer the following questions:
• What categories of products or services signiﬁcantly inﬂuence company
spending?
• How much are we spending with various suppliers?
• What are our spending patterns in different locations?
The main idea behind this analysis is to obtain a good understanding, based on
data analysis, about the spending behavior of a company with its suppliers or
partners. Depending on the question that needs to be answered, a corresponding
path needs to be taken for review of the existing quantitative information. For
example, practice shows that a company will spend a very high amount of their
sourcing costs with only a very small number of supplying or service partners.
For the analysis of such a case, the Pareto analysis is a good solution. In other
cases, where a large number of data requires careful attention, a regression analysis is
also a good approach. The teams elaborating such analyses require good skills and
competences to run such data segregation.
Along with the spend analysis, some other methods are used in practice:
1. Supplier industry analysis—Review of the suppliers, their market shares, ﬁnancial strengths, geographic coverage to obtain a structured overview of the
suppliers for certain goods and services including an understanding of the role
these suppliers play in the SC (is it a local raw material provider or a globally
acting partner who provides sub-assemblies?).
2. Cost and performance analysis—Examination of the cost drivers for the sourced
goods and services as well as developing a solid key performance indicator (KPI)

5.4 Supplier Relationship Management

model. It is recommended to analyze the value adding steps on the supplier side
and then to map cost drivers and performance drivers/inﬂuencers against the
various transformation processes.
Supplier role analysis—Identiﬁcation of the roles suppliers play in the design of
the SC: which are the suppliers that will play an active role or coordinate parts of
the SC versus vendors that only deliver their goods or services (e.g. diesel fuel
reﬁlling) in passive mode.
Business process analysis—Assessment of the business processes between the
purchasing and selling parties. In practice this analysis will help answer the
question of who from the customer side will exchange with whom how often
and how with the suppliers of the corresponding commodity. This relates to the
frequency of data exchange, processes of cooperation, documents to be transferred, and also the tools (e. g. EDI, WebEDI or supplier portals) that need to be
used in order to facilitate a structured and harmonized exchange of information,
so that the business process becomes practically alive.
Business beneﬁt analysis—Quantiﬁcation of the saving potential per commodity
and usage of these identiﬁed beneﬁts for transparent target setting purposes.
Furthermore, such a substantiated business beneﬁt analysis will also help senior
management to make decisions.
Commodity plan implementation and execution—Elaboration of a structured plan
showing for what type of commodity with which supplier what type of strategy
and tool should be implemented by whom from the organization and by when.
This means the principles of project management play a signiﬁcant role in
converting the strategy into a plan with deﬁned tasks and work packages.

Since the commodity sourcing strategy has a huge impact on the entire design of
the SC, it is recommended that, in addition to the sourcing specialists,
representatives from e.g. manufacturing, logistics/SC, quality, engineering, and
ﬁnance should be part of a cross-functional commodity sourcing strategy team. Of
course, the individual composition of the team needs to be identiﬁed case by case
depending on the enterprise, its global footprint, and industry, but overall, a jointly
developed strategy which considers the inputs and contributions of multiple relevant
functions should be the objective.

5.4.2

Supplier Selection

In this phase, the sourcing team will create a supplier short list based upon the
identiﬁed supplier selection criteria. Different approaches are possible, but in principle the task is to assess to which degree the capabilities of the suppliers meet the
customer’s selection criteria. Either they are completely fulﬁlled, or to a certain
degree fulﬁlled, or they will not be fulﬁlled by the supplier. This means in order to
identify the most appropriate vendor, commonly developed and accepted vendor
selection attributes and processes will need to be deﬁned and applied inside the
organization.

130

5 Sourcing Strategy

The selection of vendors is a multi-criteria problem which includes qualitative
and quantitative measures. According to Amid et al. (2011), the relative importance
of the criteria, sub-criteria, and, in many cases, the weighting factors are determined
by top management and purchasing managers. It is important to emphasize that
careful and proper selection of suppliers is a crucial and important element in
sourcing activities, because the performance of the overall SC signiﬁcantly depends
on every single party involved.
Once the short list is created, detailed contractual discussions and negotiations
will be initiated. Then, in this step, commercial conditions especially are on the
agenda, but logistical requirements (e.g. packaging instructions, lot sizes, transportation devices, item identiﬁcation tags, or delivery notes) are also part of the
agreements. When the contractual negotiations are ﬁnalized and the contracts are
signed, these speciﬁed agreements will become part of the daily operational
processes.
In practice, weighted models are frequently used in order to respect priorities or to
focus on more important criteria. For example, this might be quality, cost, or
sustainability. The factors of cost, quality, and delivery performance as well as
capacity, experience, service, technical capability, and ﬁnancial status are used in
practice. In addition, supplier risk exposure became an important evaluation factor in
recent years (Simchi-Levi et al. 2015; Ivanov et al. 2017; Ivanov 2018; Dolgui et al.
2018; Yoon et al. 2018). The consideration of these factors facilitates long-term
relationships with possible vendors or partners.
Task 5.1 Supplier Selection
To better understand the principle behind such systematic supplier selection, let’s
assume we are employees of a company and it is our task to evaluate two alternative
suppliers against the list of supplier selection criteria for our company. In our
example, we should have the following supplier selection criteria with the
corresponding importance weighting next to it (see Table 5.4). The sourcing department will have created a standard containing the relevant selection criteria. This list
of criteria will be used for all suppliers in order to ensure comparability of the
supplier selection that has been made in the past and for the selection of future
suppliers (Table 5.4).
Next to the company speciﬁc selection criteria are the individual weighting
percentages. In total we will always have a 100%, split over the selection criteria.
In addition, standard weighting factors will be used in practice to ensure the
consistency and reproducibility of supplier selection.
In practice you will ﬁnd that the relevant sourcing department has agreed on
requirements in order to assign points for each criterion. This will be multiplied line
by line in order to calculate the overall supplier rating value. In our example, supplier
A achieves in total a rating of 5.7 points, and for supplier B the total sum is 6.1
points. We would therefore select supplier B.
As the ratings in the table above are quite close to each other, one might also think
about maintaining good relationships with supplier A, possibly for a future

The scale ranges from 0 points (very poor) up to 10 points (excellent)

evaluation. Of course, it is not one supplier alone that is evaluated by the sourcing
department: there are multiple companies that are assessed.
Finally, since the usage of the factor-ranking method for supplier selection is very
subjective, a sensitivity analysis should be performed in the event similar evaluations
of some suppliers. Such an analysis helps to identify the impact of changes in
weights and scores on the overall supplier evaluation.

5.4.3

Supplier Integration and Development

In principle the repetitive process of sourcing execution and SC collaboration starts
now. Practice has shown that traditional purchase orders tend to be considered
inﬂexible, because quantities and delivery dates are ﬁxed (simpliﬁed view). In
contrast to purchase orders, scheduling agreements (ﬂexible agreements) are preferred in business practice, because the exact demand date and quantity will be
communicated from the ordering party to the supplier at a later stage. In this context
concerning how to conduct sourcing execution and SC collaboration more practically, usage of IT should also be mentioned. Supplier collaboration portals (e.g.,
SupplyOn, see Chap. 3) enable communication between partnering companies and
thus represent an intelligent platform in which to exchange necessary information to
initiate the corresponding material ﬂows.
Supplier development is focused on the one hand on improvement of the
supplier’s ability to implement production improvements, e.g. by practical problem
solving or by establishing continuous improvement processes. On the other hand, it
strives to improve the supplier’s cost, quality, and delivery by having supplier

132

5 Sourcing Strategy

development teams at the vendor’s facility. As the details indicate, process- and
results-oriented approaches are complementary.
Supplier development is related to active consulting support and providing the
necessary guidance to identify problems, analyze them, and solve them practically.
This might include the temporary provision of specialists or even be linked to
ﬁnancial support. Overall, the purpose is to secure, develop, and maintain a solid
and reliable supplier base.
Lysons and Farrington (2012) suggested a typical nine-step approach to systematically organizing structure and followed the supplier development process. These
steps can be represented as follows:
1. identify the critical products
(mainly strategic and bottleneck products);
2. identify the critical suppliers
(assess their current and future capabilities; does it make sense to develop
them?);
3. appraise the performance of the suppliers
(usage of a standardized KPI framework, questionnaires, checklists, or company speciﬁc assessment methodology);
4. determine the gap between current and desired supplier performance
(identify the gaps from a supply point of view and from a demand point of
view, or combined gaps, such as the level of collaboration);
5. form a cross-functional supplier development team
(who run the assessments, identify the gaps, and develop and negotiate a
possible solution approach);
6. meet with supplier’s top management team
(to identify the required degree of collaborative relationship, this helps both
sides to understand improvement needs and develop a relationship built on trust);
7. agree how the identiﬁed gaps can be bridged
(e.g. to implement an IT solution, to form joint improvement teams, to execute
a quality certiﬁcation. . . develop a corresponding plan);
8. set deadlines for the achievement of the improvements
(having an agreed upon action plan with deﬁned actions, action owners,
deliverables, and due dates);
9. monitor improvements
(during the implementation of the supplier development actions, but also
afterwards to ensure corrective measures are sustained).
In practice, such a development of a supplier is related to the establishment of a
long lasting relationship which is based on mutual trust. Furthermore, the employees
need to cooperate successfully together in order to align organizations and cultures.
This means that besides the theoretical nine steps summarized earlier, soft human
and cultural factors play an important role in achieving the objective of jointly
improving supplier performance.

Key Points

In essence, in sourcing activities, the following questions need to be assessed and
answers have to be developed in principle for the articles of the commodity
categories:
1. What should be sourced?—These are the questions regarding the sourcing
objects (e.g. single loose parts, modules, systems, services or non-product related
objects?) It also refers to questions about make-or-buy, which accounts for
outsourcing decisions.
2. How should items be sourced?—What is the sourcing tool or process that needs
to be applied (e.g. do we consider manual sourcing or do we use IT tools such as
portals or EDI? How well are business processes aligned between the supplying
and buying parties?) What is the appropriate sourcing organization, i.e. whether
to run the purchasing individually or to establish an alliance and thus follow the
idea of collaborative sourcing?
3. From whom to source?—With how many suppliers or partners do we cooperate
(do we focus on a sole supplier, do we prefer double sourcing, or is our strategy to
purchase the goods or services from multiple vendors?) Which supplier
demonstrates good performance or has further potential—who should be developed and who should be substituted?
4. From where to source?—Do we focus on cooperation with local suppliers, is our
scope connected to national or continental vendors, or is the strategy to aim for
global sourcing?
5. When to source?—How should sourcing be scheduled regarding early supplier
involvement at the stage of product development in order to jointly develop a part
or module and to agree on the most suitable delivery strategy (e.g. JIT) including
corresponding containers or stock keeping units (SKU)? Alternatively the
strategies of stock sourcing or demand tailored sourcing might be applied.
In parallel to these ﬁve dimensions are other strategic factors concerning longterm relationships with suppliers, measurement of their performance, and the steady
analysis of spend patterns which need to be conducted in order to ensure continuous
evaluation and the improvement of sourcing activities. Of course, the effort involved
will differ from company to company and industry to industry; thus this chapter is
intended to provide some guidance on fundamental sourcing strategy considerations,
the related processes, and how relationships with suppliers are connected to
the SCOM.

Introductory Case-Study DELL vs. Lenovo

Dell
The company Dell was founded in 1984 by Michael Dell, who was 19 at the time.
Starting off with only $1000 in start-up capital borrowed from Dell’s father, the
company opened its ﬁrst subsidiary in the UK only 3 years later. In 1995, Dell
became a global company and in 2001 was named the No. 1 computer systems
provider. What is it about Dell that makes it so special?
Dell is well known for its direct-sales model and its ATO or “assemble to order”
approach. This means manufacturing and delivering individual PCs conﬁgured to
particular customer speciﬁcations. Instead of pre-assembling a complete PC,
Michael Dell created a SC where inventories of components are held in a few central
locations, and as customer’s placed their orders a Dell computer is assembled exactly
to the customer’s requirements. Distribution and shipping are made direct to the

customer. Standard components are offered and customers can choose the particular
features they want to add to the technical device. Strong customer focus is an
important part of the direct model. The online channel has proven very effective
for the sale of computer hardware, and by 2009 represented about half of the sales in
this category. In 2007, Dell expanded its sales channels and started to sell PCs
through retail stores.
Most of Dell’s suppliers come from Asian countries, such as Japan (RAM chips),
Taiwan (monitors), and Singapore (disk devices). All components are then delivered
to manufacturing plants, for example in Austin, Texas (Fig. 6.1).
Using the ATO strategy, cycle times are reduced and inventory expenses are kept
at a low level, as not all varieties of products need to be stored, but only the
standardized versions. In addition, assembly is easy because the features that can
be chosen are independent from the outer appearance of the device. So Dell can offer
high-quality products at comparatively low prices.
The customer is able to choose between what type of processor, software, or
storage they want in their device. However, the touch and feel experience of the
device is lacking and Dell has little presence in retail stores. Customers might miss
the presence of a sales expert during the purchasing process. Dell tried to overcome
this obstacle by offering hotlines and live chat with sales representatives on their
website.
Such a system allowed Dell to create a more ﬂexible SC and ensure efﬁciency.
The lead time was initially 4–6 weeks. With the ATO model, a PC could be fully
assembled in 1–2 days, and the customer would receive the order by the end of the
week. This signiﬁcantly reduces inventory holding costs incurred during shipping
and improves customer satisfaction. With this strategy, Dell usually holds inventory

6.1 Introductory Case-Study DELL vs. Lenovo

137

for less than 4 days. By using a postponement assembly strategy, Dell is able to
generate cash much faster and reinvest this cash into improving their SC model.
Even though Dell was a so-called rule-maker when they introduced the direct
model, market changes forced the company to rethink its strategy. The model was
mainly meant for mass production of personal computers for business customers.
However, today most sales are generated by laptops for end customers.
“We discovered that only one in four of our customers were using the direct
model anymore,” says William Hutchinson, Dell’s vice president of global logistics.
While the direct model worked phenomenally well when Dell was aiming for a
largely mature customer base, its customers today are as likely to be from emerging
markets with immature infrastructures.
In autumn 2013, the company went from being a public company to a private one
so that there could be more ﬂexibility in decision making. Future product lines are
now storage, networking (e.g. Dropbox), and cloud computing. For storage media,
the direct model no longer applies as there is little or no reasonable adaption to the
product necessary. Hence, in this product area it is difﬁcult for Dell to gain a
competitive advantage. Most likely, producing via a make-to-stock (MTS) strategy
would be more reasonable. Additionally, with increasing demand, the risk of stockouts due to low inventory is also increasing. Moreover, some customers are demanding more than low prices. To improve the approache to these high-end customers,
Dell will implement a “premium product line”. In the future, Dell will most likely
have a hybrid strategy and use both MTO (make-to-order) and ATO.
Lenovo
The Lenovo brand appeared in 2004, but the company has a much longer history,
starting in Beijing in 1984 as the New Technology Development Company (NTD
Co.) of the Institute of Computing Technology (ICT) of the Chinese Academy of
Sciences (CAS). In 1988, the company was expanded into Hong Kong and grew into
the largest PC company in China. In 2004, it changed its name to Lenovo, and in
2005 it acquired the former IBM Personal Computing Division. Currently, Lenovo is
one of the world’s largest PC manufacturers. It has more than 33,000 employees in
over 60 countries and operates in more than 160 countries worldwide.
A global SC at Lenovo was established in accordance with functional, geographic, and “internal customers” dimensions. In order to increase customer service
in major markets, Lenovo established “strongholds’ in Europe, America, Singapore,
and Shenzhen, China to provide customers with business and ﬁnancial services (see
Fig. 6.2).
Lenovo’s SC includes raw material procurement, production in three locations
(Beijing, Shanghai, Huiyang), product distribution, transportation, warehousing
(outsourcing), and payment. Lenovo’s inventory cycle is now within 10 days, and
the cash cycle can be achieved within 10–20 days. These performance indicators
contribute to relatively high proﬁts for Lenovo China.
In October 2005, Lenovo announced a new organizational structure, composed of
production, marketing, and logistics. Lenovo bases product development and marketing in Hong Kong. This enables Lenovo’s technical staff to receive timely market

138

6 Production Strategy

Fig. 6.2 Lenovo’s supply chain

and technical information and understand the progress of market and technical
factors. This also shortens the company’s product development cycle and company
products can keep up with international trends.
Production is mainly organized in Shenzhen and other production area in mainland China. The labor costs and price of real estate in mainland China are much
lower than in Hong Kong. Locating the production processes on the Chinese
mainland helps reduce manufacturing costs. In addition to Lenovo’s own investment
in the construction of production factories in Shenzhen and other places, Lenovo
also develops cooperative relations with other domestic manufacturers.
In procurement and inventory management, Lenovo integrates procurement,
production, distribution, and logistics into a uniﬁed system with over 300 suppliers.
In addition, the company has more than 5000 customer channels in China. Purchase
of raw materials such as monitors, hard drives, video cards, and even chassies and
other parts are typically organized in collaboration with suppliers in Taiwan, which
is a world supply centers for IT components.
In production and inventory management, Lenovo takes a combination of MTS
with a large margin of safety, and MTO production with a relatively low safety stock
of ﬁnished goods to cover demand for only a couple of days. In mainland China,
Lenovo’s suppliers operate warehouses near Shanghai, Beijing, and Huiyang so that
these three factories can receive deliveries faster. Recently, Lenovo opened production facilities in the United States to improve the relationship with its business
customers and to be able to offer more ﬂexible support.
Lenovo also uses a VMI purchasing pattern. In accordance with Lenovo’s VMI
project, its inventory manager, BAX Global Freight Logistics Ltd, as third-party
logistics, is responsible for inventory control. The third-party logistics company is
responsible for replenishing the production line at the right time with right items in

6.1 Introductory Case-Study DELL vs. Lenovo

139

the right quantity. VMI relies on sharing information between suppliers, third-party
logistics, and Lenovo, and ensures timely delivery of materials needed for production. VMI brings considerable beneﬁts to production and inventory management at
Lenovo. First, its internal business processes are streamlined. Second, it places the
inventory closer to production and enhances the elasticity of supply and better
responds to changes in market demand. Third, it improves inventory liquidity.
Fourth, through visual inventory management, Lenovo can monitor suppliers’
delivery capabilities online. Eventually, it will accelerate Lenovo’s logistics,
shortens lead times, and ensures timely delivery of the materials required for
production: since the Lenovo SC is shortened, costs are reduced and ﬂexibility is
enhanced.
In the distribution phase, Lenovo and partners form a closer relationship, with
timely information sharing and precise and efﬁcient integration of operations.
Lenovo’s distribution channels are distributors, agents, distributors of contract, and
distributors of non-contract. Lenovo subdivides functions of different channels and
uses two channel systems, i.e. one for home computers and one for business
computers. Due to their different target customers, distributors can establish good
relationships with their customers, which is helpful in opening up the market while
avoiding strong competition among themselves. Lenovo adheres to the secondary
distribution system, namely a maximum of two levels between Lenovo and
consumers, because excessive levels would reduce the efﬁciency of operations and
increase Lenovo’s management costs. Lenovo has adopted a selective distribution
strategy. On the one hand, Lenovo can reach markets through the distributors. On the
other hand, by selecting and training core agents and distributors, Lenovo is able to
provide users with better solutions. Through the development of secondary channels,
Lenovo ﬂattens the structure of its distribution channel. Direct shipments are
organized for MTO production. As with Dell products, customers are able to order
Lenovo’s products online, but without any adaption tailored to customers.
To manage the complexity of the SC, Lenovo uses an ERP system from SAP.
ERP helps Lenovo to run effective SC execution. By monitoring huge amounts of
SC data in real time, Lenovo has access to more accurate information, helping to
enable fast decision making, facilitating a responsive SC, and improving logistical
efﬁciency. It also provides end-to-end visibility of the entire global SC, and increases
transparency and efﬁciency with real-time access across the SC.
Discussion

2. Explain the interconnections between the production and distribution strategies at
Dell and Lenovo.

Postponement and Modularization

6.2.1

Problem: Mass Production or Product Customization

Henry Ford said: “A customer can have a car painted any color that he wants so long
as it is black”. Until the 1970s, mass production dominated the industries and
markets. The advantages were low unit costs because of rare machine setups, large
batch material ordering, and use of standard technologies and materials. Since the
1980s, customers have played a more and more important role in the SC. Products
become individual and customized. This ﬂexibility creates competitive advantages,
but is also costly. Machines should be set up frequently, lot-sizes in manufacturing
and procurement become smaller, and the variety of technologies and materials rise.
In this context, the problem is to determine the right production strategy for the
SC in order to combine the advantages of mass production and customization.

6.2.2

Principles: Postponement and Modularization

In an era of a customer-oriented product individualization and global competition,
companies are struggling to ﬁnd ways to improve responsiveness without holding
huge ﬁnished goods inventories. Postponement and modularization are useful tools
in this regard.
The postponement concept was ﬁrst introduced in literature by Alderson (1950),
where it was observed that products tend to become differentiated as they approach
the point of purchase; later this concept was further developed by Bucklin (1965). In
addition to postponed forward shipment of goods (time postponement) and
maintaining goods at a central location in the channel (place postponement), certain
manufacturing activities can also be postponed (Van Hoek 2001). Although this
differentiation improves marketability, the manufacturability of the products
becomes more complex.
Van Hoek (2001) deﬁnes postponement as “an organizational concept whereby
some of the activities in the SC are not performed until customer orders are
received”. Postponement is especially useful for:
• Signiﬁcant number of variants of an end product with an uncertain split of
demand on variants.
• Delivery time requested by customers must allow value-adding steps after receipt
of customer orders (or reliable demand forecast).
Differentiation of a generic product into a speciﬁc end-product is shifted closer to
the consumer by postponing identity changes, such as assembly or packaging, until
the last possible SC location. This allows safety stock to be held as one generic
product instead of multiple speciﬁc end-products. Especially in cases where the split
of demand into speciﬁc end-products is uncertain, postponement with its risk
pooling effect leads to a lower safety stock requirement and a lower risk of

6.2 Postponement and Modularization

141

obsolescence of end-products. Furthermore, as less value has been added to the
generic product than to the speciﬁc end-product, less capital is bound in each
stocked unit.
The concept of modularization implies a product design approach whereby the
product is assembled from a set of standardized constituent units. It provides
opportunities for exploiting economies of scope and scale from a product design
perspective. The key issue here is to design efﬁcient linkage mechanisms in the
constituent units so that any required combination can be conveniently assembled.
Baldwin and Clark (1997) describe modularity as “building a complex product or
process from smaller subsystems that can be designed independently yet function
together as a whole”. The ideas of the integration the product and process modularity
have been extensively investigated in the mass customization approach.
Ernst and Kamrad (2000) introduced a conceptual framework for evaluating
different SC structures in the context of modularization and postponement. In the
analysis, modularization is linked to postponement. The paper introduces taxonomy
and develops a corresponding framework for the characterization of four SC
structures, deﬁned according to the combined levels of modularization and postponement: rigid, postponed, modularized, and ﬂexible.

6.2.3

Examples of Postponement Strategies

Asian Paints (Shah 2009)
Asian Paints is an Indian paint manufacturing ﬁrm that has employed a postponement strategy in its emulsions product category. Asian Paints offers four emulsion
brands. In turn, each brand offers 150–250 shades. Offering a wide variety of color
shades is essential in the emulsions market. An emulsion comprises a “base” and a
combination of “stainers”. The base provides the functional aspects while the
stainers provide the required shade. The base accounts for 99% of the ﬁnal emulsion
volume. A wide range of shades is developed using just 10 stainers. At Asian Paints,
the mixing of the base and the stainers, also known as “tinting”, is carried out at the
various sales points (SPs) distributed across the country. On average, there is one SP
for every 400 retailers. At the retailer point, the customer chooses from a range of
150–250 shades.
The retailer immediately forwards this order to the SP. The effective time for
tinting is about 10 min. The customer collects the shade of her choice within 1–2
days of placing her order. Except for certain fast-moving shades, the inventory at the
SP is mainly bases and stainers. The SPs order these periodically from their
designated regional distribution centers (RDCs). The factory warehouses replenish
the RDC inventories periodically. The periodicity of ordering depends on the
demand volumes. The RDC lead times (factory to RDC) are in the range of
2 weeks to 1 month while the SP lead times (RDC to SP) are in the range of 1–2
days. Thus, the delivery period would be close to a month if the tinting operation
took place at the factory itself. Tinting is a low-technology operation due to low
capital expenditure and simplicity. The delayed differentiation due to postponement

142

6 Production Strategy

of the tinting operation has reduced the inventory levels drastically. Customer
service is high because of the reduced delivery period. Forecasting errors are also
considerably reduced. There is no loss of scale economies as a result of the
postponement. Being a simple operation, product quality is not diluted because
operations were transferred from the factory to the SPs.
Asian Paints revolutionized the postponement concept in the Indian paint industry. Asian Paints has been offering substantially higher numbers of shades and
maintains its ﬁnished goods inventories at about 60% of the industry average. This
has helped them to maintain proﬁtability consistently higher than the industry
average, and has probably contributed to increased market share over a period
of time.
Automotive Industry (Appelfeller and Buchholz 2011; Kagermann et al. 2011)
Modular design is an important method for controlling and reducing complexity.
Using identical components and modules signiﬁcantly reduces diversity and complexity. Limited, accurate, and deﬁned components and modules, which are assembled to create individualized ﬁnal products, result in outward diversity and inward
standardization. In the automotive industry this approach has become known as a
platform strategy which can be used within or across product lines or brands.
From the customer’s perspective, postponement means being able to specify
requirements as late as possible in the production process. Vehicle manufacturers
are particularly well known for this practice. For example, BMW customers are able
to modify their personalized vehicle up to 5 days before assembly begins. In turn, a
gearbox or seat supplier has to defer production until the precise requirements are
known.
While the implementation costs are signiﬁcant, postponement in combination
with JIT has many beneﬁts:
• Lower inventory costs for ﬁnished goods, but also for raw materials and work in
process (WIP);
• Lower risk of product obsolescence;
• Simpler forecasting and greater responsiveness;
• Customized products can deliver competitive advantages, such as time to market,
as well as command a price premium.
If a company shifts ﬁnal assembly to a time and location close to the customer in
time or space, it can supply more personalized solutions and avoid make-to-stock
production, while still realizing economies of scale.
A good example of successful implementation of the postponement strategy is the
automobile manufacturer Toyota (Belson 2011). Building brands such as Toyota,
Lexus, and Scion in its own factories in Japan, Toyota afterwards ships the cars with
the aim of selling them internationally. Toyota employs port facilities, e.g. a 98-acre
operation at Newark’s port is a scaled-down assembly plant. Cars, destined for sale
from Virginia to Maine, are modiﬁed at the Newark port according to a customer’s
special request at very short notice.

6.2 Postponement and Modularization

143

A range of so-called port-installed options can result in 21 different models. The
average length of time spent at Toyota’s facility is 8 days for the up to 12,500
vehicles arriving by ship at any one time. Between 2 and 6 days are required for the
necessary adjustments and it takes on average another 1.9 days for a car, once
completed, to leave the facility.
By completing the modiﬁcations within 8 days and allowing the customer the
possibility to adjust his/her order in regard to the car’s conﬁguration—including
satellite radios, tires, rims, bumper protectors, body mouldings, and a variety of
exterior items—until 2 days before the car arrives in Newark, Toyota achieves better
customer service and higher customer satisfaction. In addition, having established a
close relationship with suppliers and only ordering daily the accessories needed for
the next 2 days, the facility has reduced its just-in-time inventory by 70% within the
last 4 years.
IKEA (Cheng et al. 2010; Kagermann et al. 2011)
With production in 41 different units worldwide, IKEA controls a SC for approximately 9500 ﬁnished products. The “Range Strategy & Product Development
Supply Chain’ group is in charge of handling the SC as smoothly and efﬁciently
as possible. IKEA developed the concept of ‘design for logistics” (DFL). DFL
focuses on the design of the product not only according to customer requirements,
but also to ensure efﬁcient handling and transportation. This results in more efﬁcient
stocking of items and the so-called ﬂatpack approach, in which most items are
packaged in ﬂat, easy to handle packages. IKEA ultimately aims for a 75% ﬁll rate
for its trucks. Due to vertical integration, IKEA produces “make-to-stock”, which
means they follow a push strategy. This strategy comes with many advantages on the
one hand, but also with some risks on the other. For one, the “make-to-stock”
approach requires accurate forecasting of demand to manage the trade-offs between
costs (transportation cost/inventory cost) and service level (availability of items).
Therefore, IKEA is engaging in risk when pooling activities such as:
• postponement (last step of the SC is the assembling of the product by the
customer)
• material standardization (uniform screws, planks, colors, techniques)
• inventory pooling (at warehouse or in store)
• product pooling (similar kinds of products).
IKEA has taken the concept of manufacturing postponement to an extremely high
level: ﬁnal assembly of many furniture items occurs in people’s houses. The
company works closely with its suppliers to source and design attractive furniture
that can be location-neutral and ﬂat-packed whenever possible, making its products
acceptable in many countries while keeping transportation and warehousing costs
low. All products in IKEA retail stores are kept in a semi-ﬁnished form (ﬂat packs)
and are assembled by customers or deliverymen after home delivery. In this way,
truckload capacities can be better utilized and conﬁgurations can be easily made at
customer locations.

6 Production Strategy

Push–Pull Views and Order Penetration Point

The push/pull view of the SC divides SC processes into two categories based on
whether they are executed in response to a customer order (downstream SC) or in
anticipation of customer orders (make-to-stock, upstream SC). Pull processes are
initiated in response to a customer order. The pull advantages are responsiveness,
and a high degree of customer-oriented product individualization. Push processes are
initiated and performed in anticipation of customer orders. The advantages of this are
economy of scale (low manufacturing and transportation costs), ﬂexibility (high
level of inventory), and short supply times.
This view is very useful when considering strategic decisions related to SC
design, because it forces a more global consideration of SC processes as they relate
to the customer.
The main idea behind postponement is to delay product differentiation at a point
closer to the customer. This point is also known as the order penetration point (OPP)
(see Fig. 6.3).
In the case of a customer inquiry or order, the goods can be delivered from a
general inventory holding unit (trajectory α) or customized according to the inquiry
or order (trajectory β). Upstream of the OPP, the processes are designed to be lean.
Downstream the processes are designed to be agile.
Three categories are primary relevant to the OPP location:
• Delay of product differentiation—postponement,
• Design and developing standard or generic conﬁgurable products that can be
customized quickly—product modularization,
• Implementation of speciﬁc collaboration strategies, inventory strategies, buffers,
etc. to fulﬁl service level objectives—agility.
In practice, a selected postponement strategy determines the OPP location. The
further upstream the OPP is located in the SC, the more manufacturing and logistics
activities are postponed. In general, the aim is to postpone manufacturing and
logistics as much as possible and maintain high customer service standards.

Fig. 6.3 Order penetration point

6.4 Selection of a Production Strategy

145

The OPP location is dependent on a number of factors.
Factor 1. Costs of inventory holding. This factor has been highlighted in literature
as one of the most important for analyzing postponement strategies.
Factor 2. Costs of modularization. High costs of modularization are the main
drawback of postponements.
Factor 3. Costs of information systems installation and running. However, the
introduction of new IT costs a lot of money.
Factor 4. Costs of replenishment. Practical case studies, i.e. of DELL, point to the
conclusion that SC responsiveness highly depends on the speed of replenishment of
customer-individualized product units.
OPP location depends on products.
Factor 1. How many variants of a product are possible?
Factor 2. What is customized (product, batch sizes, and package)?
Factor 3. Which parts of the products can be customized from a technological
point of view?
Factor 4. Which parts of the products can be modularized from technological
point of view?
Factor 5. Price of products
Factor 6. What is the concurrent situation in the industry?
Factor 7. SC cycle for a product
Factor 8. Customization cycle of a product
Factor 9. Where is strategic inventory held?
OPP location depends on customers.
Factor 1. Who launches orders (individual consumer, organization, retail, or
wholesaler)?
Factor 2. Who launches the customization (individual consumer or organization)?
Factor 3. Who is the end customer (individual consumer or organization)?
Factor 4. Number of customers
Factor 5. Which contracts are used?
OPP location depends on suppliers.
Factor 1. How many alternative suppliers are available?
Factor 2. Possibility of strategic alliances under and with the suppliers
Factor 3. What contracts are used?

6.4

Selection of a Production Strategy

We already know the principles of postponement, push/pull views, and OPP. Now
we can integrate this knowledge and consider several production strategies.

6.4.1

Types of Production Strategies

With pull processes, execution is initiated in response to a customer order. With push
processes, execution is initiated in anticipation of customer orders. Therefore, at the

146

6 Production Strategy

Fig. 6.4 Production strategies in the supply chain

time of execution of a pull process, customer demand is known with certainty,
whereas at the time of execution of a push process, demand is not known and
must be forecasted (see Fig. 6.4).
The push/pull boundary is the place of the OPP that separates push processes
from pull processes. A product is kept as long as possible in a generic state.
Differentiation of the generic product into a speciﬁc end-product is shifted closer
to the consumer by postponing identity changes, such as assembly or packaging,
until the last possible SC location. According to the placement of the OPP, the
following production strategies can be determined:
•
•
•
•
•

Make-to-stock (MTS)
Distribute-to-order (DTO)/Conﬁgure-to-order (CTO)
Assemble-to-order (ATO)
Make-to-order (MTO)
Engineer-to-order (ETO).

A make-to-stock strategy is typical for mass production of standard products like
sugar, socks, etc. MTS advantages are low unit production costs and higher capacity
utilization because of scale effect and quantity ﬂexibility regarding demand
ﬂuctuations resulting from product standardization. Disadvantages of MTS are
higher inventory and lower production ﬂexibility.
Distribute-to-order (or conﬁgure-to-order) strategies allow a small degree of
customer individualization. It might have customer-speciﬁc packaging (as in the
pharmaceutical industry) or some individual items added to a standard manufactured
product. Advantages of DTO are higher ﬂexibility regarding product structure and
lower inventory.
Assemble-to-order presumes a higher degree of product individualization which
happens directly within the manufacturing. A typical example of ATO is car
manufacturing or DELL in the electronics industry. Assembly is performed individually for each customer from a set of standard modules. Advantages and
shortcomings of the ATO are similar to the DTO/CTO, but with higher investments
in the process, product ﬂexibility, and lower inventory.

6.4 Selection of a Production Strategy

147

A make-to-order strategy is similar to ATO, but presumes also a possibility of
customer individualization at the module/component level. This means that not only
the ﬁnal assembly from some standard modules can be individualized, but also that
the modules and components can be manufactured individually for each particular
customer. MTO can be recommended for customer-speciﬁc products with
ﬂuctuating demand. Advantages and shortcomings of MTO are similar to ATO,
but with even higher investments in ﬂexibility and lower inventory.
Engineer-to-order has the highest degree of customer individualization. An
example is the production of an Airbus 380 or a house building where the customer
is involved in the engineering and production processes right from the beginning and
can select not only individual components, but also materials and designs. ETO is
reasonable for complex products of high value where customer individualization is
crucial.
In practice, hybrid production strategies, e.g., MTO-ETO are frequently encountered (Jordan and Graves 1995; Alp and Tan 2008; Zschorn et al. 2017).
Case Study Airbus: Production Strategy and Strategic Supplier Collaboration
with the Help of AirSupply
Taking aircraft manufacturing at Airbus as an example, the following case study
describes how Airbus implements the ETO production strategy and collaborates
with its suppliers using AirSupply. Each time an Airbus aircraft is made, it is the
result of assembling a multitude of parts representing a very large volume of orders.
And what’s true for the Airbus assembly line is true for the whole aerospace industry
where not only aircraft, but also helicopters and satellites are built. Parts for
manufacturing come from multiple suppliers from all over the world. Most of
them are quite complex and need to fulﬁll the highest quality standards. Every
time delay can cause very high costs.
It is essential that all suppliers involved in the manufacture of aircraft have realtime visibility of the progress of demand and inventory to adapt to ﬂuctuations and
changes in customer requirements. In such a case, it is essential for customers and
suppliers to have a common tool that will enable them to better collaborate and to
gain visibility over demand as well as inventory.
In January 2009, EADS decided to initiate the development of a speciﬁc Aerospace & Defense industry solution to replace the current company individual SCM
solution. EADS is one of the leading Aerospace & Defense companies worldwide.
The range of products includes aircraft from Airbus, helicopters from Eurocopter,
and satellites from the Astrium division. Each aircraft is practically one of a kind.
One of the reasons why commercial aircrafts are all conﬁgured differently is that the
ordering airlines want to differentiate themselves from their competitors. The easiest
way for passengers to spot these differences is by looking at the seats and entertainment systems.
With 75%, the value added by external suppliers in aircraft manufacturing is
relatively high. A single long-range aircraft is made up of around four million
individual parts, supplied by companies from many countries. Even at the ﬁnal
assembly line, workers put together components originating from at least four

148

6 Production Strategy

Fig. 6.5 Modular production strategy (based on SupplyOn)

different countries: fuselage sections and the vertical stabilizers come from
Germany, the cockpit and central fuselage section from France, the wings from
England, and the horizontal stabilizers from Spain (see Fig. 6.5).
Where the engines come from depends on the customer’s preference. The task is
made even more complex by the generous length of time Airbus gives its customers
to submit their ﬁnal wishes. Including lead time, manufacturing takes around 2 years,
and Airbus accepts customer change requests up to as late as 6 months before
delivery (see Fig. 6.6).
Collaboration with suppliers begins only a few months after the order has been
received. This is normal for the aerospace industry and is very different to the
automotive industry, for example. Delivery dates are coordinated with suppliers at
weekly intervals, on both the capacity planning and order levels. The production of
components begins before the date on which the customer is able to request the last
modiﬁcations. Final assembly takes around 1 month. This intensive process of
coordination with suppliers is managed via AirSupply.
How does the collaboration looks like in concrete terms? The ﬁrst step is
calculating future demands via the Airbus ERP system. This always takes place on
the weekend. On the following Monday, the Airbus Order Ofﬁcer checks the
generated demand planning (see Fig. 6.7).
The next step is the approval of the requirements planning and transmission to the
suppliers via AirSupply. The supplier now checks whether he can provide what is
needed by Airbus. If the answer is yes, he sends his conﬁrmation. If the answer is no,
he can use AirSupply to propose alternative quantities and delivery dates. The Order
Ofﬁcer at Airbus then checks the supplier’s proposal and accepts it. The collaboration process has now been successfully completed and the data is transferred back to
the ERP system at Airbus.

It is evident that it would not have been possible to conduct this process by
exchanging messages in a conventional EDI format. The rules required to logically
represent this collaboration are not provided by classical ERP systems. This is why
the entire set of logical rules governing collaboration has been moved to the cloud.

150

6 Production Strategy

The ERP systems simply process the results of the collaboration. From the system
architecture perspective, the solution is embedded in SupplyOn’s cloud infrastructure. This is made up of central components that control registration of companies
and users. At the current time, around 8000 companies from over 70 countries are
using SupplyOn’s solutions.
One of the most remarkable aspects of this project was that it created a solution
for the entire European Aerospace & Defence industry and not only for the EADS
group. To make this possible, the French aerospace industries association GIFAS
formed the BoostAeroSpace initiative. SupplyOn designed the solution together
with the lead partner EADS, and the companies Dassault Aviation, Safran, and
Thales. Up to 150 people were involved in the project in its most intensive phases,
with a total of around 10,000 working days. After completion of design, development, and the pilot phase, the solution went live at the end of 2011. Shortly after, the
integration of the suppliers began.
The strategic goal of EADS and Airbus is to maintain the competiveness of the
European Aerospace & Defense industry in the long term. They are convinced that
this can best be achieved by creating a common industry solution together with
further leading companies in this sector. It was EADS’s ambitious goal to build the
best Aerospace & Defense industry SCM solution worldwide. This applies to the
functionality of the solution as well as to the underlying business model. EADS and
BoostAeroSpace opted for SupplyOn as their implementation and operating partner
due to its successful track record with a cloud-based solutions for the automotive
industry. Once AirSupply is deployed at EADS, BoostAeroSpace partners, and
further customers, it will establish itself as the industry standard.
Discussion
1. What beneﬁts of AirSupply for supplier collaboration can you identify?
2. Describe the advantages and risks of an ETO (engineer-to-order) production
strategy.
In summary, the basic trade-off in selecting the right production strategy is
between investments in ﬂexibility and reduction of costs due to the scale effects or
inventory reduction. Total ﬂexibility, inventory, and unit costs should be balanced
with customer satisfaction and service level. One possible approach to perform such
an analysis is presented in the next section.

6.4.2

Method: Lost-Sales Analysis

This task investigates the issue of how to determine what the right production
strategy and OPP location is in the SC. In the proposed model, we consider two
strategies:

6.4 Selection of a Production Strategy

151

• MTS and delivering from a general inventory holding unit and
• introducing the agile MTO part downstream from the general inventory
holding unit.
We assume that the introduction of the agile part of the SC downstream from the
OPP leads to an increase in both ﬂexibility and costs. As such, we propose a “lostsales” based treatment of the OPP location determination: the OPP location can be
determined by a comparison of the ﬁnancial results of the two strategies (with and
without OPP). With regard to this treatment, a quantitative estimation of the OPP
location can be found by relating the above-mentioned strategies to each other, i.e.,
an OPP location index can be calculated at different stages of the SC according to the
model (6.1) (Ivanova et al. 2015):

Ra  ka  C ua þ C da þ Pa þ La
D¼
! max½t 0 ; T 
R  ð C þ k  P þ k  LÞ

ð6:1Þ

where
D is the index to characterize the efﬁciency of the OPP location,
R is the revenue in case of make-to-stock,
Ra is the revenue when agility is introduced downstream from the general inventory
holding unit,
C are the SC costs in case of make-to-stock,
Cua are the SC costs upstream from the OPP when agility is introduced,
Cda are the SC costs downstream from the OPP when agility is introduced,
P are penalties of not-fulﬁlled contracts in case of make-to-stock,
Pa are penalties of not-fulﬁlled contracts when agility is introduced,
L are losses of rejected customer’s inquiries in case of make-to-stock,
La are losses of rejected customer’s inquiries when agility is introduced,
k, ka are correcting coefﬁcients to take into account future increases in sales due to an
increase in responsiveness when agility is introduced, and
t is instants of time within the whole SC cycle [t0; T].
Different OPP locations can be investigated and the best one with the maximum
value D > 1 is selected on the basis of the formula (6.1).
Task 6.1 Selection of an OPP Location
We consider a SC where four potential OPP locations correspond to the following
strategies: MTO—Make-to-Order, ATO—Assembly-to-Order, CTO—Conﬁgureto-Order, and MTS—Make-to-Stock (Fig. 6.8).
The following data is considered (Table 6.1):
Calculate the indexes D and propose the OPP location. Dmax ¼ 6.65 and
corresponds to the OPP at t ¼ 4.
Recommend a manufacturing strategy! We recommend selecting the MTS strategy as there is no need for any OPP in this SC.

Explain the push/pull view of the processes within a SC.
The push/pull view of the SC divides SC processes into two categories based on
whether they are executed in response to a customer order or in anticipation of
customer orders. Pull processes are initiated in response to a customer order. Push
processes are initiated and performed in anticipation of customer orders. The push/
pull boundary separates push processes from pull processes.
Explain the basic trade-off between responsiveness and efﬁciency of SCs in terms
of inventory. The fundamental trade-off when making inventory decisions is
between responsiveness and efﬁciency. Increasing inventory will generally make
the SC more responsive to the customer. This choice, however, comes at a cost as
added inventory decreases efﬁciency. Therefore, a SC manager can use inventory as
a driver for reaching a targeted level of responsiveness and efﬁciency according to
their the competitive strategy.
Explain the meaning of the coefﬁcients k! k, ka are correcting coefﬁcients which
account for future increases in sales due to the increase in responsiveness when
agility is introduced.

Key Points

Customers play more and more important roles in the SC. Products have become
individual and customized. This ﬂexibility creates competitive advantages, but is
also costly. The right production strategy in the SC combines the advantages of
efﬁcient mass production and responsive product customization. The push/pull view
of the SC divides SC processes into downstream (production in response to a
customer order) and upstream (production in anticipation of customer orders). Pull
processes are initiated in response to a customer order. The advantages of the
downstream are responsiveness, and a high degree of customer-oriented product
individualization. Push processes are initiated and performed in anticipation of
customer orders. The advantages of the upstream are economy of scale and ﬂexibility (high level of inventory and short supply times).
The ﬁrst element of a production strategy from the push-pull point of view is
postponement, which is an organizational concept whereby some of the activities in
the SC are not performed until customer orders are received. Postponement is
especially useful when there are many variants of an end product with an uncertain
split of demand on variants. In addition, delivery time requested by customers must
allow value-adding steps after receipt of customer orders (or forecast).
The second element of a production strategy is OPP, which separates the push and
pull parts of the SC. In practice, the selected postponement strategy determines the
OPP location. The further upstream the OPP is located in the SC, the more
manufacturing and logistics activities are postponed. In general, the aim is to
postpone manufacturing and logistics as much as possible while maintaining high
customer service standards.
According to the placement of the OPP, the following production strategies can
be determined:
•
•
•
•
•

Make-to-stock (MTS)
Distribute-to-order (DTO)/Conﬁgure-to-order (CTO)
Assemble-to-order (ATO)
Make-to-order (MTO)

Introductory Case Study Power Pong Sports, China

In 1856 Alexander Parks produced the ﬁrst celluloid, a plastic material that can be
easily melted and made into different shapes. Originally, Parks was looking for a
material similar to ivory in order to make the production of billiard balls easier and
cheaper. In the middle of the twentieth century celluloid was mainly used for ﬁlm
carriers and table tennis balls, but it has also been an important ingredient of several
explosive materials as well as weapons. It is a very dangerous material since it is
harmful and is spontaneously inﬂammable.
One of the most commonly used products based on celluloid and sold in high
quantities all over the world are table tennis balls. The majority of the annual overall
production quantity originates in factories in China and Japan. However, table tennis
balls are needed all over the world, so signiﬁcant quantities are exported. For
example, in Germany, more than 20 million table tennis balls are sold annually.

Facility Location Planning and Network Design

Transporting large quantities of products containing signiﬁcant amounts of celluloid falls into the category of transporting dangerous goods. In 2001, a container
loaded with 300,000 table tennis balls is reported to have exploded after being heated
by the sun. Due to the aforementioned hazards, more and more countries have
banned celluloid in all forms from production, trading, and handling. For these
reasons, more and more products are being replaced by celluloid-free substitutes.
Referring to the ongoing worldwide ban on celluloid, Mr. Adham Sharara,
chairman of the International Table Tennis Federation (ITTF), announced in 2011
that the ITTF was going to change the international table tennis rules in order to
allow the use of table tennis balls made without any celluloid. After this announcement, some manufacturers of table tennis balls started to redesign their
corresponding production processes in their SCs. It turns out that any waiver of
celluloid requires a signiﬁcant redesign of production processes, and investment in
new production facilities and technologies becomes necessary.
One of the major table tennis ball manufacturers is Power Pong Sport (PPS)
headquartered in China. The most important markets for PPS in Europe (measured in
goods sold) are France (FRA), Germany (GER), and the United Kingdom (UK). All
other European countries are grouped into the markets of South-Eastern Europe
(SEE), South-Western Europe (SWE), and Northern Europe (NEU). Because of the
importance of the ﬁrst three markets, PPS has long-lasting exclusive import contracts
with one retailer of sports equipment in France (TriColor Sportive), Germany
(TT Proﬁ), and the UK (Competitive Fitness).
PPS has decided to build a new factory in Shanghai exclusively for the new table
tennis balls manufactured without any celluloid. Mr. Xu Chen is head of the logistics
department at PPS and is in charge of new contracts with resellers in Europe in order
to supply the European markets with the new celluloid-free table tennis balls.
Mr. Chen has already made two signiﬁcant decisions, subject to PPS’s SC strategy:
• A contract made with a European retailer will extend for 1 year in order to ensure
that signiﬁcant quantities can be sold.
• Only the most important markets in Europe will receive deliveries directly from
PPS. This contributes to the realization of signiﬁcant economies of scale for the
shipment of the table tennis balls from Shanghai to Marseille (TriColor Sportive),
Bremerhaven (TT Proﬁ), and Felixstowe (Competitive Fitness) by maritime
container transportation in completely ﬁlled 20 foot containers.
Having monitored these settings, Mr. Chen is now going to identify reasonable
ways to ensure that, besides the three major markets, all European countries will
have access to the new PPS balls. The basic idea is that PPS will extend the contracts
made with TriColor Sportive, TT Proﬁ, and Competitive Fitness and distribute rights
among these three resellers to deliver PPS balls in SEE, SWE, and NEU countries.
Mr. Chen proposes his idea to the board of managers of PPS and gets a “go
ahead”, since his idea keeps the SC simple. However, Mr. Chen is instructed to keep

the annual distribution costs as low as possible. At the same time, his distribution
strategy has to ensure that the PPS balls are spread over the whole European market.
As a starting point for cost minimization, Mr. Chen contacts three resellers,
invites their representatives to his ofﬁce, and explains his proposal. All three
representatives are quite excited. In a few days, they get the OK from their management. Contract negotiations are established.
Mr. Chen asks the local representatives of the three resellers to estimate their
annual transportation costs from the corresponding warehouse to six markets. Since
PPS wants to be the ﬁrst to distribute celluloid-free table tennis balls in Europe, it
will cover all transportation costs for the ﬁrst-year contract. Table 7.1 contains
aggregate costs per 1000 € for the ﬁrst year. The forwarding costs from the selected
European resellers to the rest of Europe are independently assessed.
In order to make cooperation attractive for the three resellers, PPS pays an annual
ﬁxed amount to a reseller used to redistribute balls into other European countries, as
shown in Table 7.1. Furthermore, PPS does not allow conﬂicts of interest between
the three indirect markets SEE, SEW, and NEU. It guarantees that each of the six
aforementioned markets is exclusively assigned to exactly one reseller.
Mr. Chen has general agreement with the conditions from the three resellers. His
next task is to decide about the way(s) in which the PPS balls can reach the six
European markets.
Discussion
• Which resellers should PPS use to distribute the celluloid-free table tennis balls in
Europe?
• Which reseller(s) respectively should be assigned to SEE, SWE, and NEU?
• Is it necessary to use more than one reseller to serve a market?
• What happens if one of the resellers is unable to handle expected demand from
SEE, SWE, or NEU?
• Assume that a reseller has to open a new facility to handle the additional demand.
Where should this facility be located?
• How can the annual costs be kept as low as possible?

Supply Chain Design Framework

The core decision to be made in the PPS case was the selection of markets (country)
in which a base for the PPS operations should be installed. This decision was
inﬂuenced by previous choices, but also inﬂuences subsequent decisions. Strategic
decisions made by the PPS board regarding the strategy for serving European
markets through only a few entry gates were an implication of the strategic position
of the PPS SC—to keep distribution costs as low, and as simple, as possible. These
board decisions had to be considered by Mr. Chen during the selection of the
gateway country to be used to deliver PPS balls into the six European markets.
Mr. Chen has to consider these guidelines in order to ensure that the strategic ﬁt
of the PPS distribution system is achieved and preserved. On the other hand, as soon
as the gateway markets have been determined, these decisions are binding and must
be considered when making subsequent decisions. For example, if Germany were
selected as the unique gateway country to serve the European markets, the planning
of all transport operations must include consideration of the available infrastructure,
regulations, and laws. Selection of the regions (countries) involved in SC operations
is therefore an individual decision that is positioned in a sequence of other decision
tasks which must be solved in order to set up and use the distribution network as part
of the PPS SC.
In Fig. 7.1, a modiﬁed Chopra and Meindl (2012) SCD framework is presented to
show the arrangement of all decision tasks required to setup and deploy the SC.
In this framework, the SC strategy is understood as the ﬁrst decision phase. We
refer to Chap. 4, Supply Chain Strategy, regarding this phase. Phase I addresses the

compilation of those sourcing or supply regions/markets which are considered
subject to the long-term fulﬁlment of market demand. Such a region might cover a
continent, a country, an area of cultivation, or a ﬁshing ground. Also the segmentation of the total (global) market varies from local areas to continents. Phase I
provides a list of geographic regions that could be promising for the set up of the
SCD. In addition, suggestions for the installation of transportation links between
supply and demand regions are provided by phase I.
In phase II, all regions are processed individually. In each region, speciﬁc
locations (expressed by coordinates) are identiﬁed at which a facility can be installed
or from which supply quantities can inﬁltrate the SC. The output of phase II is a short
list of candidates for locations (with existing facilities or with prospective facilities)
which have been selected for cost efﬁciency.
In phase III, ﬁnal selection of the locations that will be considered in the SCD is
carried out. Multiple criteria are considered at this stage and the analysis reaches far
beyond cost minimization. Furthermore, capacities are allocated at all locations that
are considered to contribute to the fulﬁlment of demand from the markets to be
served.
Decisions associated with phases I-III fall into the category of strategic (longterm) SCD decisions. A revision of these decisions is hardly possible or implies
signiﬁcant costs. This chapter addresses these three decision phases of the location
planning framework. We discuss and investigate tools to support SC managers in
identifying the best decision alternatives. In Sect. 7.3, we introduce the warehouse
location problem as a representative example of a core decision task in the selection
of contributing regions (phase II). Tools for supporting the derivation of adequate
location selection decisions are the focus of Sect. 7.4 (phase III). Decisions
associated with phase III are considered in Sect. 7.5.

7.3

Global Supply Chain Design

Phase I of the location analysis framework addresses the selection of source regions
that are incorporated into the overall SC. From the sourcing regions selected,
markets are served such that the overall supply from the different sources covers
the demand of each individual market. The PPS case is a typical representation of a
phase I decision situation. By means of the PPS case presented in Sect. 7.1, we
develop an appropriate mathematical optimization model (Sect. 7.3.1) as the starting
point of rational decision making that incorporates computational resources to derive
optimal location decisions.
For solving this so-called (uncapacitated) warehouse location problem (WLP),
we explain the usage of a spreadsheet approach (Sect. 7.3.2) as well as the conﬁguration of a general purpose decision support algorithm called branch-&-bound (Sect.
7.3.3). Finally, we investigate the consequences of scarceness, i.e. the limited
availability of the quantities offered in source regions, leading to the deﬁnition of
the capacitated warehouse location problem (CWLP). For the CWLP, we also
propose an appropriate mathematical optimization model as well as a decision
support technique (Sect. 7.3.4).

Warehouse Location Problem and Its Formalization

The case of PPS is a representative example for a frequent decision situation related
to the SCD. First, a decision about regions (markets, countries) hosting a facility
(factory, warehouse, partner) to be used as a network node is required (“location
decision”). Second, a decision must also be made as to how those markets are
supplied from a regional facility so that the demand of each market is covered
(“supply decision”). Such a problem requiring both location and supply decisions
is called a warehouse location problem or WLP (Daskin 1995; Drezner 1995; Melo
et al. 2009; Askin et al. 2014). The overall goal to be achieved in solving a WLP is to
keep the total costs of supplying all regions as low as possible. Therefore, for each
region it has to be decided if it is more beneﬁcial to open a facility (creating ﬁxed
costs for running the facility) or use transportation links to supply a region (creating
transportation costs).
Let S denote the set of all regions in which a facility/warehouse can be installed or
used (e.g. S ¼ {GER; FRA; UK}) and let M be the set of all markets (e.g. M ¼
{GER; FRA; UK; SEE; SWE; NEU}). The set T :¼ S  M contains all possible
transportation links between a warehouse region and a market. If a facility is opened
in region s ∈ S then the annual costs rise by the amount fs. The decision to use the
transportation link (s, m) ∈ T between the facility in region s ∈ S and the market m
∈ M increases the annual costs by the additional amount csm. Using the aforementioned sets, we are able to formally present the WLP as follows.
First, the objective function (7.1) is formulated:
Z¼

X

f s  ys þ

s∈S

X X

C sm  xsm

ð7:1Þ

s∈S m∈M

The sum of (annual) costs expressed in Eq. (7.1) has to be minimized by varying
the values of the decision variables ys as well as xsm. The family ys of binary decision
variables represents the facility opening decisions. All these decision variables are
allowed to be set to either 1 (“use this facility”) or 0 (“do not use this facility”).
Similarly, xsm code the decisions about whether to use the transportation links in T
between warehouses and markets. Although the two decision categories introduced
address different managerial decisions, they fall into the same type of decisions:
exactly one of two options must be selected (binary decisions). Therefore, the WLP
turns out to be a collection of interdependent binary decisions about the opening of
the locations.
Each market has to be served from exactly one facility as is the case in the PPS
example. In order to ensure this condition when ﬁxing the values for the x-decision
variables, it is necessary to ensure that constraint (7.2) is respected.
X
s∈S

xsm ¼ 1, 8m ∈ M

ð7:2Þ

7.3 Global Supply Chain Design

161

In a case where (7.2) remains unﬁlled, then at least one market in M remains
unserved. Since the overall sum of costs for supplying all markets must be
minimized: every solution in which a market m ∈ M is connected with two or
more facilities implies higher costs and selecting one of these facilities for serving
the markets may reduce costs. In summary, in a cost optimal solution of the WLP
each market is supplied from exactly one facility s ∈ S.
Obviously, it is useless to install a transport link between market m and facility s if
s is not opened, e.g., if we set xsm ¼ 1 if, and at the same time, ys ¼ 0 then we would
end up with a useless and unrealizable solution for the WLP. In order to avoid such a
failure, we introduce the constraints (7.3) and (7.4) that couple facility installation
with transport link installation decisions and ensure that we install a transport link
only if it has been decided that the origin facility should also be installed.
xsm  ys , 8s ∈ S, 8m ∈ M

ð7:3Þ

ys ∈ f0; 1g8s ∈ S, xsm ∈ f0; 1g8ðs; mÞ ∈ T

ð7:4Þ

Using the mathematical model (7.1)–(7.4), we are now ready to state precisely the
WLP problem as follows:
It is necessary to minimize the total costs for the installation of facilities and
transportation links subject to Eq. (7.1), so that each market is served by exactly one
facility (7.2). If we use a facility for supplying a market, then this facility must be
open (7.3). Each available facility is either opened or closed and each available
transportation link is either used or not (7.4).
A pure, formalized problem formulation is as follows: “minimize (7.1) while
taking into account (7.2)–(7.4). The collection of mathematical expressions (7.1)–
(7.4) is a mathematical model for the WLP. This model represents the underlying
decision problem in a formal way. A solution to this model is comprised of a
selection of values for each of the y-decision variables as well as each of the xdecision variables. Such a solution is called feasible, if and only if, all constraints
(7.2)–(7.4) are fulﬁlled, e.g., if the implementation of the selected values for the
decision variables leads to logically true statements. Every feasible solution of the
proposed WLP-model that leads to a non-dominated objective function value is
called an optimal solution of the WLP-model. Such an optimal solution can be used
to derive an optimal solution to the underlying real world WLP.
If we want to use the WLP model to represent Mr. Chen’s problem in the PPS case,
we ﬁrst have to collect all relevant planning data. The set S of potential regions hosting
a facility is compiled as S ¼ {GER; FRA; UK} and the set of markets M equals {GER;
FRA; UK; SEE; SWE; NEU}. Consequently, the set of transportation links is formed
as T ¼ {(GER;GER); (GER;FRA); (GER;UK); (GER;SEE); (GER;SWE); (GER;
NEU);(FRA;GER); (FRA;FRA); (FRA;UK); (FRA;SEE); (FRA;SWE); (FRA;
NEU); (UK;GER); (UK;FRA); (UK;UK); (UK;SEE); (UK;SWE); (UK;NEU)}. The
cost coefﬁcients representing the annual running costs for an opened facility are fGER
¼ 95, fFRA ¼ 90 and fUK ¼ 70. Finally, the cost coefﬁcients for the annual distribution
costs in Europe are cGER;GER ¼ 1; cGER;FRA ¼ 24; cGER;UK ¼ 19; cGER;SEE ¼ 11; cGER;

Mr. Chen puts all the aforementioned data into the general WLP model and
obtains the following mathematical optimization model that represents his SCD
problem in Europe as mixed integer linear programing (MILP) model by (7.5)–

The fairly small SCD problem in the PPS case is represented by the mathematical
model (7.5)–(7.13). Although only three potential facility sites and six markets are

7.3 Global Supply Chain Design

163

involved in the problem, the PPS case is quite a complex decision situation and the
proposed model is so complex that it is impossible to solve it manually. We need to
utilize the support of a computer system.

7.3.2

A Spreadsheet Approach to the WLP

Even for a rather small WLP case such as the PPS scenario, it is hardly possible to
identify a minimal cost instantiation of the yi- and the xij-values. A spreadsheet
calculation schema as shown in Fig. 7.2 is a ﬁrst step to managing the problem’s
inherent complexity and determining the costs of different decisions.

The upper part of this spreadsheet (rows 5–10) contains all relevant problem data,
which are the annual ﬁxed costs for each reseller (column C) and the costs for
installing a transportation link from a reseller into a market (columns D–I).
In the middle part of the calculation scheme (rows 14–19) setup decisions can be
typed into the grey shaded cells. The area covering cells C17–C19 is used to code the
decisions associated with the incorporation of a reseller. When “1” is inserted, then
the corresponding reseller is considered, but if a “0” is typed in then this reseller
remains unconsidered. For example, if TriColor Sportive is considered in the PPS
European distribution system, then cell C17 is ﬁlled with “1”. Similarly, “1” and “0”
are typed into the cell area D17–I19 in order to code the decisions on the installed
transportation links from the resellers into the six markets. For each market, the
number of selected resellers is calculated in row 20.
The costs for a coded collection of decisions are calculated in the lower part of the
spreadsheet (rows 24–26). The corresponding formulas are given in Table 7.2.
Theoretically, one might use the spreadsheet to test every possible combination of
“0” and “1” values in the grey shaded cells. Unfortunately, there are 221 ¼ 2,097,152
different combinations. First, each combination has to be checked for feasibility with
respect to the constraints (7.6)–(7.13). Second, for each feasible combination, the
associated costs have to be calculated using Eq. (7.5). If we assume that these two
steps can be executed within 1 second, then it takes 2.5 days to ﬁnd the best feasible
solution for the PPS-WLP setting. Therefore, testing all combinations manually is
impractical. Fortunately, spreadsheet calculation tools (e.g. Microsoft Excel, Open
Ofﬁce) provide special add-ins that assist us in testing different combinations. One
add-in is called “Solver”.
The concept of the solver tool is as follows. The user speciﬁes those cells that are
variable (here: the grey shaded cells) and the cell in which the objective function
value is contained (here: cell F26) and then the solver proposes a ﬁrst set of values
and inserts these values tentatively into the variable cells. After this, the solver reads
the value in the objective function cell. Using optimization algorithms, the solver is
now able to decide if the proposed values form an optimal solution or not. In the ﬁrst
case, the solver returns the current solution proposal by deﬁnitively inserting the
current values into the variable cells. In the latter case, the solver iterates the recent
proposal and re-evaluates this new proposal by reading the updated objective
function cell. This iteration is repeated by the solver until an optimal combination
of values for the decision variables is found or if it decides that there is no better
solution available.
Note: An Excel ﬁle pre-conﬁgured with the PPS data and a suitable solver
conﬁguration can be found in the E-Supplement. The Excel solver is an add-in

7.3 Global Supply Chain Design

165

Fig. 7.3 Parameter settings for the solver

that comes with each Excel installation. In order to use this add-in, it is necessary to
activate it before ﬁrst use. Open Ofﬁce also includes a solver tool.
Before you can apply the solver add-in to the PPS case, it is necessary to execute a
careful conﬁguration in order to provide the solver with comprehensive problem
information, e.g. to input the model parameter and decision variables. Figure 7.3
exhibits the necessary parameter settings.
First, the cell that contains the objective function value (or in which the objective
function value is calculated) is inserted into the “set objective” input box. Here, cell
$F$26 contains the target value that is the subject of optimization.
Second, the optimization goal is speciﬁed, e.g. whether the objective function
value is going to be minimized or maximized, or if a certain target value must be
achieved is established. In the PPS case, the totals calculated in cell $F$26 are
minimized.
Third, those ﬁelds that should be modiﬁed by the solver (“variable cells”) must be
speciﬁed. Here, all cells in the area $C$17:$I$19 can be varied by the solver. The

166

constraints

area $C$17:$C$19 represents the decision variable vector (yFRA, yGER, yUJ) whereas
the area $D$17 to $I$19 corresponds to the matrix of the xij-decision variables.
Fourth, you need to specify the constraints that must be considered/that belong to
the model. Constraints are typed in one after another by clicking the add button in the
solver parameter window. Figure 7.4 shows an example of how the constraint xGER;
NEU  yGER from Eq. (7.12) is speciﬁed.
For the input of the constraints (7.2), the solver refers to cells D20–I20 where the
sum in the left side of Eq. (7.2) is calculated (Fig. 7.5).
If necessary, the decision variable domains must be restricted as shown in Fig. 7.6
to limit the values of yi and xij to either 0 or 1.
Finally, it is necessary to specify the optimization algorithm that the solver
invokes to solve the speciﬁed mathematical model. For the PPS model, we select
the option simplex algorithm since the model (7.1)–(7.4) consists of a linear objective function and of linear constraints. The solver detects that the decision variables
may only be instantiated with the values 0 or 1.
When the ﬁve steps mentioned above have been executed, the solving process is
initiated by clicking on the “Solve” button. Now the optimization routines start the
optimization process and write the ﬁnal solution proposal into the variable cells.
In Fig. 7.7 the values returned for the PPS case have been written into the variable
cells.
The optimal design of the PPS-network in Europe is to agree to the contract with
the reseller in Germany (y2 ¼ 1) and to forward balls from Germany to the ﬁve
remaining markets (x2j ¼ 1 for all j ¼ 1, . . ., 6). The annual costs for this design
account to 172 TEUR (thousand Euro) p.a. and this sum includes the amount of
80 TEUR paid to TT Proﬁ as a ﬁxed annual amount to cover all the reseller’s
expenses for handling the intra-European orders, as well as the costs for the
transportation links, which account for 92 TEUR p.a. This proposal reduces the

From the methodological perspective, we conducted three steps consecutively to
solve the real world decision situation:
• The real world decision situation is coded into a mathematical decision model
(“modelling step”).
• The formalized decision representation (the mathematical decision model) is
processed by an optimization algorithm which returns an optimal solution of
the model (“model solving step”).
• The model solution is interpreted as a decision proposal for the real world
problem (“model solution implementation step”).
The problem solving approach reported here is a typical example of a modelbased decision approach. The major challenge was to represent the WLP using a
mathematical model. Due to the linear structure of the objective function as well as
of the constraints, we were able to apply a black-box model solving tool to derive the
model solution.
Exercise
The management board of directors of PPS has decided to redesign the market
segmentation in Europe. The former market region SWE has been split into SouthWestern Europe I (SWE-I) and South-Western Europe II (SWE-II). SWE-I now
demands one third of the former SWE-market. The annual costs for installing a
transportation link are correspondingly split between SWE-I and SEW-II. Is it
necessary to redesign the network in Europe?
Assume that SWE remains complete. However, due to the recent success of the
Portuguese national table tennis teams, the Portuguese market has grown rapidly.
Situated in this emergent market, an additional potential reseller offers PPS the
following conditions for cooperation: Annual costs are ﬁxed at 60,000 € and for
each of the six markets equal forwarding costs of 20 € per packaging unit are
possible. Is there a beneﬁt for PPS to consider this fourth reseller candidate for its
European distribution network?

7.3.3

Branch-&-Bound: How the Solver Add-In Works

So far we have learned how to code a WLP into a mathematical optimization model.
Furthermore, we have learned how we can deploy a black-box tool such as Excel
Solver to derive a high quality (optimal) solution for the model.
Obviously, the knowledge of an appropriate decision model type is sufﬁcient to
solve the real world challenge of the WLP. However, so far, we do not have any
knowledge about the way the black-box model solver processes the speciﬁed model
nor do we have a chance to judge the optimality of the proposed model solution. In
this section, we will learn the basic principles of a model solving algorithm that
serves as the base for many decision model solvers. This technique is called
branch-&-bound (b&b).

7.3 Global Supply Chain Design

169

As the name b&b suggests, there are two interdependent activities for processing
the model. One activity is to split the problem into smaller problems (branching) and
the second activity is to estimate the best objective function value that may be
achieved by solving a model of such a speciﬁc “branch” of the overall problem
(bounding).
In this section, we explain an efﬁcient branching strategy for a WLP model as
well as an efﬁcient bounding scheme to determine the lower bound of the objective
function associated with a model for each splitting up of a WLP sub-problem.
Although the idea of b&b is applied to a fairly comprehensive collection of decision
models for a large entirety of decision problems, both the branching strategy as well
as the bounding scheme has to be adjusted for any speciﬁc model.
Let us begin the motivation and explanation of b&b algorithms with a simple
observation that is valid for the WLP model of PPS. Independently from the
decisions on the reseller selection we can determine the least required transportation
linkage costs in the following way. First, select a minimal value in each column
associated with a target market in Table 7.1. Second, calculate the sum Z(---) of the
six selected values, e.g. Z(---) ¼ 4 + 1 + 3 + 11 + 14 + 13 ¼ 46 TEUR. This value is
needed to maintain the distribution network independently from the incorporated
resellers. The fact that no reseller is selected is expressed by the three dashes “---”
where the ﬁrst dash represents the selection to incorporate the ﬁrst reseller (“1”) or
the decision to refrain from cooperating with the ﬁrst reseller (“0”).
We start the conﬁguration of a b&b algorithm for the WLP with the derivation of
an adequate branching strategy. This strategy recursively splits the model M(---) of
the given WLP model into two sub-models M(1--) and M(0--).
• In the model M(1--) we add the constraint that the ﬁrst supplier must be
incorporated (y1 ¼ 1).
• In the model M(0--) we postulate the constraint that the ﬁrst supplier may not be
considered (y1 ¼ 0).
Note that no solution of the WLP model remains unconsidered if we handle M(1--)
and M(0--) instead of the initial WLP model, since y1 equals either 1 or 0. However,
one might now ask what the beneﬁt of dealing with two models instead of one
is. In order to justify this model split, we analyze the consequences of the
model replacement.
The recently generated models M(1--) and M(0--) are “smaller” than the original
model M(---), since one of three requested decisions has already been made and only
two decisions (about the second as well as the third reseller) must be solved.
The cost estimation value Z(1--) associated with M(1--) as well as the cost estimation value Z(0--) associated with M(0--) can be reﬁned compared to the cost estimation Z(---) associated with M(---).
In the sub-problem represented by M(1--), the ﬁrst reseller is incorporated and
therefore the annual ﬁxed cost of f1 ¼ 95 TEUR deﬁnitely has to be paid in addition
to the least transportation costs Z(---) ¼ 46 TEUR so that we get Z(1--) ¼ 46 TEUR

170

+ 95 TEUR ¼ 141 TEUR: each decision alternative in which the ﬁrst reseller is
incorporated (y1 ¼ yFRA ¼ 1) creates annual costs of at least 141 TEUR.
In the sub-problem represented by M(0--), the ﬁrst reseller is not incorporated.
Therefore, no transportation link can originate from this reseller (xij ¼ xFRAj ¼
1, 8j ∈ {FRA; GER; UK; SEE; SWE; NEU}). In particular, the link FRA to FRA
cannot be used. The market FRA must be served from another reseller. Because of
this, we cannot consider these transportation links for calculation of the least
transport costs among the resellers and the markets. From the remaining links that
can be used to serve FRA, we select the cheapest link, which is (GER;FRA). Since
the linkage costs cFRA;FRA ¼ 4 but cGER;FRA ¼ 24, the least transportation cost sum
increases by 20 TEUR p.a. so that we have Z(0--) ¼ 46  4 + 24 ¼ 46 + 20 ¼
66 TEUR p.a.
Having generated the two models M(1--) and M(0--) by deciding about the
incorporation of reseller 1, we continue with the decision about consideration of
reseller 2. Both sub-problems represented by M(1--) as well as M(0--) are therefore
split into two smaller problems M(11-) and M(10-), respectively M(01-) and M(00-).
Each of these four sub-problems is then split again in order to incorporate reseller
3 into the cost evaluation (Fig. 7.8).
The tree structure of all possible sub-problems in the PPS case is shown in
Fig. 7.8. Each node in the tree represents one sub-problem determined by
combinations of involved/rejected/so far undecided resellers. A node represents an
incomplete solution of the WLP where at least one reseller remains undecided. A
node represents a solution of the WLP if there is a decision made for each reseller.
The nodes in the ﬁrst three upper levels of the tree in Fig. 7.8 represent incomplete
solutions, but the nodes in the lower level represent the different solutions of the
WLP. The solution of the model M(000) is infeasible because no reseller is used and
this is impossible. The remaining seven solutions are feasible and the solution of M
(010) with total costs of 172 is the cheapest solution available. Excel Solver has
returned the same solution.
Overall, it was necessary to set up and evaluate 15 sub-problems to solve the PPS
case. In general, WLPs come along with a signiﬁcantly larger number of potential

Fig. 7.8 Tree of sub-problems and cost estimations as well as solutions for the PPS case

locations corresponding to resellers (or suppliers). Let N be the number of supply
sources so that the number of sub-problems equals 1 + 2 + 22 + 23 + . . . + 2N. For
example, let N ¼ 5 which requires the speciﬁcation and evaluation (cost estimation)
of 1 + 2 + 4 + 8 + 16 + 32 ¼ 63 sub-problems and if N ¼ 10 then the number of
sub-problems climbs up to 1 + 2 + 4 + 8 + 16 + 32 + 64 + 128 + 256 + 512 + 1024 ¼
2047. The time needed to solve all these sub-problems is prohibitively high.
However, we can use the objective function value of the ﬁrst solution found during
a b&b execution to reduce the number of sub-problems that must be set up and
evaluated. For this reason, we analyze the sequence in which the sub-problems are
generated (Figs. 7.9, 7.10, 7.11, 7.12, and 7.13).
After the ﬁrst branching step on the decision about the incorporation of reseller
1, we have two sub-problems. We now select the sub-problem with the lower cost
estimation and assume that the ﬁrst reseller remains unconsidered (Fig. 7.10).
The right-hand sub-problem represented by M(0--) has a lower cost estimation
value and will be split up next. For this reason, we generate the sub-problems 01- and
00- and determine the lower bound of the costs (Fig. 7.11).
Figure 7.11 contains the current stage of the decision tree. The right-hand
sub-problem represented by M(000) is infeasible, but the left-hand sub-problem
corresponds to the ﬁrst complete and feasible solution with costs of 181. We set the
current least cost to Zleast:¼181 TEUR. Since both sub-problems 001 and 000 cannot
be split up further, it is necessary to go back to the previous level and to investigate

the open sub-problem represented by M(01-). Such a step back into a higher level is
called a backtracking step (Fig. 7.12).
After backtracking has been done, we expand the sub-problem 01- and obtain two
new solutions for the WLP. The costs from solution 011 are 226 TEUR and do not
improve the least cost Zleast of the best solution found so far. Solution 010 creates
costs of 172 TEUR which improves Zleast so that we may update Zleast and set Zleast
:¼172 TEUR, tracking back to level three. Since there are no open sub-problems left
in level three which have not been processed we track back into level 2 and process
the open sub-problem 1-- (Fig. 7.13).

7.3 Global Supply Chain Design

173

Fig. 7.13 Tree after double backtracking and ﬁfth branching step

We generate sub-problem 11- as well as sub-problem 10- and determine the lower
bound of the costs (Fig. 7.13). For both sub-problems, the lower bounds 231 and
174 exceed the costs 172 of the least cost solution found so far. Therefore, it is not
necessary to analyze these two sub-problems any further since it is impossible to ﬁnd
an improved solution for the WLP model.
As we see from the ﬁnal tree in Fig. 7.13 it is not necessary to generate all possible
sub-problems if we save the best found solution so far.
"

Practical Insights For small instances, b&b is a suitable method. However, the solution of real-life problems involves a higher complexity. This
makes it necessary to solve the WLP by different heuristic methods
(offering no guarantee of finding the best available solution) rather
than exact algorithms. The reason for this is the high number of integer
variables. However, heuristic procedures offer no guarantee of finding an
optimal solution.

7.3.4

Capacitated WLP

We now investigate the impacts of limited capacities on SCD. Therefore, it is
necessary that we know the quantities qs (s ∈ S) that can be handled by each
reseller per year. Furthermore, in order to assign a sufﬁcient quantity to each reseller
we need to have the demand quantity dm of each market (m ∈ M). For the PPS case,
the maximal quantities that can be handled by a reseller are summarized in Table 7.3.
Table 7.4 shows the expected annual demand from the six markets. All values are
expressed in number of packing units (parcels).

Of course, there is no reseller solely able to serve the total demand of 23,300
packing units. Therefore, it is necessary that at least two resellers are incorporated.
Consequently, at least a second annual ﬁxed handling amount has to be paid. In
contrast to the uncapacitated WLP, an optimal solution to the case investigated here,
called the CWLP or Capacitated Plant Location Model (CPLM) differs from a WLP
solution, because more than one reseller is considered in an optimal solution.
Again, we have to make a decision about the incorporation of resellers, so the
corresponding decision is coded again by the binary decision variables ys (s E S). In
the WLP we use the binary decision variable family xsm to represent decisions about
the installation of a transportation link connection supplier (reseller) s with market m.
In the context of the CWLP, it is also necessary to determine the quantity shipped
along a transportation link. Therefore, we use the family of non-negative decision
variables zsm to represent decisions about the installation and usage of transportation
links. If zsm equals 0, then there is no link installed to connect supplier s with market
m. If zsm is larger than 0, then the value zsm is interpreted as the quantity shipped
along the transportation link originating from supplier s and terminating in market m.
We have used the annual ﬁxed cost value csm to determine the annual costs for the
incorporation of the transportation link between supply location s and market m.
This parameter determines the annual costs for moving the whole demand of the
target market m from the supply source s. In the CWLP, we aim to distribute the total
demand of a market among different transportation links; it is necessary to know the
costs c’sm for moving one package unit along the transportation link, connecting
supply source s with market m. We can calculate the values for c’sm from the values
contained in Table 7.1. We explain this as an example of the transportation link
between the UK reseller and the market SEE. Here, the total costs for delivering the
market’s demand of 2800 package units are 24,000 € per year, so that each package
unit shipped between the supplier in the UK and the market SEE has a cost of 24,000

Using the transportation cost coefﬁcients per package unit as well as the decision
variables zsm for the shipped quantities, we can determine the overall distribution
costs ZCWLP per year according to Eq. (7.14).

Using the ﬂow quantity variables zsm, we can re-formulate the demand covering

also becomes possible [Eq. (7.15)].

Similarly, we have to ensure that no supplier (reseller) intends to deliver more
quantities than available to all markets together. Such a constraint is not contained in
the model of the uncapacitated WLP. The left side of constraint (7.16) calculates the
actual supply quantities delivered from supplier s to all other markets and this
quantity must not exceed the available quantity qs.

zsm  qs , 8s ∈ S

Again, it is necessary to ensure that a supplier (reseller) s sends out quantities only
if this reseller s is not considered, i.e. it is necessary to code the implication zsm 
0 ) ys ¼ 1 in a linear constraint. We can adjust the corresponding constraint (7.3)
and obtain constraint (7.17). In this constraint, K represents a “sufﬁciently large”
number, e.g. K can be set to 1000.000 in the PSS-case scenario. If zsm > 0 for a
certain market m and if Eq. (7.17) should be valid, then it is necessary that Kys >
0, which is equivalent to the fact that ys > 0 and this means that supplier s is
considered. This technique to model logical implications between non-binary and
binary decision variables is called the “big-K-method” or “big-M-method”. It is
necessary to select an appropriate value for K for each scenario that is modeled.

Using the aforementioned mathematical expressions, we are now ready to state
the CWLP challenge precisely:
It is necessary to minimize the total costs for the installation of facilities and the
shipment of packages as expressed in (7.14), so that the each market’s demand is
covered (7.15), but no supplier distributes more than its local stock quantity (7.16).
If we use a facility for supplying a market, then this facility must be open (7.17).
Each available facility is either opened or closed and the number of packages to be
shipped between each pair of suppliers and markets must be determined (7.18).
A pure formalized problem formulation of the CWLP is the following: minimize
(7.14) while the constraints (7.15)–(7.18) are respected. Figure 7.14 represents the

Fig. 7.14 A spreadsheet model of the CWLP

7.3 Global Supply Chain Design

CWLP problem in the form of an Excel spreadsheet. The necessity of considering
the limited availabilities of supply quantities at the different suppliers (resellers)
makes the CWLP solving process more challenging compared to the solving of the
WLP. In particular, it becomes necessary to redeﬁne the components of the b&b
algorithm used for the WLP. A major difﬁculty is to decide whether a sub-problem
has a feasible solution, i.e., to ﬁnd out if suppliers already considered and still
untreated can provide enough capacity to cover the demand from all markets. The
evaluation of a single sub-problem becomes quite complicated and requires huge
computational effort. Therefore, we refer the reader to the scientiﬁc literature
(Daskin 1995; Drezner 1995; Melo et al. 2009; Benyoucef et al. 2013; Askin et al.
2014) and report only a spreadsheet approach for the CWLP.
Figure 7.14 depicts a spreadsheet model that is used to provide all problem data to
the Excel Solver. Special attention is paid to the preparation of the handling of the
quantity constraints on the maximal supply quantities (7.15) as well as of the least
provided quantities to cover the demand of the individual markets (7.16).
The upper part of the spreadsheet from row 1 to row 12 contains the problem
parameter now including the locally available stock (column C) as well as the
demand expressed from the individual markets (row 12). The cost matrix (E9:J11)
contains the costs for shipping a single package unit instead of the annual costs for
serving a complete market (the annual costs for the installation of a transportation
link in the WLP).
The middle part of the spreadsheet from row 14 to row 23 contains the variable
cells (D19:J21). In addition, we calculate the fulﬁlled demand (row 22) as well as the
open (uncovered) demand for each market (row 23). The last mentioned values are
used later in the formulation of the constraints propagated to the solver. Furthermore,
we can calculate the total sum of deliveries from each supplier (column K) as well as
the excess of local stock (column L). We are going to incorporate the stock excess
values into the constraints. The lower part of the spreadsheet contains the costs
calculated from the parameters as well as from the variable cells (rows 27–29).
In Figs. 7.15, 7.16, 7.17, and 7.18, we describe the building of the constraint
system [Eqs. (7.15)–(7.18)] for CWLP.
According to the constraint shown in Fig. 7.15, we enforce the solver add-in to
avoid uncovered demand. According to the constraint shown in Fig. 7.16, the solver
add-in is instructed to prevent any excess of stock at the suppliers. The Big-Kmethod to represent the logical dependencies between the usage of a supplier and the
delivery quantities coded in constraint (7.17) is shown in Fig. 7.17, where K ¼
1,000,000,000. Finally, Fig. 7.18 shows the domain speciﬁcation for the shipped
quantities represented by the decision variable family zsm. In Fig. 7.19, the solution
to CWLP is presented.

In order to test this model, we ﬁrst use it to solve the WLP scenario. We assumed
that each supplier (reseller) is able to handle the overall demand from all markets.
Sufﬁciently high quantities of stock have been speciﬁed in the cells C9, C10, and
C11. The returned optimal solution is the same as shown in Fig. 7.7. Only reseller #2
is used and the total costs equal 172,000 €.

7.3 Global Supply Chain Design

179

Fig. 7.19 Returned optimal solution to the CWLP scenario in the PPS case

In the second experiment, we limit the stock size (max. handling quantity for each
reseller) according to the values compiled in Table 7.3. The optimal solution is
shown in Fig. 7.20.
In this case, it is necessary to consider a second reseller since TT Proﬁ is unable to
handle to total annual demand for the six markets. In the new solution, the model
suggests also considering reseller #3. It contributes 100 packages for delivery to
market FRA and fulﬁls the completed UK market demand. The total costs have
increased from 172,000 € to 226,120 €. This is an increase of 54,120 €. The
consideration of the second reseller incurs 70,000 € in costs per year. Furthermore,
the limited handling quantity requires the inclusion of the UK to save the GER
market at increased transportation costs of 120 €, but we can proﬁt from cheaper
transportation costs into the UK which saves 16,000 €. Therefore, we obtain a total
saving of 16,000 €–120 € ¼ 15,880 € in shipment costs, but we have to pay an
additional 70,000 € in annual ﬁxed charges to the second reseller.

Regional Facility Location

The WLP-based approach supports the identiﬁcation of regions that should be
considered for setting up a SC. These regions might be continents, countries, states,
or even farms, growing areas, or plantations supplying or consuming products.
According to the location planning scheme outlined in Sect. 7.2, the outcome of
phase I (the regions to be considered in the prospective SCD) are forwarded into
phase II where one or several locations have to be identiﬁed for each region as
network node.
In the context of the PPS case, the regions are the countries that host the resellers
or the markets. A typical phase II decision is now to select a warehouse to which the
packages are shipped from China and from where customers in the market receive
their deliveries. We can now assume that the regional reseller’s existing facilities are
too small to handle the additional freight ﬂow associated with the celluloid-free balls
and the reseller is looking for a new location in the associated country to build or rent
a new warehouse. This section addresses the particular problem of identifying
promising candidates for establishing a new facility that can handle incoming and
outgoing materials as part of the global SC. In particular, we will

7.4 Regional Facility Location

181

• become familiar with typical phase II decision problems related to location
planning;
• introduce a simple model of center-of-gravity representing a phase II decision
situation;
• develop simple mathematical calculations for the identiﬁcation and determination
of the coordinates of an optimal location;
• consider available demand knowledge while deriving such an optimal location by
solving the so-called Steiner-Weber model;
• learn how the Miehle algorithm can be used to solve the Steiner-Weber model.
We start in Sect. 7.4.1 with the verbal description of the typical phase II decision
problem. Next, in Sect. 7.4.2, we propose a modeling approach for a phase II
decision problem. In Sect. 7.4.3, we discuss a mathematical calculus for the derivation of the optimal solution of the location model.

7.4.1

Management Problem Description

We consider the phase II decision situation of TT Proﬁ, the German reseller selected
by PPS as part of its global SC. TT Proﬁ is looking for a new warehouse in Germany
to receive the inbound material ﬂow from the PPS factory in Shanghai. From this
facility the ﬁve major local retail partners in Germany, shown in Table 7.6, receive
their deliveries.
Each delivery is executed by a small forwarding company which is paid
according to the distance between the pickup point and the delivery point of a
shipment. In order to keep the distribution costs as low as possible, TT Proﬁ wants
to open its new warehouse at a location that leads to the smallest annual transportation distance to be bridged. The chairman of TT Proﬁ wants to know at which
coordinates the new warehouse should be placed to minimize total transportation
costs from the warehouse to all customers.

7.4.2

A Mathematical Model of the Decision Situation

The relevant issues in this decision problem are customer locations, distances from
the warehouse to customers, and customer demands. Each customer location is
represented by the ordered pair of (x;y)-coordinates. The (x;y)-coordinates of the
ﬁve locations are given in the third as well as fourth column of Table 7.6. These data
cannot be modiﬁed; they are input data or problem parameters. The coordinates of
customer i are named (xi;yi), e.g. (x1;y1) ¼ (10;80) and so on. Demand for each
customer is also given and denoted as D(xi;yi).
In contrast, the (x;y)-coordinates (px;py) of the new warehouse are variable and
have to be determined. Consequently, px as well as py are the decision variables in
the investigated decision scenario.
We assume that the total transportation cost sum is proportional to the distance
and the transportation volume (i.e., the demand). This leads us to the formulation of
the objective function, as shown in Eq. (7.19):

We can observe that the total transportation costs depend on the coordinates px
and py of the prospective warehouses and distances. We assume that total transportation cost sum from the prospective warehouse location (px;py) to a customer
location (xi;yi) is more or less equivalent to the distance and demand. Therefore,
the distance d((px;py); (xi;yi)) between the ith customer location and the warehouse
should be determined to calculate transportation costs.
To minimize the payments to the forwarding company, it is necessary to vary px
as well as py as long as Z(px;py) becomes minimal. The minimization of (7.19)
represents the decision situation of identifying the lowest cost facility for TT Proﬁ,
so that it can be understood as a model for the decision situation outlined in Sect.
7.4.1.

7.4.3

Solving the Mathematical Model: Centre-of-Gravity Approach

We call each pair (px;py) that minimizes (7.19) an optimal solution of the model
(7.19). Since there are no further limitations to be considered that restrict the
selection of values of px or py, the decision problem represented by (7.19) falls
into the category of global optimization problems. All possible values of px and py
represent a feasible solution of (7.19) and are therefore candidates to become the
optimal solution.
There are two options for calculating the distances. The ﬁrst option is to use direct
line distance (Euclidean distance) and the second one is the orthographic (square)
distance calculation. According to the ﬁrst option, distance equals the Euclidean
distance between these two points in the plane. This value can be determined
according to Pythagoras’ Theorem leading to Eq. (7.20).

Figure 7.21 depicts the total distance from the warehouse to all customers in
dependence of the warehouse coordinates (px;py) (without demand considerations).
We observe that the function Z shows exactly one minimum; this means there is

183

function value) in dependence

py (all values given in

exactly one pair (px;py) that minimizes Z. Reading the exact values of this optimal
pair is hardly possible. Furthermore, if the number of customers N is quite high then
drawing a similar picture requires huge computational efforts. For these reasons, a
quicker and more reliable method for the determination of the pair of optimal
warehouse coordinates is required.
The function Z is continuous and differentiable and the decision variables are
unrestricted. Hence, we can determine the optimal point of Z by differential calculus.
The following consecutive steps have to be executed in the given order.
1. The ﬁrst derivative Z0 of Z is determined and
2. The zero of Z0 is determined.

(xi;yi) ¼ 1 for all i. Since Z is a function of the two decision variables px as well as py,
the derivative Z0 consists of the two partial derivatives (7.21) and (7.22). They can be
determined by considering py and px respectively as invariant.

Setting the right-hand part of Eq. (7.21) equal to 0 leads to the formula (7.23) and
setting the right-hand side of Eq. (7.22) equal to 0 results in the formula (7.24).
These two formulas (7.23) and (7.24) can be used to determine the optimal values of
the coordinates of the warehouse.
Application of the developed formulas determines the optimal location of the
warehouse for TT Proﬁ. We get the optimal coordinates px ¼ 1045þ60þ4575

8080þ5075þ80
and py ¼
¼ 11. Using these two formulas enables us to derive an

optimal solution of the model (7.19) (without demand considerations) from the
problem parameters provided.
We now incorporate the demand associated with each customer subject in the
model (7.19). This is necessary since a forwarding company is typically paid
according to the bridged distance and quantity moved. The product of distance
(measured in km) and weight (measured in tons) is called the transport performance.
It is expressed in ton kilometers (tkm).
The model (7.19) is called the center-of-gravity model of location analysis
(Chopra and Meindl 2012) or the Steiner-Weber model (Domschke and Drexl
1985). Using demand data, formulas (7.25) and (7.26) are used to calculate optimal
coordinates.

The determination of an optimal pair of coordinates for the warehouse again
requires the determination of the directional derivatives. These two functions are
then set equal to 0 and we get the expressions (7.25) and (7.26), respectively, to
express px and py. Unfortunately, these characterizations of px and py are recursive,
which means that we need px (on the right-hand side of the equation) to calculate px.
The same problem is observed for the determination of py. It is impossible to
transform the two equations so that the recursion is avoided. We cannot determine
the values of (px;py) as we did in the case without demand data. Another approach is
required.

In order to break the circulation in the formulas (7.25) and (7.26), Miehle (1958)
proposes an approximation approach. The basic idea of the Miehle algorithm
comprises the consecutive calculation of a sequence of solutions (a0;b0), (a1;b1),
(a2;b2), . . . of (7.19). The values of (ai1;bi1) are used as px- and py-values in the
right-hand part of the Eqs. (7.25) and (7.26) and they are used to calculate the next
solution (ai;bi). This approach represents an example of a recursive calculation. If we
calculate the coordinate pairs in this way, then the sequence of objective function
values Z(a0;b0), Z(a1;b1), Z(a2;b2), . . . decreases and converges towards the minimal
possible performance value. Therefore, the sequence of calculated coordinates
approximates the optimal pair of coordinates of the new warehouse with respect to
the minimization of the overall required transport performance.
We demonstrate the application of the Miehle algorithm and apply it to the
example data given in Table 7.6. Ignoring customer demand, we can determine a
ﬁrst coordinate pair (a0;b0) by means of the application of the formulas (7.23)–
(7.24), so that we start with (a0;b0) :¼ (1;11). The required performance is Z
(1;11) ¼ 89,738 tkm.
If we set px ¼ a0 ¼ 1 and py ¼ b0 ¼ 11 in the right-hand sides of (7.25) and
(7.26), then we get the updated solution (a1;b1) ¼ (8,78;36,16) with a reduced
required performance value Z(8,78;36,16) ¼ 80,837 tkm. The next iterations are
similarly repeated and an existing solution is replaced by an updated one,
re-applying the formulas (7.25) and (7.26) (see Table 7.7).
Unfortunately, there is no guarantee that the iterative process terminates after a
particular number of repetitions. For this reason, we stop the solution update as soon
as we observe that the original solution (ai;bi) and its update (ai + 1;bi + 1) have
become similar. Here, we call two solutions similar if the distance between the two
represented points is less than 0.05 km. In the TT Proﬁ example, we stop the Miehle
algorithm after ten iterations since the tenth solution proposal (20.50;66.10) and its
update (20.49;66.14) are less than 0.05 km away from each other (column 6 in
Table 7.7). Letting the coordinates for the warehouse be (20.49; 66.14), the total
transportation cost is 751.32 €, subject to (7.19).

Facility Location Planning and Network Design

We have seen in the example application of the Miehle algorithm that the
Z-objective function value decreases after each executed update and the original
point and its update become more and more similar. Now, we summarize the steps of
the Miehle approach:
Start: determine an initial pair of coordinates (a0;b0) by applying (7.21) to
determine a0 and (7.22) for determining b0.
Iteration: as long as the distance between the point (ai;bi) and its update (ai+1;bi+1)
exceeds a given threshold, then start another update cycle. Otherwise return (ai+1;bi+1)
as approximation of the (unknown) optimal solution of the gravity-location model
(7.19).
The evolution of the intermediate solutions during the execution of the Miehle
algorithm is shown in Fig. 7.22. We can observe that the original proposal (the dark
triangle) is far away from the ﬁnal proposal (the diamond). Since Leisure Outlet
requests the largest quantity from TT Proﬁ, it is reasonable to position the warehouse
close to this important customer.
If the customer Rackets & More increases its annual demand quantity to 8 tons,
then it is beneﬁcial to place the new warehouse in the upper left-hand area of the
operations ﬁeld. This shows that the selection of the right warehouse location is

responsive to the demand data. It is therefore very important to take trustworthy and
stable demand estimations to select the right warehouse (see Fig. 7.23).
Note: An Excel ﬁle containing a spreadsheet model of the Miehle approach to the
TT Proﬁ setting can be found in the E-Supplement.

The calculation of distances is shown in Table 7.8.
Subject to Eq. (7.19), total cost is calculated as follows assuming that costs per
kilometer are $1.00:
Z ¼ 55:5  3 þ 55:5  1 þ 129:5  1:5 þ 85:5  3:5 þ 189:5  2 ¼ 1094:5
We can observe that total costs in the second case are higher than the result of the
Miehle algorithm. This can ﬁrst be explained by the larger distances in the square
method compared to the Euclidian distances. Second, we used a simpliﬁed procedure for coordinate calculations without improving them with the Miehle algorithm.
Using the Excel ﬁle in the E-Supplement of this book, you can prove that letting
initial coordinates from Table 7.7 be (7.5;27), then the Miehle algorithm would
provide the same coordinate solution as for the initial case with coordinates
(1;11). Setting these optimal coordinates (20.49;66.14) in (7.19) and using
square distance metrics, calculate total transportation costs and compare this to the
solution with Euclidian distances!
Note: In case of different costs per kilometer in different directions, Eqs. (7.25),
(7.26), (7.28), and (7.29) need to be extended. More speciﬁcally, the numerators and
denominators of the given equations need to be multiplied by the costs for each
individual customer, i.e., in each individual component of the sum functions.

Case-Study OTLG Germany

189

Volkswagen Original Teile Logistik GmbH & Co. KG (OTLG) is a service partner
for spare parts of Volkswagen, Volkswagen Nutzfahrzeuge, Audi, Seat and Škoda.
OTLG is part of the wholesale level in the SC and responsible for sales and
marketing in Germany. At present, OTLG operates in seven locations in Germany.
The company’s annual revenue is almost 2.5 billion euros. It serves almost 5000
partners in Germany and occupies a total warehouse space of more than 300,000m2
(equivalent to 47 football pitches). Annually 45,000,000 materials call-off, pick-up,
and delivery actions take place, corresponding to approximately 200,000 daily
operations.
During the logistics optimization project DNO D (distribution network optimization), OTLG’s distribution network was redesigned. Eleven distribution centers
(DC) were consolidated into eight as shown in Fig. 7.24.
Among them, a new DC VZ Brandenburg in Ludwigsfelde was established (see
Fig. 7.25). The ﬁrst step was to select a location for the new DC. Initially, many
potential locations and selection criteria were identiﬁed, as shown in Fig. 7.26. Next,
a short list of preferable locations was established (Fig. 7.27).
After evaluation, the location Preußenpark was selected because it had the best
scores for the listed criteria. In Fig. 7.28, the new DC is shown.
First, excellent rail and road connections made the selected location preferable.
These criteria are crucial for OTLG because of highly dynamic logistics. Daily,
250 trucks are used for regular supplies and 200 small vans are used for day-to-day
supplies. This ensures that 98% of orders are fulﬁlled within 24 h. The total SKU
number reaches almost 100,000 positions with an inventory value of 43.2 million
euros. Daily, in excess of 30,000 positions are delivered, making it possible to
supply 402 VW/Audi and 476 SEAT/Škoda customers with original spare parts.
Discussion
1. Analyze the redesign of the OTLG distribution network. Which type of logistics
network has been implemented? Why look for a new location in Brandenburg?
2. On the basis of this case study, describe the basic steps in facility selection
decisions! Why were the logistics criteria so important for OTLG? Which criteria
would be important, e.g., for the case of a new hotel?

7.5.2

Factor-Rating Method

Having seen how OTLG GmbH & Co. KG conducted their analysis to identify the
right location for their distribution center, we need to take a deeper look at the related
decision criteria and decision-making procedure. The OTLG case study
demonstrated that the region around Berlin, in combination with excellent

190

infrastructure (road/rail connection), highly inﬂuenced their decision. In other
words, the availability of infrastructure was the factor with the highest priority for
OTLG GmbH & Co. KG.
As you can imagine, not all companies will rate the criterion “infrastructure” as
the most important in selecting a new facility location. This means that different

companies will select different location criteria or location factors which have
different priorities. Therefore, we need to take a closer look at the generic list of
possible plant location criteria.
Location criteria can be divided into quantitative and qualitative areas, as
summarized in Table 7.9.

Practical Insights In practice, the list of location selection criteria is the
first step in facility location planning. On the one hand, this list can
become long very quickly. This is why it is common practice to build
main and sub-groups of criteria to facilitate a clear understanding of the
list structure. On the other hand, many experts from different
departments are involved with setting up this list. It may take quite a
long time to find a compromise on which criteria should be included.

The next step is to evaluate different potential locations according to the deﬁned
factors. The factor-rating method is a very easy. The team in charge of identifying
the new location selects the relevant criteria. As we will see later, this depends on the
industry speciﬁcs, i.e., each company in a certain industry will compose an individual company-centerd list of site location factors.
To make the process very tangible, let’s assume that we are consultants and we
need to support another company like OTLG GmbH & Co. KG in their decisionmaking process. Imagine that in our consulting team, we have compiled the following list with six criteria, as shown in Table 7.10. According to importance, the team
decides the maximum amount of points that can be obtained per location factor. For
the criterion “Infrastructure” this might hypothetically be 300 points, maximal. Then
the team assigns the points for each of the options and per factor.
"

Practical Insights It might be a reasonable to let the team members
make their rating individually and then calculate the averages per factor
and option. The individual score sheets are archived so that the pathway
of decision making is fully transparent and reproducible for later reviews.

For example, if the operations management team consists of ﬁve members and
each individual scores the ﬁrst factor of the ﬁrst option, the resulting scores might
look like this:
Member 1: scores 210
Member 2: scores 230
Member 3: scores 220
Member 4: scores 200
Member 5: scores 205.
On average, this will result in 1065/5 ¼ 213 points for the ﬁrst factor “Infrastructure” for option A. For all other criteria, a similar exercise should be done in practice
so that a completely transparent rating can be presented to senior management.
The option that receives the highest score is the one that is suggested as the most
suitable new location. In our example, this is location B. If the scores of different
options are very close to each other, a sensitivity analysis is mandatory.
Shortcomings of the factor-rating method include the fact that the weighting
percentages assigned per factor are not clearly visible. A useful method for
overcoming this is the so-called utility value analysis.

7.5.3

Utility Value Analysis

We will elaborate the principle approach followed by the utility value analysis (see
Günther and Tempelmeier 2009) in connection with a theoretical case, in which a
global player developed a strategy to produce and distribute its goods in Asia.
Just imagine that the top management of a globally functioning ﬁrm has asked the
SCOM team to look for a suitable location to create a new factory in Asia. The sales
department of that hypothetical global ﬁrm might have assessed that the market for
the ﬁrm’s products is growing signiﬁcantly in, for example, India. As a consequence,
the SCOM team will run an assessment on potential locations there.
The following list provides an overview for ﬁnding a location for a new production facility depending on the different levels of the location decision problem.

7.5 Factor-Ranking Analysis

195

Step 1 Selection of the Economic Region First of all, the respective continent for
the economic region or trade-zone where the search for an appropriate location
should be conducted must be speciﬁed,.
In the ﬁrst step, the following criteria are extremely important:
•
•
•
•

attractiveness of the economic region;
expected sales potential and/or market development;
political stability of the region;
legal requirements regarding the establishment of a production facility, etc.

Step 2 Selection of a Country Within the Economic Region Our theoretical case
also shows that the options need to be further streamlined, i.e., the search for a site
has to be narrowed down (here it is focused on India). This means in the continent of
Asia (Step 1); the sub-continent India has been identiﬁed in Step 2 for the execution
of the location planning and location analysis. Besides the expected market development, there are also such location factors as:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

labor availability;
quality of human resources, for example, education levels;
salary and/or wage levels;
local/regional support for the location of a new facility;
local/regional support regarding business development;
availability of appropriate suppliers;
availability of transport-technology and/or infrastructure which play an
important role.

Step 3 Selection of a Region Within the Country in the Economic Region In the
third step, the sub-continent or maybe country identiﬁed has to be further assessed by
the SCOM team. This means a certain kind of county or district will be identiﬁed for
the placement of the new production facility. In reality, there will most probably be
multiple options available and it will be the task of the experts to identify the best
location for the company. To do this, further criteria have to be taken into consideration; these are be presented next.
When we refer back to our example, the decision-making operations team for the
identiﬁcation of the new facility in India will need to evaluate different alternatives.
This means a long list of alternative sites is drawn up and different options then need
to be critically assessed. This critical assessment has to be reproducible and needs to
be compiled in such a way that the top management can trace back the different steps
that led to the identiﬁcation of the preferred location(s). In practice, a table will be
compiled that shows the different alternatives, which are then mapped and rated
against a deﬁned list of location factors (criteria). This is the fundamental principle of
the utility value analysis. These criteria can be:
• connection to available infrastructure (e.g. roads, rail, ports, airports);
• availability of utilities (such as electricity or water for cooling);

196

7

Facility Location Planning and Network Design

• availability of raw-material (e.g. iron for steel production);
• availability of green-ﬁeld properties or existing objects/facilities;
• subsidies or taxation beneﬁts, etc.
Step 4 Selection of the Facility Location In Step 4, the ﬁnal decision for the
selected location has to be substantiated in case there are multiple possible properties
available on the same pieces of land. Imagine, for example, that there might be a
newly created industrial park where the home community offers different properties
for sale. Therefore, the above mentioned location factor table will provide evidence
for identiﬁcation of the most suitable plot of land for the new facility. Final decision
factors could therefore be:
• geographic dimensioning of the land (either more longitudinal or rectangular or
maybe triangular shape of the property);
• topographic suitability or existing constraints (e.g. hilly grounds or existing
electrical pylons);
• cost of the property and later options for enlargement/expansion;
• opportunities for suppliers to locate nearby;
• environmental constraints (e.g. regarding emissions);
• connection to existing infrastructure (accessibility for inbound ﬂows and also
shipment of ﬁnished goods outbound).
The principle sequence of the activities that need to be performed by the SCOM
team to conduct such a utility value analysis is as follows:
1.
2.
3.
4.

Identify location options.
Determine decision criteria (location factors) and their measurement.
Determine weighting totalling 100% for the different criteria.
Evaluate every location option on a normalized scale to achieve “partial utility
values” with a scale from 1 to 10 points (in which 10 ¼ best).
5. Calculate the “total utility value” of a location option by multiplying “partial
utility values” with weights and adding these values.
6. Choose the option with the highest “total utility value”.
Table 7.11 depicts a simpliﬁed example of the potential application of the utility
value analysis.
The possible location factors presented above are respective indications of
inspirations for the SCOM team. In practice, the location criteria will be different
depending on the respective industry and will have different priorities. For example,
for a chemical company, ecological restrictions are extremely important and for
heavy industry the availability of required resources will most probably have a
signiﬁcant inﬂuence on the decision-making process. Also factors such as the
company’s other existing facilities in the given region might inﬂuence the decision
about a new site.

Practical Insights Facility location planning decisions imply the usage of
both quantitative and qualitative methods. Despite rigor and technical
power, simulation and optimization methods are not the dominant
techniques in decision-making on facility location planning and SCD. In
practice, these decisions are typically driven by corporate policies and
are analyzed with the help of business cases and empirical data.

Case Study “Niedersachsen Park” (Based on www.niedersachsenpark.de)
The objective of this case study is to ﬁnd out why the Adidas Group selected the
Niedersachsenpark as a location for its new distribution center. The Adidas Group is
the world’s second-biggest sports goods manufacturer and is headquartered in
Herzogenaurach, Germany. In Germany, the Adidas Group has three distribution
centers. Two of them are in the area of the group’s headquarter in Bavaria and the
third one, which opened in 2013, is located in Niedersachsenpark, the largest
industrial and commercial area in Lower Saxony. This newly established distribution
center is the group’s largest in terms of throughput. In 2015, the Adidas Group
expects a throughput of 100 million pieces per year at this distribution center. In
comparison, the two distribution centers in Bavaria (in Uffenheim and Scheinfeld)
together achieve a total throughput of 80 million pieces.
Besides the expected throughput, the new distribution center in the Niedersachsenpark has further advantages such as its location. In contrast to the locations
in Bavaria, this one is directly located on highway A1 and the main harbors are easily
accessible from this location. This is extremely important for the Adidas Group as
the main components of its products arrive in Germany by sea (Hamburg, Bremen,
Bremerhaven). Therefore, the group can decrease transportation costs from the
harbors to the distribution centers. Furthermore, since Niedersachsenpark is a
newly established industrial and commercial park, it was highly ﬂexible in terms
of construction and development plans for fulﬁlling the Adidas Group’s
requirements.

Additionally, the construction rights for the whole area are regulated. There was
no possibility of public disputes that might cause long waiting times or potential
reputation damages before they started operating at this location. Since there are no
residential areas in the immediate vicinity of Niedersachsenpark, the distribution
center is allowed to operate 24/7, as opposed to 17 h per day in Uffenheim and
Scheinfeld. This allows for highly efﬁcient processes at Niedersachsenpark. Another
signiﬁcant advantage of Niedersachsenpark was the chance to reserve areas for
potential future expansion. Companies can reserve these areas in case they do not
want to exclude possible future expansion, but as yet do not have any concrete plans.
This advantage creates a valuable degree of ﬂexibility for the organizations located
in Niedersachsenpark.
To sum up, the advantages outlined indicate that Niedersachsenpark was a
favorable location for the Adidas Group’s new distribution center. In many aspects,
it surpasses the distribution centers in Bavaria. According to Lars Mangels (Corporate Communication Manager at Adidas Group), Niedersachsenpark meets all the
requirements that they expect from a location for a distribution center.
The case study reveals that Niedersachsenpark is the optimal location for the
Adidas Group’s new distribution center. Do you agree? Apply the factor-rating and
utility value analysis methods to this case (N-Park ¼ Niedersachsenpark; Bavaria ¼
Uffenheim&Scheinfeld) (use Table 7.12).

Combining Optimization and Simulation in Supply Chain
Design

Consider a combination of simulation and optimization that seeks to ﬁnd optimal
locations for facilities and allocate customers to those locations subject to supply
chain proﬁt maximization (i.e., we consider location-allocation problems). Figure
7.29 depicts major interdependencies between the parameters in supply chain
design.

Fig. 7.29 Supply chain design analysis framework

Network optimization can be used for a number of supply chain design problems
such as:
• Incapacitated and capacitated plant location problem;
• Distribution network design;
• Distribution network design with inventory, lead time, and transportation mode
selection;
• Production-distribution network design;
• Hub location problem;
• Supply network design with operational risks;
• Supply network design with disruption risks.
In a generalized form, supply chain design using network optimization considers
such parameters as
•
•
•
•
•

Alternative facility locations,
Customers (markets),
Production, inventory processing, and transportation costs,
Fixed facility costs and inventory holding costs,
Minimum and maximum throughputs and capacities in production, transportation, and storage,
• Demand in the markets,
• Number of periods and products,
• Bill of materials.

Facility Location Planning and Network Design

The variables to be optimized are facilities to be included in the supply chain
design and quantities (ﬂows) to be delivered from sources to destinations in the
supply chain. The solutions are usually constrained by maximum/minimum demand
in the markets and minimum and maximum throughputs and capacities in production, transportation, and storage. The objective function minimizes total costs.
Even though network optimization can lead to useful insights, some dynamic
issues, such as inventory, sourcing, and shipment control policies are not considered
within this framework of analysis. As such, simulation can be a useful extension of a
network optimization, because it enables consideration of time-dependent
uncertainties, such as demand and lead-time ﬂuctuations (i.e., operational risks)
and facility breakdowns (i.e., disruption risks). Moreover, simulation can be used
to validate optimization results in dynamic and uncertain environments (cf. Chap. 3).

Key Points

This chapter introduced the problems, models, and techniques for managing location
decisions in the context of a supply network setup. We received insights into location
analysis processes and understand the importance of selecting the right location for
facilities during the formation of a supply network. There are several different
important decision tasks to be solved before the network can be set up. We have
introduced an SCD framework for aligning these decisions. Finally, we have become
familiar with the tools for supporting SCD decisions. The selection of an approach
mainly depends on the problem data we want to consider for obtaining optimal
decisions.
Section 7.3 provided an introduction into an important decision problem of
location planning. The WLP addresses the challenge of researching markets and
suppliers and forging transportation links between markets and suppliers from a
longer term perspective. The goal of warehouse location planning is the minimization of the total costs for SCD. With the help of the PPS example, we analyzed a
typical WLP setting as well as the relevant planning data.
We investigated a model-based approach to identify the best SCD. First, we
proposed a mathematical optimization model for the WLP. Second, we conﬁgured
and applied a spreadsheet decision support tool using the Excel Solver add-in. Third,
we learned the technique of branch-&-bound as a general approach for deriving
optimal design options for the WLP model. Finally, we analyzed the impacts of
limited product availability at certain suppliers for the SCD and introduced the
CWLP model for which we conﬁgured a spreadsheet-based tool to derive optimal
solutions.
It can be concluded that mathematical programing techniques are useful and
powerful tools for improving decisions for SCD. They allow for consideration of
demand, capacity, and costs while determining global SCD. At the same time, the
application of these tools in real life should be considered subject to numerous
limitations, such as assumptions on linear functions, deterministic parameter values,
and computational complexity. A solution to the mathematical model is not

Bibliography

automatically a managerial decision! Up-to-date research trends are involved in
consideration of non-deterministic parameters (Lim et al. 2013), reliable SCD
(Snyder and Daskin 2005; Klibi et al. 2010; Li et al. 2013), and the ripple-effect in
SCs (Ivanov et al. 2014).
Section 7.4 considered the next stage in SCD, where all regions are processed
individually. In each region, speciﬁc locations (expressed by coordinates) are
identiﬁed at which a facility can be installed or from which supply quantities can
inﬁltrate the SC. The output of this phase is suggestions for locations for opening
facilities with regard to cost efﬁciency. We learned how to apply the center-ofgravity method to facility location decisions and how to determine optimal location,
coordinated with the help of a simple average method and the Miehle algorithm. The
center-of-gravity method can help determine the location of one warehouse subject
to minimal transportation costs. It is a simple method which is easy to implement.
The shortcomings are linear assumptions, impossibility of considering multiple
locations, deterministic data, and poor consideration of geographic and real road
infrastructure.
In Sect. 7.5, multiple criteria analysis was considered reaching beyond cost
minimization. We learned factor-rating and utility value analysis methods, and
their advantages and limitations in practice. Factor rating and utility value analysis
methods allow for consideration of different qualitative and quantitative factors for
location decisions which are easily understood by managers. Some shortcomings are
the subjectivity of these methods regarding the selection of factors and their scoring
and weighting. Sensitivity analysis is important for practical application of factor
rating and utility value analysis methods.
Recall Chap. 4, Supply Chain Strategy, and analyze the PPS case with regard to
the following:
• Discuss the SC strategy of PPS with respect to Europe and the celluloid-free table
tennis balls. What is the market to be served? Is there a reactive strategy preferred
or is there a push strategy intended?
• What are the limitations given to Mr. Chen for the setup of the SCD in Europe?
• Assume that PPS wants to offer a 72 h delivery time to all customers in Europe
when they order a packaging unit via a retail website. Discuss whether the SCD as
intended by Mr. Chen can be used again or whether signiﬁcant redesign efforts
are required.

8.1

Introductory Case Study: Bavarian Wood

Bavarian Wood is a manufacturer of high quality furniture. The product portfolio is
mainly comprised of all types of furniture made from natural wood. A typical
customer of Bavarian Wood is willing to pay quite a high price in order to get a
fairly high quality product. Figure 8.1 depicts the supply network for Bavarian
Wood.

Since wood is the main material of Bavarian Wood products, the procurement of
different kinds of wood is critical to the performance and success of Bavarian Wood
operations. A large amount of the wood is bought from Asian suppliers. After having
seen the trees, deputies from Bavarian Wood’s procurement department select those
trees that will be used as raw material “suppliers”. Local farm workers chop the trees,
clean them roughly and load them in containers. These containers are forwarded to
the nearest container port from where they are shipped directly or with transshipments from different carriers to the container ports of Hamburg, Bremerhaven,
or Wilhelmshaven in northern Germany. Due to weather conditions in the Asian
supply regions and the incorporation of different container vessel lines, it is impossible to even out and balance the quantity of containers bringing supplies for
Bavarian Wood.
After a container for Bavarian Wood has arrived in one of the three container
terminals, a wood expert inspects the raw material and sometimes rejects a container
due to low quality or vermin infestation. After a container load has passed quality

control, the wood is transshipped on hired trucks, which bring it to the Bavarian
Wood manufacturing site close to Munich, approximately 800 km away from the
coast (see Fig. 8.1).
Bavarian Wood was founded in 1875, and has since grown continuously with
stable economic success. However, during the economic crisis between 2008 and
2010, Bavarian Wood was in danger of becoming bankrupt. It was able to survive
only with the help of additional investments. Recently, the new stakeholders have
been analyzing and evaluating all of Bavarian Wood’s processes in order to protect
their investments and achieve long-term proﬁtability. These evaluations are executed
by external consultants. In their ﬁnal evaluation report, they mentioned that transportation costs for the raw materials are quite high. They recognize that the imported
wood is not available in Europe so the international procurement strategy is necessary, but they recommend reconsidering the process of bringing the imported wood
from the ports in northern Germany to the manufacturing site in Bavaria.
Having received the evaluation reports from the stakeholders, the management
board of Bavarian Wood discusses the implications. Regarding the “transportation
problem”, they admit that they do not have enough logistical knowledge to assess
and potentially restructure the transportation processes. They discuss the situation
with stakeholder representatives and get the OK to extend the management board
with another member, who will be in charge of the transportation and logistics
processes. After a careful application and candidate selection procedure, Bavarian
Wood hires Mike as the transportation and logistics manager. Mike has worked for
several years as a transport consulting engineer and on several development and
restructuring projects for national and international transport networks.
His ﬁrst duty with Bavarian Wood is to check the current setup of the transportation process system between the ports and the manufacturing site of Bavarian
Woods.
(a) Mike discovers that Bavarian Wood does not possess its own trucks. Whenever
a certain transport quantity has to be moved, Bavarian Wood hires a truck from
a freight forwarding company at a ﬁxed daily rate. Is this a good idea? Please
discuss the pros and cons of this setup.
Having managed the critical years, Bavarian Wood wants to start growing again.
Currently, they are preparing the integration of two other furniture factories into their
company. One of these production facilities is located close to Prague, capital of the
Czech Republic. The second additional production site is in Austria, close to
Salzburg, directly beside the Austrian-German border. After the integration of
these two additional production sites has been completed, imported quantities of
wood will increase by approximately 150%. To ensure the availability of sufﬁcient
quantities of wood, imports will also be processed via the Dutch port of Rotterdam.
(b) Should the previous method of transport be retained? What are the possible
modiﬁcations required for hinterland transportation? Should Bavarian Wood
buy its own trucks and set up its own transport department? Which production
site should be supplied from which port in order to keep transportation costs to a

206

minimum? Should all necessary transport services be given away to a transport
service provider?

8.2

Generic Transport Network Structures

Mike prepares a short summary about the generic transport network structures from
the perspective of the so-called origin-to-destination (OD) demand. The OD demand
expresses the need to move a given quantity of goods from a location of supply (the
origin) to a location of demand (the destination).
In the simplest setup, the supply quantities are available at a single location (the
origin) and the available supply quantity is requested completely or partially from a
single location (the destination) as outlined in Fig. 8.2. There is no opportunity to
optimize (reduce) the transportation efforts if the destination wants to receive the
requested quantity immediately. If a split delivery is allowed, then it is possible to
divide the total quantity into smaller shipments which can be picked up and
delivered one after another. Time of delivery of individual shipments can be
arranged.
Decisions about the distribution network setup outlined in Fig. 8.3 are the same as
in the link setup described previously. Only the time of delivery can be decided.
In Fig. 8.4, the destination requests a certain supply quantity, but the demand
quantity is distributed over several origin locations. In general, the total available
quantity exceeds the quantity demanded. Besides responding to the question of when
to deliver, another important decision must be made. It is necessary to decide which
origin should provide which supply quantity. It is important to take care that the
cheapest transportation links are used. However, if the relevant origin does not offer

sufﬁcient quantities, it is necessary to use a second (and maybe further) transportation links in order to satisfy demand from the destination. From the perspective of the
location planning framework introduced in Chap. 7, answering the question as to
which supply location contributes which quantity to fulﬁl the total demand would be
a fourth phase decision: this is called the capacity allocation decision.
The most complex situation is represented by the many-to-many network structure shown in Fig. 8.5. Here, several origins provide supply quantities, but there are
also several demanding destination locations. Beside decisions about delivery times,
it is necessary to make two additional decisions. First, it is necessary to decide from
which location(s) an individual destination location is supplied. Second, for each
origin location there is a decision required about the quantities and destinations that
are supplied. Finally, the decision becomes even more complex if the costs for
moving goods along the available transportation links are different.
Mike concludes his introduction into generic transportation network structures by
applying the new vocabulary to the Bavarian Wood case. Currently, there is a supply
network structure available with the three ports, Wilhelmshaven, Bremerhaven, and
Hamburg, forming the set of origins and a single destination in Munich. However, as

208

Distribution and Transportation Network Design

soon as the second manufacturing facility (either in the Czech Republic or in
Austria) is integrated into the wood supply network, the network type changes to a
many-to-many network structure.
"

Practical Insights New Big Data-driven marketing strategies influence
distribution network design. One example is omnichannel strategy.
Omnichannel is the cross-channel business model to increase the
customer’s experience by organizing promotions on-site, using social
networks, apps, and other channels. This diversity increases demand
unpredictability and distribution network coordination complexity.

8.3

Realizing Economies of Scale in Transportation

Walter, who is Bavarian Wood’s ﬁnance ofﬁcer, is very interested in Mike’s
statements. He is the ﬁrst one to ask Mike a question. He wants to know how
money can be saved in the transportation business and how the efﬁciency of the
process can be improved. From his daily business, he knows that economies of scale
are typically realized if large quantities of a product are bought or if unnecessary
setups of machines can be avoided. Walter wants to know from Mike if there are
similar principles that can be exploited in transportation.
Mike is happy about this question since it offers an entry point for his
explanations about how money can be saved through sophisticatedly organized
transportation systems and elaborated transportation processes. Walter asks: “What
is the general logic behind reducing costs in transportation? What are the general
issues to be considered here for a “good transportation” system conﬁguration?”

8.3.1

Consolidation of Shipments

Mike wants to hire trucks from a trucking company to carry out the necessary
transportation services between Hamburg and Munich, since Bavarian Wood does
not run its own trucks. After a telephone call to an old friend in the forwarding
company TransRoad, he receives an offer for forwarding services. According to the
offer, the provision of a truck costs 850 € per day including all mileage and the costs
for the driver, insurances, etc. The truck provides a payload of at most 25 tons and
the aforementioned amount is due independently from the actual loaded weight. If
Mike wants to ship more than 25 tons a day, he is obliged to hire and pay for a
second truck. The rental conditions for the second and a conditional third truck are
identical to the conditions already outlined.
An evaluation of this offer reveals the following interesting cost structures and
properties. If a truck is hired for the ﬁrst ton payload, then the remaining 24 tons can
be transported without any additional costs. This means that the proposed tariff

8.3 Realizing Economies of Scale in Transportation

209

Fig. 8.6 Piece-wise constant function of the total transportation costs for given payload quantity

contains a “bounded ﬂat rate” up to 25 tons (see Fig. 8.6). The continuous line
represents the costs if one truck is hired, the dotted line represents the situation with
two hired trucks, and the dashed line applies to the costs if the payload is so high that
a third trucks must be hired. There are discontinuities of the total costs whenever
another truck is needed.
Some conclusions can be formulated after some basic variable name conventions
have been introduced. Let F be the price for hiring a truck and
l mQ be the payload of
the hired truck. Let dR be the corresponding OD demand for dQR the considered OD
relation R. The number of required trucks N(R; Q) equals then and the total
transportation costs for this relation R sum up to C(R; Q; F) :¼ F  N(R; Q).
If the costs for the truck are equally split over the complete payload assigned to
this truck, then the average costs per ton decrease with increasing payload as long as
the total payload does not exceed 25 tons (the payload capacity provided by the
truck). The carriage of 1 ton leads to a cost factor of 850 € per ton, while the carriage
of 10 tons reduces this to 85 € per ton (Fig. 8.7). If the payload exceeds 25 tons it
becomes necessary to hire an additional truck which causes a discontinuity in the
total costs C leading to an implied increase in the costs c(dR;F;Q) per ton payload.
"

Practical Insights Transportation costs typically comprise 6–8% of the
company’s costs. In most cases, transportation costs can be reduced by
10–15%. For example, a company with total costs of 1.0 billion euros can
cut transport costs by around 8.0 million euros.

Mike concludes from the aforementioned facts that he should attempt to ﬁll a
hired truck completely to minimize the costs per moved ton of payload. Furthermore,
a potentially necessary second truck should also be ﬁlled as much as possible to
reduce transportation costs.

Consolidation is the term for the combination of two or even more quantities to be
shipped between a given origin and a given destination. Mike thinks about ways to
consolidate several quantities to ﬁll up a partially ﬁlled truck. In the selected week
shown in Table 8.1, Mike detects that the stated demand for Monday (the production
output from the concrete factory) is 32 tons so that two trucks are needed to carry the
complete production output to Munich. This results in total truck hiring costs of
1700 € which leads to 1700 €/32 tons ¼ 53.13 €/ton costs for each carried ton, but the
average ﬁll rate is only 64%. The immediate transport of the total quantity without
the postponement of any quantities requires hiring 15 trucks, so that the weekly
transportation costs account for 15  850 € ¼ 12,750 € at an average ﬁll rate of
71.5%.

8.3.2

Postponement

Analyzing the daily transport demand for a week as shown in Table 8.1, Mike comes
up with the idea of postponing the transfer of a fraction of the daily transportation
demand to avoid the inclusion of a truck that is only partially ﬁlled. Mike knows that

there is no urgency related to the shipment of demand as long as at least one truck
travels from Hamburg to Munich each day. His idea is now to send out only
completely ﬁlled trucks (except on Sunday when the residual quantity of the weekly
demand must be moved to Munich).
Table 8.2 shows the resulting transport activities. The incoming demand is
merged with postponed quantities to the recent available demand. Full truck loads
(FTL) are derived from the available demand quantities, but residual quantities are
postponed until a later day of the week. This strategy results in completely ﬁlled
trucks Monday to Saturday, but on Sunday the average ﬁll rate falls to 90%.
However, only 11 trucks are needed costing 9350 €, representing a saving of
transportation costs of 26.67% and an average capacity utilization rate greater than
98%.
Mike is very surprised how much money he can save if he uses the postponement
strategy with the goal of sending out only fully loaded trucks in order to realize the
largest possible economies of scale. However, Mike is aware that this postponement
strategy is fragile. In the event that the demanding construction site requests immediate transportation of the produced quantities, this strategy can no longer be applied.
Therefore, Mike will look for other opportunities to increase the ﬁll rate of the hired
trucks.

8.3.3

Milk-Runs

Mike analyzes the daily supply quantities from the three ports of Hamburg,
Bremerhaven and Wilhelmshaven, all located close together in northern Germany.
Currently, Bavarian Wood hires trucks for all three links, Hamburg-Munich,
Bremerhaven-Munich, and Wilhelmshaven-Munich. Each of these trucks picks up
the assigned payload quantity at the selected port and brings it directly to the Munich
area. For the example week given in Table 8.3, this approach leads to a total of
36 hired trucks. The costs to be paid to the forwarding companies add up to 30,600 €.
Average capacity utilizations between 61% and 79% are observed, and the average
costs per moved ton vary between 44.89 € and 60.43 €.

A ﬁrst analysis of the data from Table 8.3 reveals that only 17 of the 36 hired
trucks are fully loaded. More than half of the hired trucks are operated with only a
partial load. In addition, the quantities carried by the partially loaded trucks are often
quite small. Mike analyzes the situation on Thursday. From Hamburg, the second
hired truck carries only 9 tons. The second truck hired for the Bremerhaven to
Munich service picks up only 3 tons while the only truck going from Wilhelmshaven
loads only 13 tons. Mike recognizes that these three “excess” quantities add up to
25 tons so that one truck could move all three shipments. For this reason, Mike
decides to evaluate a so-called milk-run service (Chopra and Meindl 2009) from the
ports to Munich. In a milk-run, one truck visits two or more pickup locations before
bringing the whole load to a common destination.
In the Bavarian Wood setup, there are four different milk-runs possible: (1) Hamburg, Bremerhaven and Wilhelmshaven are served as pickup locations by the same
truck; (2) Hamburg and Bremerhaven are served in one milk-run; (3) demand
quantities waiting in Hamburg as well as in Wilhelmshaven are consolidated;
(4) one truck loads demand quantities in Bremerhaven as well as in Wilhelmshaven.
The visiting sequence depends on the initial position of the truck as well as on the

8.3 Realizing Economies of Scale in Transportation

213

pickup locations and the common drop-off location (see Chap. 14). Milk-runs
represent the location-based consolidation of shipments.
In order to achieve the largest cost reduction possible with milk-runs, Mike
employs the following approach. He starts determining the minimal number of
fully loaded trucks for each day and port. As an example, Mike considers Monday.
Hamburg expresses a demand of 32 tons, so that one full truck load of 25 tons can be
achieved. Mike puts the remaining 7 tons in the “milk-run quantity”. From
Bremerhaven, 23 tons must be carried away, but no full truck load can be generated
so Mike puts all 23 tons into the milk-run quantity. From Wilhelmshaven, Mike puts
13 tons into the milk-run quantity. Overall, 43 tons were selected for a milk-run
service.
One option (Table 8.4) is to hire two trucks for milk-runs. The ﬁrst truck among
them starts in Hamburg, picking up 7 tons. It proceeds to Bremerhaven where it
loads an additional 13 tons; next it continues to Wilhelmshaven where 5 tons are
picked up. The second hired milk-run truck starts in Bremerhaven and loads
10 trucks and, additionally, picks up 8 tons in Wilhelmshaven. The incorporation
of the milk-run services needs two trucks instead of three if no milk-run is used, so
that one truck is saved on Monday. Similarly, Mike compiles milk-runs for the
remaining days (see Table 8.4). The daily saving of trucks for hire ﬁnally leads to a
reduction of trucks required to 28 (compared to 36 trucks without milk-runs). This
implies a reduction of hiring costs by 22.2% down to 23,800 €. The average capacity
utilization rate climbs up to 92% and the average costs for moving a 1-ton payload
falls to 37.38 € when milk-run operations are performed.

8.3.4

Transshipment

Mike has explained the beneﬁts of the milk-run services. However, he also mentions
the shortcomings and deﬁciencies. The major challenge is to ensure that the milk-run
services ﬁt daily demand. From day to day, the milk-runs have to be adapted to
recent demand. This makes milk-run planning quite complicated. If the total
quantities from the milk-run locations are slightly above the full truck load quantity,
then the incorporation of an almost empty truck cannot be avoided. Furthermore, in
the case of the prospective inclusion of the port of Rotterdam as well as the two
manufacturing sites in Austria and the Czech Republic, milk-runs seem to become
less attractive due to the long distances involved. Because of these challenges, Mike
proposes a third consolidation approach to the management board of
Bavarian Wood.
As can be observed from the left-hand map in Fig. 8.8, a major part of the three
truck routes from the sea ports to the production site is the same. All three pickup
locations Wilhelmshaven, Bremerhaven, and Hamburg “share” a large part of their
connection path to their common destination, Munich. To increase the ﬁll rate of
trucks travelling long distances, Mike proposes installing a transshipment facility in
Hanover, where trucks coming from the three seaports enter the same major northto-south motorway, A7. In this transshipment facility, the inbound trucks are

unloaded and sent back to the ports in order to bring further quantities to the facility.
Other trucks are then loaded with the quantities recently arrived, and these trucks
then travel to Munich (Fig. 8.9).
Mike outlines two major beneﬁts of this type of shipment consolidation. First, the
trucks travelling from the ports to the transshipment facility travel relatively short
distances, between 150 and 200 km. Therefore, they can shuttle two or even three
times between their pickup port and Hanover, so a single truck is enough to forward
all quantities from the port to the transshipment facility in the port hinterland.
Second, due to the consolidation of the inbound ﬂow of quantities originating
from the three sea ports, there are huge opportunities to compile full truck loads
for the main-haul service between Hanover and Munich. Both aspects contribute to
the reduction of transportation costs.
Mike explains the idea of transshipment-based consolidation according to the
following set-up. A hired truck is available and paid for 24 h. Within this period, it
can execute three feeder cycles between a port and the transshipment facility and a
subsequent main-haul trip from Hanover to Munich (type-A service pattern). Alternatively, it can complete six feeder cycles and no main-haul trip (type-B service
pattern); or, as the third option, it can execute one main-haul trip only (type-C service
pattern). A truck that is operated only in the feeder service in northern Germany can
be hired for a reduced tariff of 750 €, since the truck operator incurs fewer costs for
overnight stays for the vehicle and crew. The reduced tariff of 700 € applies to a
truck executing one main haul only due to reduced travel distances, as in the type-Cpattern. In the ﬁrst two consolidation approaches (postponement and milk-runs),

Geobasis-DE/BKG (# 2009), Google, Mapa GISrael, ORION-ME, basado en BCN IGN Espana)

Mike was unable to exploit the reduced tariffs since each hired truck was assigned to
a long haul operation. The separation of feeder operations from main-haul operations
results in the possibility of agreeing on different tariffs for trucks assigned to
different service patterns.
Table 8.5 and model [Eqs. (8.1)–(8.4)] contain calculations for the number of
trucks needed as well as the associated costs. Determining the least cost number of
trucks operating type-A, type-B, or type-C patterns per day is an optimization
problem with constraints. The least cost number of hired trucks for the three patterns
should be found, but it must also be ensured that the minimal number of required
feeder cycles and main-haul services are provided. However, this problem can be
modeled as an integer linear program as follows. Let yA be the integer decision
variable representing the number of trucks hired for executing a type-A service
pattern. For the number of hired type-B pattern trucks and type-C pattern trucks, the

must be respected. Only complete trucks can be hired [Eq. (8.4)]. This model can
easily be solved using Excel Solver or any other solver software.
Mike has determined the best number of trucks as shown in Table 8.5. The
incorporation of trucks assigned to main-hauls only (type-C pattern) realizes costs
reductions of more than 6% compared to the milk-run situation although the number
of incorporated trucks remains the same.
Although the transshipment strategy requires the least weekly transportation costs
if no postponement is possible, Mike is aware of some shortcomings. First, the
transshipment facility must be constructed, hired, or rented. The transshipment
activities and the necessary storage processes incur costs. As long as the additional
costs are less than the transportation costs savings, Mike suggests using a
transshipment facility. However, Mike also warns managers that the complexity of
the transport network conﬁguration would increase.
So far, Mike has introduced the concept of shipment consolidation as a strategy to
avoid partially ﬁlled truck trips. The intention of consolidation is to achieve
economies of scale during transportation. Three consolidation strategies have been
proposed. Postponement compiles shipments from different time slots together.
Milk-runs aim to load shipments from different pickup operations on one truck in
order to lift the ﬁll rate of this truck. Transshipment exploits different hiring tariffs
for different kinds of truck operations (depending on regional services).
Mike concludes that the ideas presented here apply in general also for other
means of transport like trains, plans, vessels, or barges. In case of transshipment
consolidation, feeder services as well as main-haul operations can be assigned to
resources from different means of transport (see Sect. 8.6).

8.4

Trade-Off-Based Transportation Network Design

After Mike ﬁnished his presentation, a discussion is initiated about the right distribution network strategy for Bavarian Wood. The board members like the idea of
redesigning the supply network based on transshipment. However, they do not feel
comfortable with the necessary investment nor with the annual costs for running a
transshipment point. With respect to the prospective extension by the inclusion of
Rotterdam, Salzburg, and Prague, they cannot estimate the associated costs and
beneﬁts. Therefore, they ask Mike to deliver further explanations about this issue.
Mike expected such a question. He has prepared an executive summary of the
section “Factors Inﬂuencing Distribution Network Design” from Chopra and
Meindl’s (2009) SCM book, where the aforementioned topic is discussed in detail.
He distributes these copies and provides an oral survey.
There are two general directions for designing and evaluating transportation
networks. First, customer needs must be identiﬁed. These needs will be the starting
point for the setup of the transportation network. Second, the costs of the installation
and deployment of the transportation network have to be determined. Both of these
are compromised by the uncertainty of future circumstances under which the
transport network is used. On the one hand, customer needs are unknown, hidden,

8.4 Trade-Off-Based Transportation Network Design

219

or will change. On the other hand, the costs for running a certain network are subject
to external impacts, possibly from oscillating customer demand, varying fuel prices,
labor costs, and so on. Therefore, only a rough estimation of beneﬁts with regard to
customer satisfaction and costs is possible.
The major driver of customer satisfaction is the ability to react immediately and
with high reliability to an expressed customer demand. If a customer recognizes the
need for transportation, this customer wants to have the services as soon as possible.
Here, the urgency is related to either the quickest possible pickup time or the earliest
delivery time. With respect to the Bavarian Wood situation, the following might occur.
A manufacturing site (Munich, Salzburg, or Prague) recognizes that additional material is needed as soon as possible. If the material is stocked (even for a short time, but
regularly) in one of the import or transshipment facilities contained in the Bavarian
Wood supply network, the average re-supply time tends to decrease with the increasing number of network nodes. Depending on the spatial distribution of the nodes
where materials are stocked, the re-supply time (which equals the difference between
the time of arrival of the additional material and the time when the need is expressed)
decreases proportionally, degressively or progressively (see Fig. 8.10).
Figure 8.10 clearly shows that there is a strong relationship between the number
of facilities for storing supply materials and the customer service level. In the
Bavarian Wood case, each transshipment point will hold some quantities of different
types of wood which is in transit from the import ports in Germany and (prospectively) in the Netherlands to the manufacturing sites. Mike emphasizes that storing
even small quantities in a transshipment yard can contribute to ensuring a quick
re-supply. The major reason for this is that the reduced distance from a transshipment
yard to the factories compared to the average distance from the seaport to the
manufacturing sites. However, Mike also explains that the number of facilities
play a higher role in the distribution of goods with late customer orders.

required to ensure this response time

220

Distribution and Transportation Network Design

To achieve a higher level of material availability and a quicker re-supply time,
Mike proposes discussing the installation of two transshipment points. Besides the one
in Hanover, he proposes establishing a transshipment facility in the region of
Wuerzburg, which lies just between Hanover and Munich, close to the major motorway A7. In this transshipment facility, the inbound ﬂow of wood from the German
seaport can be merged with the inbound ﬂow from Rotterdam. Furthermore, from the
Wuerzburg facility, it is possible to send materials to all three manufacturing sites. A
small warehouse here can be used to maintain a centralized safety stock of all material
for all three production sites at each transshipment yard. Of course, costs for keeping
all facilities running increases if the number of operated facilities is increased.
After Mike has clariﬁed the interrelations between the number of considered
network nodes and the service to be offered to the customer, he continues to explain
the main cost drivers in a transportation network. Mike points out that there are three
major cost drivers to be considered during the determination of the right network
design (Fig. 8.11). First, there are inventory costs. Inventory costs tend to grow if the
number of networked facilities is increased because each facility holds a certain
quantity of inventory. Besides the fact that there is planned inventory already
stocked, there might also be inventory just waiting to be forwarded. Second, the
costs directly associated with the usage of the facilities have to be considered: costs
increase if the number of facilities is increased. Third, there are the transportation
costs that contribute to the overall expenditures.
In Fig. 8.11, the typical development of the transportation costs is represented by
the dashed-dotted graph. Up to a certain number of maintained transshipment
facilities, additional economies of scale can be realized by consolidation, as
discussed in Sect. 8.3. If more transshipment facilities are incorporated into the

Fig. 8.11 Relation between desired customer response time (x-axis) and the number of facilities
required to ensure this response time

8.5 Capacity Allocation in a Many-to-Many Network

221

network, then the number of transport connections exceeds a threshold value.
Beyond this threshold value, it is no longer possible to completely ﬁll a truck. The
average quantity to be moved by a truck decreases, since total transport demand is
distributed over a higher number of transport options, so that the costs per moved ton
increase further. Totalling two increasing cost functions for facility and inventory
costs and of the convex transportation cost function leads to a convex function for
the total costs. Such a function has an optimal number of facilities with minimal total
costs. Incorporating this optimal number of facilities minimizes the total costs of the
transportation system and thus contributes to balancing costs and customer
satisfaction.

8.5

Capacity Allocation in a Many-to-Many Network

After Mike has completed the outline of the scheme to ﬁnd the appropriate transportation network, another discussion among the board members of Bavarian Wood is
initiated. Robert, who is the human resource manager, wants to know if it is possible
to establish and operate a highly sophisticated transportation network without welltrained and educated staff members. Mike is sure that this is impossible since
transportation management requires in-depth knowledge about transport
technologies, transport processes, and transport regulations and laws.
This clear statement is considered by the board members in the subsequent
discussions. Since it seems impossible to operate a complex transportation network
efﬁciently without a well-trained group of transportation managers, there are two
options left: either a well-trained highly specialized group of transportation
managers must be established (hired or trained); or transportation activities must
be outsourced.
Robert wants to know Mike’s opinion. Mike replies as follows. So far, Bavarian
Wood has followed a strategy somewhere in between the two options. Since
Bavarian Wood has no trucks of its own, these vehicles are hired. However, the
risk of failing to achieve the required high ﬁll rate to gain economies of scale is
completely with Bavarian Wood. If no economies of scale can be realized for any
reason, the transportation costs will be quite high, as seen in the examples in Sect.
8.3. For this reason, Mike agrees that they should think about outsourcing all
transportation. In this context, it can be useful to look for transport service providers
who are paid only for an executed transport service, as in the letter and parcel service
industry. From calculations similar to those conducted in Sect. 8.3, Bavarian Wood
knows the costs per ton if they decided to hire again.
Mike suggests contacting several forwarding companies to collect information
about their tariffs for all possible import connections between Bavarian Wood’s four
seaports and three manufacturing facilities. One week later, there is another meeting
between Mike and the board members. Mike wants to use this meeting to explain
how the transportation costs can be minimized if the transport service providers are
paid by carried tons only.

During the last week, Mike contacted several freight carriage companies and
asked for their tariffs to move freight between the seaports and the manufacturing
sites. More speciﬁcally, he had asked for the price per ton moved between a given
seaport as the loading location and a given factory as the unloading location. Mike
collected all the information. For each of the 12 possible transportation links, he
selected the cheapest freight carrier. The associated tariffs (per ton) are given in
Fig. 8.12. Additionally, Mike has indicated the supply quantities available at each
seaport and the quantities ordered by each factory per week.

8.5.1

The Transportation Problem

The transportation problem [or the Hitchcock distribution problem (Hitchcock
1941)] addresses the situation outlined in Fig. 8.12 and aims to minimize the total
sum of transport expenses while the individual demand from each receiving node is
fulﬁlled and no supply node supplies more quantities than it has in stock. As can be
seen from the example in Fig. 8.12, solving the transportation problem is not a trivial
task. For each supply node it must be decided which quantity is assigned to which
receiving node, and vice-versa for each receiving node, as it has to be decided which
quantity is ordered from which supply node.
The core to solving the transportation problem is to assign the shipped quantities
to each available transport link connecting a seaport (supply node) with a
manufacturing site (receiving node). If zero quantity is assigned to a link, then this
link is not used. It is necessary to select those shipment quantities for each link where
the sum of costs over all transportation links is minimal, but where the demand for
each receiving node is fulﬁlled (restriction A) and no supply node stock is exceeded
(restriction B). Obviously, all assigned quantities must be zero or larger than zero
(restriction C).

Decision Model

Similar to the warehouse location problem (WLP) in Chap. 7, it is possible to
represent (to “model”) the decision situation associated with the Hitchcock distribution problem in terms of a linear optimization model. The parameters of this model
[Eqs. (8.5)–(8.8)] are as follows. The set S contains all of the supply nodes and for
each element s ∈ S the available (stored) supply quantity qs is known. All receiving
nodes are collected in the set R and node r ∈ R requests the quantity dr. All
quantities are expressed in tons per week. The costs for moving one ton from supply
node s ∈ S to the receiving node r ∈ R is written over the corresponding arc in
Fig. 8.12 and this cost factor is csr. There are no discounts available if the transported
quantity is increased.
The decision variables are xsr, representing the transport quantity assigned to the
transportation link originating from the supply node s and terminating in the
receiving node r. All non-negative real values are allowed for xsr.

It is necessary to minimize the total transportation costs (8.5). The individual
demand of all receiving nodes must be covered (8.6), but the available stock is to be
considered (8.7). All quantities assigned to a transportation link must be
non-negative (8.8). This linear program formulation of the Hitchcock distribution
problem was originally introduced by Dantzig (1951), who has also proposed an
elegant algorithm to determine optimal transport quantities for each link. This
method is known today as the modiﬁed distribution (MODI) method. However,
the MODI method presumes that a feasible initial solution for the model (8.5)–(8.8)
is already available. Therefore, such a construction procedure is discussed ﬁrst in
Sect. 8.5.3, before the MODI methodology is introduced. The MODI algorithm is
then used to iterate and improve the initial solution, taking care that, for each
iteration, feasibility is maintained and the costs are reduced. This two-phase concept,
comprised of a construction phase and a subsequently processed improvement
phase, is an important and well-investigated approach to the identiﬁcation of optimal
or sub-optimal solutions to an optimization model. Mike is going to explain the
computation of the cost of the minimal transport quantity assignment using the
MODI approach. He uses the example data given in Fig. 8.12.

Distribution and Transportation Network Design

Practical Insights In practice, the transportation problem can also be
solved for cases with capacity bottlenecks. In this situation, the capacity
can be extended by the so-called over-costs. In addition, the transportation problem can be extended to the multi-stage SC setting such as
cross-docking or hub-and-spoke systems. This form is called a
transshipment problem.

8.5.3

Finding the First Feasible Model Solution

Mike starts the construction of a ﬁrst feasible assignment by analyzing the total
quantities demanded as well as the total available quantities. To apply the MODI
approach, it is necessary that these two sums are equal (“balanced transportation
problem”). Since equality is not observed in our example (the sum of supply
quantities are 100 tons, but total demand is only 85 tons) Mike introduces an
artiﬁcial customer (“dummy demand node”) that requests the residual supply quantity. The artiﬁcial transportation costs towards this artiﬁcial demand node are set to
0. With this modiﬁcation, the transportation problem is now “balanced” with respect
to demand and supply in the SC (Fig. 8.13).
In order to keep the description of the construction algorithm as compact as
possible, Mike presents all data in the so-called transportation matrix shown in
Fig. 8.14. The heads of the rows contain the seaport names and the available supply
quantities, but the column heads carry the names of the demanding nodes (factories)
and the quantities demanded. The spanned matrix consists of 4  4 cells. In the upper
left corner of the cell in row i and column j Mike writes the costs cij for shipping 1 ton
along the link originating from i and terminating in j.

Currently, all cells are empty but Mike is going to ﬁll them consecutively with the
quantities that are forwarded along the corresponding transportation links. Mike
starts with the upper left hand cell that represents the transportation link from
Rotterdam to Munich (1 ! 1). This cell (connection) is marked the bold frame.
Mike assigns as much quantity to this link as possible. The maximal quantity is
30 tons since Rotterdam does not offer a larger quantity. Mike assigns 30 tons to the
labelled link and writes this quantity in the marked cell. After this assignment, Mike
concludes two issues. First, the demand from Munich is partially unsatisﬁed (10 tons
have to be carried there from another seaport), but Rotterdam cannot be used to
supply any other location. Therefore, Mike can close all remaining connections
starting in Rotterdam. He indicates this closure by writing a “-” into the affected
cells (Fig. 8.15).
Mike is going to ﬁll the next cells. He tries to satisfy the demand of the only
partially served site in Munich. This means that he assigns 10 tons to the link
Wilhelmshaven to Munich with a cost factor of 35 €/ton. Now the demand from
Munich is completely satisﬁed and Mike closes all connections terminating here.
These cannot be used further (Fig. 8.16).

Wilhelmshaven has still some quantity available and the remaining 5 tons are
now assigned to the next available demand location after Munich. This is Salzburg
(see Fig. 8.17).
The stock size at Wilhelmshaven is exhausted, but demand from Salzburg is not
yet completely fulﬁlled. Mike selects Bremerhaven as the next available supply node
after Wilhelmshaven (Fig. 8.18). Bremerhaven provides the remaining 5 tons for
Salzburg.
The demand from Salzburg is completely fulﬁlled, but Bremerhaven still has
15 tons available. This quantity is given to the next demand location which is Prague
(Fig. 8.19).
However, Bremerhaven is unable to completely fulﬁl the demand from Prague.
The remaining quantity of 20 tons is provided by the next supply location after
Bremerhaven, which is Hamburg (Fig. 8.20).
Figure 8.21 shows the completed ﬁrst transportation matrix which represents the
ﬁrst constructed feasible solution of the transportation model. The residual supply

quantity of 15 tons is assigned to the link originating from Hamburg and heading to
the dummy demand node. All used transportation links are shaded in grey.
This construction scheme is called the north-west corner rule (Gass 2003). Mike
determines the costs associated with the instantiated transport quantities by totalling
products of assigned quantities and the cost coefﬁcients. Here, Mike gets 40 €/t0 
30 t0 + 35 €/t0  10 t0 + 36 €/t0  5 t0 + 43 €/t0  5 t0 + 42 €/t0  15 t0 + 38 €/t0 
20 t0 + 0 €/t0  15 t0¼ 3335 € as total forwarding costs.

8.5.4

Optimality Check

After the presentation of the construction procedure, Mike is asked by Walter if the
proposed solution is optimal and how Mike can check if it is optimal. In general, the
application of the matrix minimum method does not lead to the optimal solution of
the model, Mike replies. However, there is an intuitive way to check if and how the
assignment can be modiﬁed so that costs are reduced.
The basic idea is to ﬁnd out whether shifting some of the quantities between the
transportation links will lead to a cost reduction. If such a shift is impossible, then the
available solution is optimal, as no further cost reductions are possible. On the other
hand, if a cost-reducing shift is identiﬁed and applied immediately, this leads to a
new and updated assignment with lower total costs.
Total costs of 3335 € are associated with the transportation links used so far. The
used transportation link is called a base link and a currently unused link is called a
non-base link. Mike is going to check whether the usage so far of a non-base line will
lead to a cost reduction. Therefore, Mike ﬁrst distributes the current cost amount
over all network nodes.

Therefore, he introduces the so-called potential values ui for supply node i ∈ S
and vj for receiving node j ∈ R and splits the costs cij for all currently used
transportation links i ! j so that cij ¼ ui + vj. This leads to the system of linear
equalities shown in Eqs. (8.9)–(8.15). There is a unique solution if we set v1 ¼ 0
(without this setting there would be more than one solution). This solution can be
derived by the application of the Gaussian elimination method. In the example
considered here, we get the potential values u1 ¼ 40, u2 ¼ 35, u3 ¼ 42, u4 ¼ 38,
v1 ¼ 0, v2 ¼ 1, v3 ¼ 0 and v4 ¼ 38. These values are written in brackets (see
Fig. 8.22).
Mike is now able to calculate imputed cost factors c’ij per ton for the currently
unused links by adding the potential ui for the starting location i and the potential vj
for the terminating location j (c’ij :¼ ui + vj). If he compares the imputed current costs
with the real costs computing c’ij  cij which apply if a currently unused link is used,
he can see if the incorporation of this leads to savings. These savings/values are
written in the upper right corners of the cells representing the recently unused cells
(small black rectangles). All connections with the exceptions of Rotterdam-Prague
and Wilhelmshaven-dummy will lead to a cost reduction. Therefore, the initial
solution is not an optimal solution.
If Mike ﬁnds out for a given solution that there is no non-base connection
associated with a positive (>0) saving c’ij  cij per ton, then the solution currently
available is optimal. Therefore, Mike can use the implied savings c’ij  cij associated

230

with non-base connections as a general optimality criterion in order to check whether
a given feasible solution is optimal or not.

8.5.5

Solution Improvement

Since Mike has found out that the constructed solution is not optimal, he has to
modify it. Therefore, he ﬁrst identiﬁes the non-base connection with the highest
saving per ton. This is the link Bremerhaven to Munich with a saving of 9 € per
assigned ton (3 ! 1). Mike indicates this link with a black bold frame (see Fig. 8.22).
Since each ton assigned to this link reduces the total transportation costs by 9 €,
Mike wants to assign the highest possible quantity Y to this link. Therefore, he has to
move some quantities between the links already used. When Mike assigns Y tons to
the delivery from Bremerhaven to Munich, then Munich receives Y tons above the
quantity demanded. Therefore, the quantity associated with another link used
terminating in Munich must be reduced by Y tons. In the example shown in
Fig. 8.23, the quantity to be shipped from Wilhelmshaven to Munich is reduced
by Y tons. However, the reduction of the quantity to be shipped from
Wilhelmshaven reduces the total outbound quantity by Y tons. This implies the
need to increase the quantity to be shipped from Wilhelmshaven to another location
by Y tons in order to prevent the reduction of the total outbound quantity associated
with Wilhelmshaven. Here, it is only possible to increase the quantity assigned to the
link Wilhelmshaven to Salzburg by Y units. Now, Salzburg receives a too great a
quantity so that the inbound quantity provided by another supply node must be
reduced by Y tons. Here, only the quantity assigned to the link Bremerhaven to
Salzburg is reduced by 5 tons. After this reduction, all inconsistencies related to the
assigned quantities are solved. The sequence of the arcs shown in Fig. 8.23
represents the sequence of modiﬁed shipment quantities. This is known as the
“zig-zag path”. For its construction, only base connections are allowed to be
modiﬁed.

Following the zig-zag path, Mike can determine the maximal feasible value that
can be assigned to Y. Therefore, he records all original quantities from which he has
subtracted Y. Since the updated quantities must not become negative, Mike assigns
the minimal recorded value to Y. In the example, it is Y :¼ min{10;5} ¼ 5. The
resulting updated solution is shown in Fig. 8.24. The costs associated with this new
solution are 3335 €  5 t0  9 €/t0 ¼ 3290 €.
Mike summarizes the steps to update the solution for the transportation problem.
1. Determine the potential values ui and vj for all involved locations.
2. Determine the imputed costs c’ij ¼ ui + vj for all current non-base links
(connections).
3. Compare the imputed costs with the real costs. If ui + vj  cij > 0 for at least one
non-base link, the given solution is not optimal (otherwise it is an optimal
solution).
4. Select the non-base link i*  j* with the maximal savings value ui + vj  cij
per ton.
5. Determine the quantity Y to be assigned to the link originating from i* and
termination in j* by the determination of a zig-zag-path through the current base
links.
These ﬁve steps are repeated until in step (3) it is recognized that there is no
non-base link whose incorporation will reduce the total cost. Figures 8.24, 8.25,
8.26, 8.27, 8.28, 8.29, and 8.30 contain the intermediate transportation matrices that
are consecutively generated by the repeated application of steps (1)–(5).
The third transportation matrix is non-optimal, so that a zig-zag-path is determined (Fig. 8.25). Here, both base links Wilhelmshaven to Salzburg and
Bremerhaven to Prague carry the same minimal quantity of 10 tons. The ﬁrst of
both base links Wilhelmhaven to Salzburg becomes a non-base link (“-”) while the
other link remains a base link and the quantity is set to 0 (Fig. 8.26).
The MODI method can be used to optimize the assignment of quantities to
different transportation links in a many-to-many-network set-up. Besides this

Also, alternative improvement algorithms, like stepping-stone algorithms (Charnes
and Cooper 1954), can be used to identify optimal solutions for a transportation
model.

Distribution Network Design

8.6.1

Case Study: ALDI vs. Homeplus

The learning objectives of this case study are to (1) identify basic trade-offs between
facility, inventory, transportation costs, and distribution network design; and
(2) understand an alignment between SC responsiveness and efﬁciency.
ALDI stands for Albrecht Discount, and is a supermarket founded in Germany in
1913. The chain has expanded immensely and can today be found all over the world.
ALDI’s strategy is to sell very reasonable quality at discount prices. The unique
combination of being efﬁcient, but yet selling high quality products gives ALDI a
competitive advantage.
The company has a purchasing power that makes it simple to use economies of
scale and quantity discounts to buy products. The variety of products is rather
restricted compared to other supermarkets. This allows inventory cost reduction.
The stores are generally rather small and standardized. Moreover, ALDI chooses
relatively low-cost locations for their supermarkets. This also cuts down facility
costs. Transportation costs are low as it is typically planned using large batches.
ALDI mainly sells their own brands and keeps marketing and advertising to a
minimum, enabling them to reduce overhead costs. Additionally, proﬁt margins
are quite small compared to ALDI’s competitors. These operational decisions enable
ALDI to sell at low prices while holding a large market share. This strategy works
extremely well for price-conscious customers. However, some consumers might
miss their favorite branded product or a wider variety of products to choose from.
Additionally, other supermarkets offer more non-food products and services, making
them attractive to customers. ALDI has improved in this sector offering, for example, photo or travel services on their web page.
Shopping on the internet has become very popular in recent years. At ﬁrst people
bought only books and electronics, and today basically everything is available
online. Many supermarkets such as Walmart and Tesco have developed concepts
where customers can order online and have groceries delivered to their homes. Tesco
is known by the name Homeplus in South Korea and adapts its business model to
better meet the needs and preferences of its local customers. While they also offered
online grocery shopping, Homeplus was considering a better way of reaching
customers, i.e. through the “virtual store” concept. The virtual store is based on
m-commerce technology in which shoppers can browse through pictures of available
products in a public place, in this case a subway station. Products can be selected by
scanning the QR-code with a smartphone which uses a mobile application to directly
order products. The products are then sent to the customer’s home within the same
day. Deliveries are arranged to arrive quickly, so the groceries will be in the
shopper’s kitchen that night and there is no need to wait in to receive them.
The virtual store ﬁt perfectly with the expectations of local customers: sales
increased 130% in 3 months, and the number of registered users went up by 76%.
The virtual m-commerce store might be more suitable for the Korean market than
most other markets. Yet the beneﬁts, such as shorter shopping times, convenient

8.6 Distribution Network Design

235

order and payment services, and home delivery may also become more and more
appreciated around the world, just as more and more countries will reach smartphone
acceptance rates similar to those of South Korea. From an SCM perspective,
additional beneﬁts can be achieved. Most notably, physical stores can be eliminated,
leading to a more cost-effective SC with direct shipping as a distribution strategy.
The entire purchasing process can be automated without any human intervention
from the retailer’s side. With fewer centralized distribution centers, higher customer
service (product availability) rates and reduced safety stock can be achieved. However, delivery costs for very small quantities could become a serious issue,
depending on customers’ order behavior and stores’ delivery pricing policy.
Homeplus displays its goods at public transportation hubs, such as metro stations.
Customers can observe the products on posters, like on a real shelf, and can scan
them with their smartphone. What is the premise for the big hit? Korea is an early
adopter when it comes to technology. In 2011, 40% of the entire South Korean
population was using smartphones. So scanning items via QR codes makes it easy
for customers to shop while they are waiting. Homeplus was rewarded for its
creativity. The application was downloaded 900,000 times in the ﬁrst year and the
company was even nominated for multiple design awards. Sales increased
tremendously and Homeplus is now the number one retailer online. The company
is expanding its virtual stores to bus stops and train stations.
From the operational point of view there are, as always, up- and downsides to the
virtual store. Delivering goods directly to the customer reduces the number of goods
sold in the store. As a result, less stock is needed and inventory costs are reduced.
Moreover, online ordering makes it easier to track items and potentially fewer goods
are lost through theft, miscounting, or other human intervention. Also, with direct
shipping, the FIFO method is fairly easy to apply, as customers are not able to pick
between the same types of goods from the shelf. This way the products that are closer
to being out-of-date can be sold prior to the longer lasting goods. Moreover,
customer service is improved when the availability of items is higher, since they
are delivered from central warehouses. This again reduces costs for warehousing
along with personnel costs. In short, having online ordering and direct deliveries
makes it easy to design a more cost-efﬁcient SC compared to traditional selling in
stores.
Most importantly, customers beneﬁt immensely from the innovation. They can
use their waiting time at the bus stop or metro station to do their grocery shopping.
Time is a precious good in today’s society, which is perhaps why buying food after
work may be more of a hassle to most people than a pleasure. With the highly
developed technology in South Korea, the virtual store concept is easy to use.
Moreover, stores are less crowded, which is another beneﬁt passively affecting
ofﬂine shoppers. Increased customer service improves the reputation of Homeplus
compared to their competitors. It is important that Homeplus pays great attention to
its service level so that they continue to please their potential consumers. These
concerns include the functionality of the smartphone application as well as on-time
deliveries and the quality of products. A disadvantage of the concept can arise with
delivery costs. As all goods are delivered directly, the shipping costs may be higher.

236

Distribution and Transportation Network Design

Homeplus can design an efﬁcient delivery system using milk-run truck deliveries to
multiple customers in nearby areas.
Additionally, making goods and prices available online improves comparability.
There are already many applications helping the customer to ﬁnd the cheapest goods
at each of the stores. This trend is likely to increase. This makes it necessary for
vendors to focus on unique selling points so they do not ﬁnd themselves exposed to
selling at drop-down prices.
Discussion:
• Consider trade-offs between inventory costs, number of warehouses, and transportation costs at ALDI and Homeplus. Explain the efﬁciency and responsiveness
issues in the case study based on these trade-offs.
• Which factors of efﬁciency and responsiveness can you identify at ALDI and
Homeplus?
• Which distribution strategy is used by Homeplus in South Korea?
• Which transportation strategy is used by Homeplus in South Korea?
• Which factors facilitated the Homeplus concept in South Korea?
• Is it possible to implement a virtual store in your country? What challenges might
be encountered?

8.6.2

Types of Distribution Networks

According to the transportation network design, different distribution network
structures can be distinguished (Fig. 8.31).
In the case of direct shipments, distribution is organized as a direct network, with
storage on the manufacturing side. Alternatively, if the production strategy is
assemble-to-order (ATO) or make-to-order (MTO), the products can be delivered
directly to customers (for example, this has been DELL’s strategy).
In the retailing business, most distribution networks are organized as multi-stage
systems with intermediate warehouses, distribution centers, cross-docking centers,
and hub terminals. Such complex systems are typically managed by logistics service
providers. As examples, consider cross-docking and hub-and-spoke networks.
Cross-docking implements the idea of the consolidation of goods from inbound
trucks to outbound trucks via an intermediate transit point (i.e. the cross-docking
center). The special feature of cross-docking is that goods do not remain in the
warehouse longer than 24 h (see Fig. 8.32).
Some advantages of cross-docking are the realization of economies of scale in
transportation, frequent bundled deliveries, inventory reduction, faster product ﬂow,
reduction of errors, savings in material handling and labor costs, increase in ﬂeet
capacity utilization, and mitigation of the bullwhip effect. At the same time, a high
investment is required to establish a cross-docking terminal. The coordination
complexity and risks of stock-out/disruptions in the SC also increase. Finally, data

security issues become crucial. Examples of successful cross-docking realization can
be found in many retailing companies, e.g., Walmart, E. LeClerc, etc.
Hub-and-spoke network also implements the idea of consolidation (Fig. 8.33).
A hub represents the consolidation element in the distribution network. Spokes
are the regional warehouses and customers. This concept is used for shipment
consolidation with similar advantages and disadvantages as cross-docking. For
example, the airport Leipzig-Halle is DHL’s largest hub in Germany. In further
course of the chapter, you will ﬁnd case studies on different distribution networks.

8.6.3

Case Study: Seven-Eleven Japan

The Seven-Eleven Japan Co. Ltd was founded in 1974 and grew to be one of the
largest retail networks, with more than 50,000 stores worldwide with an average area
of 100–150 m2 per store. At ﬁrst, the company’s SC was straightforward, oriented
from producers to the stores (Fig. 8.34).
This type of structure resulted in signiﬁcant shortcomings. Due to the high
number of facilities, high total facility/handling, inventory, and logistics costs
(more than 70 deliveries a day to the stores) were encountered. The information
line was too long which negatively impacted the service level because of low
response times and inventory turnover (about 25 turns a year in 1970s).
In redesigning the distribution network, Seven-Eleven Japan (SEJ) undertook
some crucial changes. The key objectives of the redesign were to further enhance
customer satisfaction and proﬁtability. The objectives were reducing costs,
preventing stock-outs, and ensuring high quality products. The company launched
several actions, such as high investment in information and communication systems,
identiﬁcation of an adequate partner for each region, and assurance of long-term

relationships. In addition, a combined delivery system (CDS) was developed which
was based on the absence of direct store delivery (Fig. 8.35).
Different manufacturers and distributors from the same geographical regions
consolidate their shipments to minimize the number of trucks going to the combined
distribution centers (CDC). The ﬁve CDCs (i.e., frozen products, chilled products,
fresh foods, drinks and noodles, and magazines) are sorted by product category and
required storage temperature. From here, different suppliers’ products are delivered
to the shops. For some products (e.g., fresh boxed products), deliveries happen
several times a day. For frozen products, three deliveries a week are enough. Each
truck’s tour covers more than one store, preferably during off-peak hours. By

240

Distribution and Transportation Network Design

omitting the need for the inspection of incoming goods, the costs of the whole SC
operations can be further decreased.
A changed distribution network design affects all stages in the SC and the SC
costs (inventory, transportation, facilities, and information). Stores have to reconﬁgure store shelves at least three times daily and storefronts cater to different consumer
segments and demands at different times. SEJ headquarters should design and
manage location, transportation, inventory, and information systems to support
their objectives. They are also responsible for planning new stores locations to
ensure a strong presence. On-time delivery is now the supplier’s responsibility. In
the event of non-compliance with agreed delivery dates, the supplier has to pay a
penalty equivalent to the gross margin of the product being delivered. In return for
this, suppliers are rewarded with long-term business relationships and adoption in
new projects, such as the e-commerce project “7dream.com”. In conclusion, awareness of customer needs and the management’s ability to react and respond to market
preferences by simultaneously considering costs, ensure the long-term economic
success of SEJ.
Redesigning SEJ achieved improvements in many areas, e.g. growth in sales
(+11.29%), store numbers (+5.84%), and proﬁt margins (+30%); higher sales per
square meter; higher average per store day sale (66,900 yen/51,500 yen), daily
number of customers (1059 in SEJ/industry average 880), remarkably low stockout rate, an increase in SC efﬁciency, a decreasing inventory relative to sales, a
reduction in the number of stock keeping units (SKUs) to 2500, a decrease in
inventory turnover (45 turns instead of 14 in 1974), and a decrease in the average
number of deliveries to each store.
Discussion
• Identify impacts on different actors in the SC after a redesign of the distribution
system.
• Why has Seven-Eleven chosen off-site preparation of fresh foods and subsequent
delivery to stores?
• How did the following SC costs change: inventories/transportation/facilities and
handling/information?
• What is the name of the transportation strategy when the tour of each truck starts
from a distribution center and covers more than one store?
• Which transportation network design is used in the SEJ case? What are the
advantages and limitations of this network type?

Transportation Modes

Case Study: Transportation of Shoes from China to Austria via Hamburg
Diary of a container full of shoes from the company Deichmann (see Fig. 8.36).
In the following, the journey of a container from Wenzhou to Vienna is described,
based on the article “Schuhe unterwegs” in HHLA-Messe-Magazine, 2011.

8.6 Distribution Network Design

Fig. 8.36 Deichmann’s transportation chain

Ningbo, China, 7 November, 11:30: One of the largest container ships is loaded
with different containers. One of them is container CMAU 146090-0, which is
loaded with the Deichmann shoe collection. The shoes are produced in Whenzou
and transported to Ningbo, where the container is loaded onto a container ship.
Suez Canal, 28 November, 0:57: The container ship sails the 160 km-long Suez
Canal at 7.5 knots. The Suez Canal is one of the most important shipping routes in
the world.
Hamburg, Burchardkai, 29 November, 8:00: The container ship has capacity for
14,000 standard boxes. This means that good planning of the loading process is
essential in the different ports. At the HHLA Container Terminal Burchardkai
loading preparations for the port of Le Havre are under way, overseen by a
responsible ship planner.
Le Havre, 7 December, 6:00: The container ship is leaving Le Havre after a short
stop. The ship planner is organizing the dispatching and loading of the ship in
Hamburg. The ship planner uses planning software to decide where each container
will be stacked.
Hamburg, Burchardkai, 10 December, 8:45: Tugboats are helping the container
ship to dock. Giant, detailed planned dispatching machinery starts.
9:00: The responsible ship planner decides together with the container ship’s
ofﬁcer when the planned loading and reloading is going to be done.
12:14: From 9 o’clock dispatching starts. Several thousands of containers have to
be reloaded.
12:15: For such cases, the HHLA has invested in berths and efﬁcient bridges.
12:16: The bridge driver has an inside monitor so he can see which containers he
has to take. At the same time another ship planner controls the number of unloaded
containers.
12:17: The driver of the van-carrier gets an automatic message when the
containers have been put down on the quay side.

12:20: The driver of the van-carrier is putting down the container full of shoes.
The cranes are computer-assisted and they move the container into an optimal
position for interim storage.
Hamburg, Burchardkai, 11 December, 10:50: The container is loaded onto the
train by the company Metrans going towards Prague. The train is fully loaded with
60 containers.
11:25: Loading from interim storage and the train is done by ten van-carriers. The
van-carrier drivers obtain their information about the loading process from the
computerized networks. The goal is to achieve a smooth loading and unloading.
14:31: Metrans employees are organizing processes for the 1781 Metrans trains,
which are transporting the goods from Prague to Hamburg. The container with the
shoes is loaded onto the ﬁrst section of the train.
15:48: The 600 m-long train is leaving the port of Hamburg. The computerized
network informs the Metrans dispatcher in Prague and the logistics experts from
Deichmann that the container is on the way to Prague.
Decin, goods rail depot, 12 December, 6:10: A change of locomotive drivers.
Metrans has a special logistic plan of their capacity utilization so that they are able to
transport more containers than their competitors. Of the international trafﬁc overseas
on the rail networks, 75% is done by Metrans.
Prague, 12 December, 8:57: The train is arriving at one of the largest transshipment centers in Europe. A total of 15,000 containers can be stored and ten trains
can be loaded and reloaded at the same time.
Dunajska Streda, 13 December, 9:11: The company Deichmann opened their new
distribution center next to the terminal area. The terminal area offers space for
25,000 containers. The shoes arrive at the distribution center where they are arranged
into various transport units for the different cities.
Vienna, permanent establishment of Schenker, 14 December, 13:45: The container destined for Vienna is leaving the distribution center. The container arrives at
the warehouse in the Gottfried-Schenkerstreet at 13:45.
Vienna, Mariahilfer Street 41, 15 December, 8:12: The trip from China to Austria
ends at Deichmann’s subsidiary company, in the old Vienna shopping street. The
journey from Ningbo to Vienna has taken 37 days, 20 hours and 42 min.
As we can see from this example, the modern transportation chains are comprised
of different transportation modes (i.e., the intermodal transportation). The main
transportation modes, their advantages and disadvantages are summarized in
Fig. 8.37.
It can be observed from Fig. 8.37 that no single transportation mode provides the
ideal solution. The selection of the transportation mode is based on prioritizing such
criteria as speed, costs, networking, security, schedules, etc.

Key Points

The fundamental questions in distribution and transportation network design are as
follows:
• When and where do goods in required quantity and quality need to be picked up
and consolidated in order to have them in time at the destination?
• Which service levels have to be respected (on-time delivery, tolerances)?
• Which modes and means of transport are possible and the right choice for the
whole or a deﬁned part of the transport?
• Who organizes and who executes (which part of) the transport?
• Who pays for which part of the transport?
• How can the promised cost for an efﬁcient and reliable transport be minimized?
We have discussed the typical aspects and decision problems of conﬁguring
distribution and transportation networks as they appear today. Thereby, we have
discussed general challenges associated with the setup of the right and appropriate
transportation network; in addition we have provided an in-depth presentation of
particular decision tasks.
At the end of this chapter, we have become familiar with several generic types of
distribution and transportation network structures. Starting from simple direct delivery layouts, we are able to extend these structures by postponement strategies, milkruns, and transshipments in order to achieve economies of scale in the context of
transportation planning through consolidation. However, we have seen that the

244

8

Distribution and Transportation Network Design

success of consolidation depends on the availability of adequate shipments that can
be grouped together to make full truckloads. The risk associated with shipment
consolidation is quite high if the transportation demand varies over time. In such a
situation, the incorporation of a logistics service provider can be beneﬁcial if it is
paid only per shipped quantities. The assignment of quantities to be shipped to
different links in a many-to-many transport network is a complicated decision
problem known as the Hitchcock distribution problem. We have discussed and
applied procedures to solve this important decision task in the context of conﬁguring
a transportation network.

Introductory Case-Study “Factory Planning at Tesla”

The location of a new factory can provide competitive advantage and has strategic
relevance for every company. For once, location inﬂuences cost structures. For
example, producing in a low-wage country inﬂuences the production price of the
product. Risks are constituted by politics, exchange rates and currency swings. Many
companies operate in various countries making use of the advantages in each
location.
On the other hand, innovation plays another important role for business success.
Proximity to universities, research areas or other enterprises operating in the business can enhance innovation incentives. Here, qualiﬁed employees are also easier to
reach, for example through recruiting from universities. Much of the time
governments will support particular areas with tax advantages to trigger the development of innovation clusters. In these areas the infrastructure is well developed.

Therefore, supplies are easily delivered to the area and ﬁnished products to the
retailer or end customer. The location of the market, where the customer is located, is
also relevant.
E-mobility is the new trend in the car industry. With decreasing amounts of fossil
fuel electricity is an attractive option to pursue while helping to protect the environment. But there is criticism that some factories are not zero emission producers but
simply reallocate the emissions elsewhere. Batteries need to be charged by power
plants and batteries are difﬁcult to produce. Nevertheless, researchers found that
electric cars still save energy and are more environmentally friendly than gasoline or
diesel operated vehicles. According to experts, e-mobility could reduce CO2
emissions by 47% by 2030. Companies have discovered this trend and have been
trying to ﬁnd the most efﬁcient versions of e-mobility. The biggest obstacle is still
presented by batteries. Many are expensive to produce or do not last very long.
Moreover, safety issues have to be resolved. Development of lithium-ion batteries
has brought major advancement. Many governments support the implementation of
non-fuel systems. The so-called original equipment manufacturers (OEM) are constantly developing new electric vehicles.
Tesla is one of the new generation enterprises on the e-mobility scene. Recently,
Tesla Roadster and Tesla S presented models for the mass audience. A third one is
planned—a sports version. The cars have a relatively low noise level, zero emission
and cost approximately $35,000. This constitutes serious competition for long
established OEMs.
Tesla’s production plant is located in Fremont, California. The city is located
right in the heart of the prestigious Silicon Valley research area. Here many
companies have settled, producing basically everything technology has to offer.
Silicon Valley became popular in the 1980s and 1990s, and is called a post-fordistic
complex with special dynamics. There are various advantages to this location. Its
proximity to technology-savvy Stanford University is just one of them. So-called
knowledge dynamics and well-educated, highly qualiﬁed employees along with a
ﬁscal friendly policy attract enterprises. Additionally, military and aircraft industries
are close by, which support location factors which are already beneﬁcial. A supplier
network has been developed and established. Moreover, Silicon Valley is located
near San Francisco, which offers a good working atmosphere for its employees.
There are also downsides to the technology cluster. The infrastructure is highly
overloaded. While people have continuously moved to the area, the infrastructure
has not kept pace with demand. Additionally, rent prices have exploded, making it
especially difﬁcult for smaller companies to rent ofﬁce space. Very often, small startups turned out to be the most successful enterprises.
Tesla purchased a dormant production plant in Silicon Valley from Toyota, which
uses relatively little of the huge factory space. Various suppliers deliver lightweight
components to the plant by trucks. The long waiting time for Tesla S0 customers,
currently around 4 months, is especially problematic. This is mainly due to the
shortage of lithium-ion batteries supplied by Panasonic.
In the plant there are eight robots in each assembly line. Usually, a robot is able to
fulﬁl only one task; however, Tesla’s robots are able to handle four at once. Tesla S
is the model currently on the production line. Processing time at each station

9.2 Factory Planning

249

(so-called takt time) is 5 min and the total production lead time (PLT) (so called
cycle time) takes 3–5 days. This is still quite long compared to large car
manufacturers. Eighty Tesla S cars are built on the site every day. In the ﬁrst year
20,000 cars were planned, which is rather a small number compared to Tesla’s big
competitors such as Hyundai and Beijing Motors. Tesla started its business around
10 years ago and is still working on a much smaller scale. Nevertheless, it is fairly
successful. Currently, Tesla is upgrading the factory for the assembly of an SUC
model or a sports car. The assembly line will remain the same; only the robots have
to be reprogrammed. This factory concept is extremely ﬂexible and saves enormous
investment costs compared to building a new production line or plant.

Role of Factory Planning in SCOM

Factory planning and process design problems occur when, for example, an existing
factory requires adaptation in order to make sure that new products can be produced
using the existing infrastructure. Planning and design could also be required to
implement new technology into the production process so that through-put times
can be reduced. These are just two typical problems when the factory has to be
modiﬁed to generate competitive advantage.
But there are also problems related to the creation of completely new factories.
The erection of a completely new manufacturing facility is also considered the
“green-ﬁeld approach”, compared to the “brown-ﬁeld approach” when modifying
existing plants.
Sometimes it might also be necessary to centralize the so-called production
footprint, which means that factories might be adjusted in their size (expanded or
reduced) in a case where factories might be closed or parts of old ones might be
reactivated. Current challenges in the business demand dynamic, adaptable, scalable
and modular factories (Wiendahl et al. 2005; Schenk et al. 2014). This is related—
among many other inﬂuencing factors—to shorter product life cycles and shorter
time-to-market requirements as well as improvement in production technology.
Additionally, a fast reaction to changing market needs and technological conditions
requires the design of new and modular factories. Grundig (2015) provides a very
structured and systematic approach on the processes and steps in factory planning.

250

9 Factory Planning and Process Design

A new, modular factory is the one that BMW created in Leipzig, Germany. This
facility covered the three main production areas of the car—body shop, paint shop
and ﬁnal assembly. The important aspect is the scalability and the expansion
potential the factory has in order to enable adjustments to its layout in accordance
with market development. Recently the Leipzig plant has been expanded in order to
produce BMW’s electrical vehicles as well.
It becomes evident that the spectrum of “factory planning and process design”
covers a broad variety of practical problems that are approached in a structured way.
It is the purpose of this chapter to elaborate on the approach and steps taken to solve
the challenges summarized above.

9.2.2

Processes of Factory Planning

Systematic factory planning is related to a planning cascade, also referred to as a
“planning pyramid”, from the initial idea, through the process of the ideal factory, to
the detailed elaboration, to when the factory ﬁnally operates. In general, one will
need to consider the steps of target planning, concept development, elaboration and
evaluation of alternatives and execution of the selected alternative leading to the ﬁnal
factory building.
Three basic processes in factory planning can be classiﬁed as in Table 9.1.

Main contents or results to be achieved
Collection of requirements (e.g. production programme);
Analysis of tasks that need to be performed;
Health, Safety and Environment (HSE)/feasibility studies that need to be
considered;
Description of functional areas and expected output, layout alternatives;
Layout models/site layout plans to be presented;
Required documents to obtain authority approval.
Statements of work (e.g. also for subcontracting purposes);
Screening of quotations/offers to be evaluated;
Detailed project plans and related information on realization and capacity planning
(who/which company is going to work when on what to be ﬁnalized by when (this
is a very challenging task for the project management team);
Purchasing plans for heavy equipment (e.g. robots, transportation devices,
machines, logistical equipment, cranes. . .);
Plans for the IT installations such as terminals for shop-ﬂoor management, etc.;
Plans for departmental commuting;
Plans for the training or hiring workforce.
Plans on the ﬁnal approval and commissioning of the factory and its functional
areas to make sure it can be operated;
Documents to be obtained from external approval bodies, quality certiﬁcates, HSE
and construction approval;
Planning of the ramp-up phase including training and education of the workforce,
Preparation for start of volume production.

9.2 Factory Planning

251

Consider these processes in more detail.
Planning pre-requisites and factory planning preparation consists of the collection of the relevant short-, medium- and long-term inputs for the factory planning
project. This target planning is the input for structuring the process and for creating
the planning documentation. The results from this ﬁrst block create the precise
formulation of the tasks and targets/objectives of the factory planning process and
have contributed to a ﬁrst or pre-feasibility study.

9.2.2.1 Factory Structure Planning
This complex deals with the creation of the ﬁrst high-level factory layout designs
which support the evaluation of alternative concepts for the factory. It is important to
mention that in this case an ideal view is taken, which means that potential
constraints regarding the available infrastructure or pieces of land are not considered.
The reason for this disconnected view is to develop the most appropriate structure
(principle planning), the identiﬁcation of the main production areas, the necessary
assembly processes and also the required logistical ﬂows and set up.
In other words, this planning complex has the objective to evaluate and select the
most appropriate structure under the best conditions and it also aims at dimensioning
the functional areas. Furthermore the connection and logistical linkages as well as
the process sequencing are advanced by the factory planning team so that an ideal
layout of the factory can be presented. Once this has been agreed to, adaptation to the
real existing or available conditions is made. This transfer from the ideal scenario to
what can be achieved is leading to the generation of the so-called realistic layout.
The different variants presented (scenarios) can be mentioned as well as the related
feasibility study.
Still, it might be necessary to de-couple functional areas due to vibrations (e.g., a
press shop), and to separate buildings in order to comply with local construction
rules and regulations (e.g., ﬁre protection, noise emission, pollution) or to consider a
special foundation. These aspects differ from case to case and from country to
country so that this will need to be investigated in detail once a decision for a new
factory is made in practice.

9.2.2.2 Detail Planning and Project Preparation for Realization
After management has decided on the preferred factory layout variant, the detailed
planning (ﬁne planning) takes place. Starting with the block layouts (rough layouts)
that were described earlier, the exact allocation and space for machines, positioning
of supporting equipment, planning of additional space and ofﬁce infrastructure
(locker rooms, medical support, ofﬁces, sanitary space), but also planning of
media (gas, water, electricity, information technology. . .) have to take place. One
could say that the “empty facility” of the rough planning is now ﬁlled in with its
exact functional content (ﬁne planning) so that the factory can ﬁnally be created.
The deliverable of this process is the factory planning project including all detailed
plans.

252

9 Factory Planning and Process Design

9.2.2.3 Project Realization
When details are deﬁned, the suppliers and partners will need to be involved in line
with the project plan speciﬁed. In parallel to all these planning complexes a team will
need to make the necessary cost calculations (business case development and
validation) followed by running stringent cost controlling. Additionally, the
planning needs to be properly set up by a project management team to track progress,
to visualize it and to alert in case of deviations. These could be cost, time or quality
related deviations. These are typical tasks that will be run under the guidance of the
factory planning project management team.
In order to make the factory planning process with typical use case scenarios
more transparent for the reader, the short cases are presented as follows:
• An existing factory is regularly adjusted to current production needs.
• An existing factory is completely redesigned to meet strategic objectives.
• A new factory is completely built from scratch in order to generate competitive
advantage in a new market.
• Temporary factory with a partner.

9.2.2.4 An Existing Factory Is Regularly Adjusted to Current Production
Needs
The factories are planned from a layout and process point of view in a way to ensure
ﬂawless execution of all necessary production and assembly steps. This is also done
in consideration with the corresponding production system and its underlying Lean
principles. The company needs to adjust its production and thus the layout of the
factory whenever there is a new product launched. That means the team dealing with
factory planning reviews the existing factory, the material ﬂow from the incoming
area over the storage area, considers the involvement and allocation of suppliers into
the production process, and deals with questions as to how to test the product and
how to ship it to the customer. As we can see, factory planning is linked to layout
planning, production sequencing and also recognizing the importance of a streamlined material ﬂow. If there are new production or assembly steps, if there are more
suppliers that need to be involved, if the existing buildings need to be adjusted or if
there is a need to create a new building, this is all done by the factory planning
department. As this ﬁrst case shows, even without creating a completely new factory,
the aspect of factory planning plays a crucial role during the normal production of
the product portfolio and thus represents a regular task to ensure continuous
improvement.
9.2.2.5 An Existing Factory Is Completely Redesigned in Order to Meet
Strategic Objectives
In contrast to the above summarized continuous adjustment of the factory to meet
current production needs, a complete factory makeover is a task where the location
of the factory on the plot of land remains the same, but where fundamental changes

9.2 Factory Planning

253

are implemented. Such a complete factory makeover is furthermore based on a
strategic decision as it involves signiﬁcant investment.
Based on inputs from the sales team regarding the expected production
programme for the next few years, the resulting capacity needs are derived. That
means an understanding is required of what type of product and in what quantity is
expected to be placed on the market. This information is provided to the factory
planning team on an aggregated level. The factory planners then review the existing
setup of the facility and determine which production steps are necessary, what kind
of technology is required and what it means in terms of manufacturing hours,
stations and number of buildings.
For example, a strategic decision was made to almost double the production
volume to satisfy global markets. This would require a complete redesign of the
layout, allowing, for example, mixed-model lines with shortened set-up times; it was
also strongly linked to the set-up of a completely new logistics concept to feed the
assembly lines continuously with material from the warehouse. The warehouse
would be completely newly built and so-called logistics trains to be installed to
provide the parts and components to the assembly stations. That means that the shape
of the building remains the same, but the internal allocations of the stations, the
material ﬂow and the allocation of the warehouse have to be completely made over
to satisfy the demands of growing markets.

9.2.2.6 A New Factory Is Completely Built from Scratch in Order
to Generate Competitive Advantage in a New Market
Factory planning also plays a signiﬁcant strategic role with respect to the generation
of competitive advantage. For example, the Indian market might require new
products (e.g., investment goods). To win the corresponding commercial bid, it
would be necessary to ensure that the products are made to a very high degree
locally in India itself. This is also referred to as “local content”. That means a
location needs to be identiﬁed to set up a completely new factory, in which local
staff would create the ﬁnal product with a high proportion of locally sourced
materials. For this case of factory planning, the aspect of location planning would
also be important because the company needs to identify a region in which to create
the new factory on green-ﬁeld site. Under consideration of site selection criteria
(e.g., existing infrastructure, availability of potential workforce, appropriate
suppliers or capable logistics service providers) a location for the factory has to be
identiﬁed. The plot of land also has to provide for possible later expansion of the
factory. Finally, a completely new facility with internal suppliers on site would need
to be created in India.
9.2.2.7 Temporary Factory with a Partner
This is a special case of factory planning, where local content requirements have to
be met, but where no new factory has to be created. Imagine that investment goods
have to be made for a customer in Romania. Assume that this would be related to a

254

9 Factory Planning and Process Design

one-time contract (products are produced, but then no further products have to be
made for that customer), there was no business case for a new factory. In such a
situation, there would be no business case justifying the creation of a new factory. In
order to produce in Romania with local staff for the local customer, the existing
infrastructure would be analysed to ﬁnd already existing facilities that need to meet
the necessary requirements (such as infrastructure, size and height of buildings,
handling equipment, ﬂoor density, etc. . .). In a traditional industrial zone, appropriate facilities could be identiﬁed. The available alternatives will be reviewed
regarding their strategic and operational ﬁt. Finally, the investment goods might be
produced in a factory that originally generated, for example, heavy power plant
transformers. Of course, that factory will need to be replanned with consideration for
the assembly and logistical processes required to ensure on-time and on-quality
delivery of products to the ﬁnal customer. This example shows that factory planning
has to be considered as a strategic decision to be responsive and ﬂexible when it
comes to customer focus.

9.2.2.8 Health, Safety and Environment
It is important to emphasize, that in all examples and activities around factory
planning, the aspect of HSE has highest priority. HSE deals with the proper working
conditions that have to be ensured by the company so that employees can contribute
to value adding under safe and healthy conditions. Thus, the workforce has to be
provided with personal protection accessories, such as safety shoes, gloves, hard
hats, ear plugs, etc. Furthermore, the ergonomic aspects need to be considered and
corresponding tools (e.g. lifting or transportation devices) have to be made available.
People need to be safe when they perform their work. Safety trainings and education
is a mandatory objective. Also, safety and work instructions need to be available for
all employees, including instructions on how to proceed in case of an injury.
Factory planning and HSE are strongly connected, as HSE is also related to
ensuring proper daylight or illumination, as well as to keeping working areas free
from dust (e.g., from welding); smells (e.g., from glues) or from the noise of
machines or processing. Also emissions have to be avoided when for example fork
lift trucks are charging the batteries: proper emission or smoke evacuation technology has to be installed. A safe workplace means also that emergency exits need to be
clearly marked, ﬁre extinguishers are available within easy reach and corresponding
visual aids show the shortest path to extinguishers or to the emergency exit.
Therefore HSE related topics always have to be on top of the agendas in running
operations but also when new operations are planned.

9.3

Capacity Planning

Under capacity, we understand the throughput, or the quantity of units a facility can
hold, receive, store, or produce in a period of time (Heizer and Render 2014). That
means there is a constraint or a limit on production to satisfy demand. This limit can
be theoretical and effective.

9.3 Capacity Planning

255

The theoretical limit is called design capacity which is the maximum theoretical
output of a system. Effective capacity is the capacity a ﬁrm expects to achieve given
current operating constraints (Heizer and Render 2014). In practice, effective capacity is usually lower than design capacity.
Let us look at capacity using a very simple example. Assume that we have a small
bakery shop in a big railway station. If it takes a single person 2 min to prepare a
sandwich, then that person can produce 30 sandwiches (60 min per hour/2 min
preparation time per sandwich ¼ 30 sandwiches) per hour. So, looking at the
aforementioned deﬁnition, the total amount that can be produced per hour is
30 sandwiches, in other words the capacity is equal to 30 sandwiches per hour. In
this theoretical example, we might have analysed that there are peak demands in the
morning hours (8.00 o’clock), during lunchtime (12.00 o’clock) and in the evening
(at 17.00 o’clock), when people are travelling back to their homes. During these
three peak times, the demand might be 90 sandwiches per hour. That shows two
typical operational problems: ﬁrst we have a capacity issue at the peak times; and
second we need to balance capacity according to demand. What we could do, for
example, is to increase the workforce during times of high demand; or we might use
technology to shorten the time to create one product; or we might pre-produce the
components of our sandwiches (this could be pre-slicing of the bread or slicing the
cheese). This simple example indicates that a company needs to know its existing
capacity, so what it is able to perform per period. The company also needs to adjust
its capacity respectively and needs to clearly know where the constraints or
bottlenecks are.
Now, let us translate this way of thinking into the operational world. In order to
determine the capacity, it is necessary to know the products that have to be placed on
the market. This understanding of demand could be order-driven, and/or it could be
forecast driven. In our bakery example, it could be that there is a bank building
nearby which placed a ﬁxed order of 50 sandwiches every day. That means that there
is an existing contract that speciﬁes exactly the quantity and the composition of the
goods. On top of that we know the regular daily demand patterns including the three
peaks per day explained at the beginning of this section. The forecasting aspect plays
a role when we consider vacation periods or other seasonal aspects. It can also
happen that we recognize that daily demand increases about a certain percentage
when there is a football game nearby.
All this is very important information for us to understand the demand of products
per time unit and how to balance that against our existing capacity. This also tells us
that we need to be able to adjust our capacity to cope with swings on the demand
side. As a consequence, we need to have the space, the workforce and the machinery
and tools to meet the demand. Of course this information on future demand is not
only required to determine capacities, but it is also relevant to managing the SC, as
the corresponding need for materials needs to be communicated to suppliers. In the
simpliﬁed bakery example for better illustration purposes, this might be bread,
butter, cheese, etc. In real large factory operations, raw materials, purchased parts
and components need to be in line with foreseen demand as well as with the required
technical and human capacities.

256

9.3.1

9 Factory Planning and Process Design

Queuing Theory

Queuing theory is an important tool for capacity planning in services and industries.
We ﬁnd queues for example in supermarkets or in waiting rooms; or there are queues
of trucks in front of distribution centres or of several orders that have to be processed
in production.
Queuing theory helps to analyse performance of a process such as that of the
temporal arrival of goods in a distribution centre. Performance generally can be
measured in different dimensions such as capacity, time, cost, quality or ﬂexibility
and these factors can inﬂuence each other. The queuing model is a good tool for
analysis of time dimension in a process. In Fig. 9.1, a simple queuing model
(one-channel model) is presented.
A queuing model comprises the following elements:
•
•
•
•

input (e.g., patients)
queue (e.g., patients in the waiting room)
processing station (e.g., a doctor)
output (patients after the treatment).

In queuing theory, different options exist to describe these four elements. To
describe the queues we use the notation
a=b=c,
where
a is probability distribution of arrival rate, e.g.:
• D ¼ degenerate distribution (deterministic)
• M ¼ Markovian distribution (Poisson process)
• G ¼ general distribution;
b is probability distribution of service time
• D ¼ degenerate distribution
• M ¼ exponential distribution
• G ¼ general distribution;
c is number of servers (processing stations)

Fig. 9.1 Queuing model

9.3 Capacity Planning

257

In regard to the number of servers, there are two basic kinds of models. A onechannel model considers only one queue and one server that process the input. A
multiple-channel model is involved with one queue and several servers or several
queues and several servers.
Consider a system where there is no constraint in the queue and we follow the rule
“ﬁrst come ﬁrst serve” for deﬁning the processing sequence. To analyse this case, we
introduce some notations that describe the system components (Fig. 9.2).
We consider the so-called M/M/1 queue. We determine mean number of arrivals
per time period as λ and mean number of people or items served per time period (i.e.,
average service rate) as μ. It means that the arrival rate is Markovian distributed,
service time exponentially distributed and there is one server. We can ﬁnd this
queue, for example, in post ofﬁces or small supermarkets with only one cashier or
in waiting rooms for only one doctor’s surgery.
Consider the following formulas to understand how to analyse the performance of
the queuing process. To determine the time between the arrivals of two customers,
e.g. patients, we use Eq. (9.1):
Estimated inter  arrival time ¼

Task 9.1 Queuing Theory M/M/1 System
In a bookshop in the city centre there is only one cashier because the other two are
off with inﬂuenza. Normally the cashier is able to cash up an average of 70 customers
per hour. But on average there are only 55 customers per hour in the bookshop. Next
to cashing up customers the cashier also has to unpack deliveries. Analyse the
performance of the queue, and check if there is enough time to unpack deliveries.
Inter  arrival time ¼

Task 9.2 Queuing Theory M/M/c System
In the case of an M/M/c queue, formulas are different. We can ﬁnd M/M/c queues for
example in a distribution centre. There are several trucks waiting in waiting zones to
unload their goods onto loading docks or to get loaded. In the case of M/M/c queues
we have a Markovian distribution of arrival rate, an exponential distribution of
service time and c servers (>1).
Consider the following example for M/M/c queues. On average there are 40 trucks
arriving per hour and one loading dock is able to unload and load 12 trucks/h.
Furthermore there are four loading docks. Assume that every loading dock has the
same capacity and needs the same time. There is only one waiting queue.

throughput rate λ (¼ average arrival rate of objects) and the waiting time W (¼
average time an object spends in the system). Little’s Law says “that, under steady
state conditions, the average number of items in a queuing system equals the average
rate at which items arrive multiplied by the average time that an item spends in the
system.” (Little and Graves 2008). Letting
L ¼ average number of items in the queuing system (e.g., work-in-progress
inventory in the system)
W ¼ average waiting time in the system for an item
λ ¼ average number of items arriving per unit time
the law can be represented as Eq. (9.15):
L¼λW

ð9:15Þ

Little’s Law demonstrates that when we reach a steady state, i.e., the system states
are stationary and the arrival rate is smaller than the service rate (cf. Fig. 9.2), the
average number of objects arriving in the system during a time period (e.g. 1 h or
1 day) are equal to the ones that are leaving the system during that time period.
Elegant in its simplicity, Little’s Law represents one of the basics in capacity

analysis. The following adapted example is related to the application of Little’s Law
in a manufacturing plant described by Bozarth and Handﬁeld (2013).
Consider an application of the Little’s Law to inventory and lead time analysis in
a manufacturing system (Fig. 9.3).
The upper part of Fig. 9.3 presents the dynamics of incoming and outgoing orders
in a manufacturing system. At point of time 1, two orders arrive in the system and the
number of jobs in the system, i.e., the inventory L(t) is 2 at t ¼ 1. At t ¼ 2, one more
order arrives and ﬁrst two orders are still processed. Therefore, L(t) ¼ 2 at t ¼ 2. At
t ¼ 3, two new orders arrive and the ﬁrst order exit the system. Therefore, L(t) ¼ 4 at
t ¼ 3. This inventory dynamics is shown in the bottom part of Fig. 9.3. Moreover, the
upper part of Fig. 9.3. shows lead time (sj – cj) for each job, where sj is the

Fig. 9.3 Inventory and lead time dynamics analysis

262

9 Factory Planning and Process Design

Fig. 9.4 Major components of the waiting line and Little’s Law model

completion time of the job and cj is the start time of job processing. For example,
lead time for the job no. 1 is two time units.
Finally, we merge the previous discussions on the waiting line theory and the
Little’s Law (Fig. 9.4).
Four major events, i.e., arrival of a customer order in the manufacturing system
queue, production start, production end, and the customer order delivery build the
framework of the analysis. The time interval in between the ﬁrst and the last event is
called lead time. Waiting time is the time interval in between the ﬁrst and the second
event. Flow time is the time interval in between the second and the third event.
During the waiting time, backlog costs and lost order costs occur. During the ﬂow
time, processing costs and WIP inventory costs is considered. The delivered orders
generate revenues and proﬁts.
Task 9.3 Little’s Law
Let us assume that in a car garage, two standard repairs are offered in a special
express service zone at extremely competitive prices. Batteries can be exchanged in
workstation 1 and oil is changed in workstation 2. Prior to this, customers need to
register and they also receive a general car inspection. Then they are assigned to
either station 1 or 2 depending on the repair that is required (either battery or oil
service). As shown in Fig. 9.5, 200 customers per day arrive at that garage.

• As stated, all customers are passing through the general inspection where in
average 20 cars are in the system for inspection.
• Sixty percent of clients request an oil service, and the average inventory is
seven cars.
• The other 40% want their batteries to be exchanged, and the average inventory is
three cars.
Looking at this scenario, we can calculate the following metrics:
The waiting time W for the general inspection is
W ¼ L/λ ¼ (20 cars inventory in inspection)/(200 customer cars per day) ¼
0.1 day in general inspection ¼ 48 min waiting time, if we assume that the company
operates 8 h (¼ 480 min) per day.
We can observe that 120 cars receive an oil service per day, and on average there
are seven cars in the oil service area. Applying the same calculation principle as
before, this leads us to the waiting time for the oil service of:
W ¼ L/λ ¼ (7 cars inventory in oil service)/(120 cars per day) ¼ 0.0583 per
day ¼ 28 min waiting time for a day with 480 min working time.
But we also have a total of 80 cars per day that will receive a new battery. On
average, there are just three cars in the inventory. Taking the formula according to
Little’s Law, this leads us to the waiting time for the battery exchange of:
W ¼ L/λ ¼ 3 cars inventory in oil service)/(80 cars per day) ¼ 0.0375 per
day ¼ 18 min of waiting time for a day with 480 min working time.
What is the waiting time for the cars receiving either an oil service or a new
battery? In total, the cars require 48 min for the general inspection + 28 min for the
oil service ¼ 76 min of waiting time. In the case of the general inspection plus
installation of a new battery, it is 48 min + 18 min ¼ 66 min of waiting time.
As we have learned from that example, the simple but powerful “Little’s Law”
formula can be used for just one single process, but can also be applied for a multiprocess-step transformation system.

264

9 Factory Planning and Process Design

Learning take away on Little’s law
One can also use that simple formula for the quick assessment of a manufacturing
facility, for example in connection with a rapid plant assessment (RPA). During a
plant tour, simply consider Eq. (9.15). If you ask during a visit to the factory what is
the average throughput rate per day and what is the throughput time, you can simply
calculate the average inventory that is carried. On the other hand, if you are an
operations manager in a factory and you know Little’s Law, you should try to
identify the key drivers for the throughput time, i.e. the key processes with their
durations that cause delays or prolong the throughput time. Try to understand these
and try to identify actions to reduce these delaying factors. The overall idea is to keep
the same output throughput rate, but to reduce the throughput time in order to bring
down the inventory carried. If inventory is not a concern for the company, but the
achievement of a higher output per day is the priority, a throughput time reduction
will also help here. If inventory remains stable and throughput time can be reduced
as a consequence, the throughput rate will increase. That means we can produce
more, and that is the reason why Little’s Law is also connected to management of
capacity.
Discussion Points
• Where else could you think about applying the simple formula of “Little’s Law”?
Think about usage in a manufacturing environment but also in a service
environment.
• Consider yourself being in the position of manager of an insurance company and
you would like to increase customer satisfaction by promising to all customers
that everyone would be served within 15 min of arrival. How could “Little’s Law”
help you?
• If you would like to increase performance of the value added system, thus
reducing the throughput time, where would you prioritize your observations?

9.3.3

Bottleneck Analysis/Theory of Constraints

The bottleneck determines the capacity of the transformation system. To make it
more transparent, just assume that there is a product (e.g. a chair) that requires for
example four simple production steps (see Fig. 9.6):
Attach four
legs to the
body of the
chair

Install back
to the boby
of the chair

Paint the
chair and let
it dry

Install the
seat cushion

4 mins

3 mins

10 mins

3 mins

Fig. 9.6 Process chain

9.3 Capacity Planning

265

In this simpliﬁed production process, painting and drying requires the longest
duration as it requires 10 min per chair (10 min per chair/60 min per hour ¼ 0.167 h
per chair). Or putting it more simply, six chairs per hour can be painted and thus the
system capacity is six chairs as this is determined by the bottleneck. After the
identiﬁcation of the bottleneck (step 1), the operations manager’s tasks would be
to seek opportunities as to how this bottleneck time could be reduced.
Another frequently used term for bottleneck is constraint, as it is the process that
prevents the enterprise from achieving its objectives (Goldratt 1990). If we want to
produce ten chairs per hour, something needs to be done in order to limit the impact
of that constraint or bottleneck, the performance manager needs to ﬁnd a way (most
probably with the help of a manufacturing engineer) to reduce the bottleneck time
from 10 to just 6 min per chair. A possible solution might be to improve the spray
process or to use a different type of paint or to increase the temperature for the paint
to dry faster. That means a plan has to be created to mitigate the impact of the
constraint and to reduce the bottleneck time (step 2). The operations manager and the
manufacturing engineer are the dedicated resources that will need to work on the
implementation of the identiﬁed measures (step 3).
Furthermore, one should try to better balance the work and maybe try to do some
necessary preparatory work required for the painting, such as cleaning after the back
of the body of the chair was installed. If this is also done, we are trying to spread the
work from the bottleneck as well as to try to increase capability in related production
processes (step 4). If this has been successfully implemented, the performance
manager will start again to identify new constraints and bottlenecks as part of this
continuous search for improvements (step 5).

9.3.4

Drum, Buffer, Rope

The drum is the instrument responsible for the beat (beat rate or takt time) of the
production system. This can also be considered as the pace or production schedule
and thus provides information regarding the items that need to be produced per
time unit.
The buffer can also be considered as the inventory (or another type of resource) of
the system which allows the bottleneck to perform at the beat of the drum. The last
symbol is the rope. This is the means to exchange information or it enables necessary
communication between the different parties. It refers to the need to synchronize the
different elements or workstations in the system to operate in alignment and thus has
the function of sending signals.
Assume there is a motorway that has ﬁve lanes and at a particular location (e.g., a
bridge) it is narrowed to three lanes, then this is the capacity limitation or constraint,
as cars could only use these three lanes. According to the theory of constraints
(ToC), you only achieve an improvement or advantage when it is possible to
increase the capacity of the bottleneck. That means for our example that you can
only improve the system by creating a broader bridge with four or even ﬁve lanes.

266

9 Factory Planning and Process Design

The second principle of the ToC is that it does not improve the performance of the
system if you try to work on a non-bottleneck area. For our example, if you create a
better motorway with six lanes but you keep the old bridge with three lanes, this will
not improve the system, as the bottleneck remains the same.
The third principle says that the time that you spent at the bottleneck, the bridge in
our case, is lost. In real operations, you could try to mitigate the impact of the
bottleneck by using well trained staff or by putting in a strict management system to
lower the impact of the bottleneck. In a real factory the paint shop or a crane might be
a bottleneck. In the case of the crane, you might schedule its usage tightly and should
use a skilled crane operator who can maneuver goods with the highest precision, so
that the time consumed for picking the goods, moving them and to position them at
their destination is strictly limited.
We can summarize that bottleneck management and dealing with constraints is a
daily task for operations managers. Furthermore, a constraint will always exist and
due to expected or unexpected occurrences, new bottlenecks will arise (key people
leave the company, workers are sick or on strike, a machine breaks down, a supplier
cannot provide the parts. . .). Other drivers for bottlenecks could also be changing
product mixes, usage of a new technology and the training of people to create new
products using a new technology. Knowing and dealing with such constraints is part
of the day-to-day business in SCOM.

9.3.5

Break-Even Analysis

In the previous sections dealing with Little’s Law or the ToC, we looked only at
capacity without consideration of proﬁt and loss aspects. The break-even analysis is
an approach that also looks at costs, respectively revenues. Slack et al. (2010)
summarize that the break-even analysis is “the technique of comparing revenues
and costs at increasing levels of output in order to establish the point at which
revenue exceeds cost, that is, the point at which it ‘breaks even’”.
The break-even point is the point at which the total costs of the number of units
that need to be produced are equal to the total revenues that are generated (Krajewski
et al. 2013). That means that from a capacity point of view a ﬁrm needs to operate
above the break-even point, or graphically speaking on the right-hand side of that
point, as Fig. 9.7 depicts.
With the number of units that lead to a surplus on the revenue side, i.e., where the
revenues are higher than the cost, the company will enter the proﬁt zone. Below that
production volume, graphically speaking, the ﬁrm is running left from the breakeven point and thus is only generating losses, as the costs are higher than the
revenues.
Task 9.4 Break-Even-Point
Put yourself in the position of a production manager who needs to evaluate if it is
reasonable to purchase a new machine for the production of certain goods. The

underlying assumptions are that costs and revenues are linear functions and that we
know these exact costs. Furthermore, interest rates or cost of inventory is excluded
from our break-even analysis model. It will be your task to calculate the break-even
point in the number of units but also in terms of money, i.e., in $US.
Consider the following notations:
BPx represents the break-even point in units x
BP$ represents the break-even point in $US
p represents the price per unit
x represents the number of units produced
vc represents the variable costs
fc represents the ﬁxed costs.
Equation (9.16) is used to determine the total revenues (TR):
TR ¼ p  x

ð9:16Þ

Equation (9.17) is applied to determine the total cost (TC):
TC ¼ fc þ vc  x

ð9:17Þ

According to the deﬁnition of the break-even analysis, the break-even point is
reached when TRs are equal to TC. That means for you as the production manager,
you will need to set:
TR ¼ TC or considering the details from above we can use Eq. (9.18)
p  x ¼ fc þ vc  x
to identify the break-even point in units.
The break-even point in units thus equals [see Eq. (9.19)]:

ð9:18Þ

268

9 Factory Planning and Process Design

BPx ¼ fc=ðp  vcÞ

ð9:19Þ

To convert this into monetary values (e.g. $US), the result BPx needs to be
multiplied by the price per unit, i.e.
BP$ ¼ BPx  p ¼ ½fc=ðp  vcÞ  p ¼ fc  p=ðp  vcÞ

ð9:20Þ

Based upon Eq. (9.20), the proﬁt can also be calculated, because proﬁt
(simpliﬁed) equals TR–TC, which translates in Eq. (9.21):
Profit P ¼ TR  TC ¼ p  x  ðfc þ vc  xÞ

ð9:21Þ

Consider a numerical example. You received the following annual values from
your controlling department (see Table 9.2):
In order to calculate the break-even point in $US BP$, you will need to use
formula (9.6):
BP$ ¼ 20,000  5/[5  (1 + 2)] ¼ 100,000/2 ¼ 50,000$/year.
That means the break-even point in $US BP$ is reached, once the value of
$50,000 is exceeded. As a production manager, you would like to know the quantity
in units that needs to be produced to reach the break-even point in units BPx.
Therefore you now need to use formula (9.18):
BPx ¼ 20, 000=½5  ð1 þ 2Þ ¼ 20:000=2 ¼ 10, 000 units=year:
Of course, the break-even point in $US is directly linked by the sales price per
unit with the break-even point in units, as you can easily see in the example above.
You can simply test the result by taking the BPx (which is equal to 10,000 units in
our task) and multiply it by the selling price (which is here equal to $5/unit). The
result is 10,000 units  $5/unit ¼ $50,000, as calculated above.
"

Practical Insights In practice, the break-even point in $US is more relevant for the sales or the controlling department, whereas the break-even
point in units “talks” more appropriately to the managers responsible for
production, purchasing or logistics. This is because of the fact that
production or logistics managers need to consider not only the size or
weight of the products in order to determine space requirements on the
production floor or in the warehouse, but also to identify the correct
lifting or transportation devices. That means that the break-even analysis
is a simple calculation method that provides a rich variety of people
inside the organization with information essential for their purposes.

Decision Trees

In practice, market uncertainty and such factors as production cost, demand, prices,
inﬂation or exchange rates inﬂuences managerial decisions. Should we expand our
production or not, is it a proﬁtable choice to redevelop the old distribution centre if
demand for the following years is uncertain or should we sign the long-term contract
with our supplier if we do not know if customers like our new product?
Decision tree analysis helps to make decisions in uncertain environments. A
decision tree helps to build a graphic overview of possible strategies and to calculate
in simple steps the revenue, cost and expected monetary value of several
opportunities. Decision tree analysis offers a combination of strategic decisions,
such as expanding a production site or not, and ﬁnancial planning. It evaluates
strategic decisions by its proﬁtability to support the decision-making process. For
that reason it can help to make decisions and aid design of processes and networks.
Task 9.5 Decision Tree Analysis
A company thinks about expanding their production site because they assume a
favourable market development. To calculate expected monetary value (EMV) we
have to consider probability P for both a favourable (0.35) and an unfavourable
(0.65) market development. Option A means a large expansion, option B—a
medium expansion, option C—a small expansion, and option D—no expansion.
At the end of the tree you can see the cost or gain of each opportunity (Fig. 9.8)
To calculate the EMV we have to use Eq. (9.22):
EMV ¼ Pð favorableÞ  gain þ PðinfavorableÞ  losses

ð9:22Þ

Using Eq. (9.22) it becomes possible to decide which expansion would be the
most proﬁtable:
Fig. 9.8 Decision tree

EMV ðAÞ ¼ 0:35  100, 000 € þ 0:65  ð80; 000 €Þ ¼ 10, 000 €
EMV ðBÞ ¼ 0:35  75, 000 € þ 0:65  ð25; 000 €C Þ ¼ 10, 000 €
EMV ðC Þ ¼ 0:35  30, 000 € þ 0:65  ð3000 €Þ ¼ 8550 €
EMV ðDÞ ¼ 0 €
We can observe that medium expansion would be the best decision from the
ﬁnancial point of view, in a case where market development will be similarly
predicted. Option D, no expansion, would lead to no difference because the company
would not be changing anything.
"

Practical Insights It is important in decision tree analysis to identify all
factors that influence cost and to decide which factors are uncertain in
the calculation. The critical issue is how to assess probability for relevant
uncertain factors and consider their influence. Moreover, a company
should not focus only on financial analysis. Other factors may also be
important and the financial part can only be a fraction of the decisionmaking process. In practice, decision tree analysis is frequently
supported by the development of business cases for possible future
expansion.

Discussion Questions
• Why do you think capacity management is important for globally active
companies that have a large production network with multiple production sites?
• Why is capacity management very important from a strategic point of view?
• What are the consequences when it is identiﬁed that the existing capacity of a ﬁrm
is too high as opposed to when it is too low? What are the corrective measures that
you would suggest to adjust the existing available capacity so that it can meet
future demand?
• Is it the right strategy to aim for almost 100% capacity utilization, or do you think
one should also consider some idle capacity for the unpredictable?

Simulation: Case Study AnyLogic

Problem Description
Centrotherm Photovoltaics AG is a global supplier of technology and equipment for
the photovoltaics, semiconductor and microelectronics industries. The company
needed to identify the best automated production line and factory conﬁguration to
minimize costs and maximize throughput and reliability. Special focus was to:
• determine the type and amount of equipment required to fulﬁl production plans;
• evaluate layout alternatives to improve the throughput and utilization rate;
• inspect possible bottlenecks in the material ﬂow;

evaluate the impact of operator behaviour on factory output;
test the consequences of maintenance within various time frames;
identify system behaviour in case of breakdowns;
identify scrap probability;
evaluate change of performance during planned downtimes.

Model Development
The consultants used AnyLogic simulation and modelling technology to provide the
answers to these problems. Using AnyLogic Professional’s ability to create and save
custom object libraries, the consultants encapsulated their vast simulation experience
in the photovoltaic and semiconductor manufacturing industries and created their
own libraries, which they reused in many projects, including this one.
Solution Development
These libraries featured elements built on top of the AnyLogic model development
environment and allowed the consultants to easily model different kinds of equipment, material handling systems inside factories, personnel, and production control
systems, all speciﬁc to the photovoltaic and semiconductor industries. In the
Centrotherm project, this solution helped modellers quickly reproduce various
aspects of the client’s production system behaviour.
Testing the Solution
Once the model was built, the experimental phase of the project began. The
consultants tested many parameters to ﬁnd the best solutions. The input data,
which included layout conﬁgurations and various parameters, was taken directly
from Excel and Access ﬁles. Each simulation run reproduced 1 year of factory
operation.
First, the consultants experimented with the overall production line design, using
parameter variation and optimization. They tested many parameters, including those
concerning capacity and the number of various pieces of equipment, cassettes, bins,
etc., to see which conﬁgurations would work best in terms of throughput, reliability
and scrap rate. Then the consultants worked to optimize transportation policies,
buffer zone allocation, and watermark control processes.
Analysing the Results
Some of the proposed layout variants were rejected during this stage due to their
poor performance. Finally, the few resulting solutions were tested manually to
investigate the beneﬁts and drawbacks of each one, and to ﬁnd out how they could
be further improved.
Implementation
The solutions proposed provided Centrotherm Photovoltaics AG with the opportunity to signiﬁcantly improve the production line design and choose the best solution
in terms of throughput, reliability and scrap rate at a low cost. Additionally, at the
end of the project, the model was released to the client so that it could be used for

272

9 Factory Planning and Process Design

analysis of future changes in the factory. The model allows the customer to carry out
their own experiments, playing with parameters and layout, changing input data, etc.
This manufacturing facility simulation model will serve as a decision support tool at
the factory for a long time to come.

9.4

Process Flow Structures

It is intuitively clear that not all products are produced in the same way. In order to
enlarge on this for you, we need to think through another hypothetical case, in which
you would be the producer and the product would be a chair. It is a very simple
example, but makes it easy to grasp the underlying ideas and concepts.

9.4.1

Job Shop

Just put yourself into the situation that you plan to produce your own little chair for
your room or for your apartment. You would go to the closest do-it-yourself centre,
would buy some pieces of wood, some nails and your favourite colour of paint
(e.g. red). These are the materials you would need for the chair. Furthermore, you
need some tools, maybe a brush, a saw and a hammer. These standard tools and your
materials plus your creativity and manual work are everything that you require in
order to build your own, fully individualized piece of furniture (maybe you would
produce and assemble it in your kitchen or in the garage).
The result would be an absolutely unique product and nobody else would have
the same one! Maybe one of your friends will ask you to produce a second one, but
with some changes regarding the size and also regarding the colour (your friend
wants to have a bigger chair, painted in green). With your equipment, you would also
be able to create such a product for your friend.
What we have just described is a typical set-up of the so-called “job shop” process
ﬂow structure. The secret behind it is that with such a process ﬂow structure,
absolutely unique products are made under the usage of standard tools in very low
quantities. Also, the manual effort is quite high, in respect of the automation level,
which is in general very low.
As you produced it manually and bought only a small amount of material, the unit
price is quite high, but so is the ﬂexibility to adjust your production set-up and to
meet changing requirements. If you followed carefully the hypothetical wooden
chair example from above, you will now understand that a job shop is a process ﬂow
structure that is used in order to create products at very low volume (just this one
chair for you and the adjusted one for your friend). At the same time, we can
understand that the job shop is suitable for creating products with great variation.
It is obvious that, even with this very unusual and hypothetical example, we still
have developed the concept of the “job shop”. In reality, this is used for the creation

9.4 Process Flow Structures

273

of e.g. replacement teeth, medical eye-glasses or maybe exclusively styled
motorcycles or exclusively tuned cars. Another example is the traditional tailor
who produces a dress or suit exclusively for you. These are all individual products
with great variety and very low volume.

9.4.2

Batch Shop

Now let us continue with the hypothetical example of our chair, made out of wood.
Let us assume that you would go to a market in order to sell your products. While
you are selling and people come to you stating that they would like to have the small
chair and the big one with arm rests in various colours, the result would be increasing
the volume of similar types of products that need to be created.
Most probably, the best idea would be that you would offer two standard chairs
(a small one and a big one) that could be painted in ﬁve different colours, for
example. Because of that selected product portfolio, the natural reaction would be
that you would produce a certain lot size of the small and then another lot size of the
bigger one. As products are processed in lots or batches, this ﬂow structure is called
batch processing or batch production (i.e., products are produced in a batch shop). In
the last production step, you would then do the customization, i.e., the individual
painting on the market using a spray can.
Again, right now let us switch back to reality. Of course, not only exclusive suits
are produced as you know, but also other exclusive products in small series like
agricultural or construction machines respectively, helicopters or ambulances. In
these cases, batches of similar products would be created. For example, the producer
of special construction equipment would produce a small series of 20 excavators,
which would all have the same communication equipment on board and would all be
painted in blue for a speciﬁc customer and bearing the company’s logo. The idea is to
reduce the impact of set-up times and set-up cost and also to introduce stability into
the value creation process.

9.4.3

Assembly Line

Let us continue the hypothetical chair journey. Your chairs are superb, everyone in
your neighbourhood loves them and now even shops ask you to produce them in
higher quantities. That means the required volume is signiﬁcantly increasing and the
consequence is, that for example manually cutting the wood for the chairs and
running a manual assembly would no longer be efﬁcient.
The consequence then might be to look at the possible usage of more machines
for cutting the wood, drilling holes, putting the parts together, painting and even
packaging them. So we would consider higher machine utilization and even think
about more automation. Furthermore, we would think about the deﬁnition of work

274

9 Factory Planning and Process Design

packages or focus on work specialization (cutting, drilling. . .), leading to the
identiﬁcation of work stations in the value creation process. In order to ensure the
constant product ﬂow, the different stations would also need to be balanced to avoid
idle times. The product being created moves at a deﬁned takt time from station to
station. This is also referred to as the product following a deﬁned pacing through the
work stations. In an ideal case, one would employ a conveyor belt or similar for the
movement of the product throughout the production facility.
And this is what is applied in the real world. Assembly lines are used for mass
production of articles with relatively high volumes and a well deﬁned level of
variants. The most known examples of products created on an assembly line are
cars (e.g., Henry Ford’s assembly line for mass produced automobiles of the famous
T-Model). Other examples produced on assembly lines are household devices such
as washing machines, refrigerators or microwave ovens, but also consumer goods
electronics like TVs or computers. All these have in common that the item produced
is made in large volume and is moving at a constant speed through the factory from
work station to work station. This makes the production quite efﬁcient, but it is also
vulnerable if a station may not be working or the wrong (or no) parts have been
supplied to the station. The result could be a stopping line.
Task 9.6 Assembly Line Balancing
The planner in charge of assembly line balancing requires some inputs. One fundamental input is the manufacturing bill of materials (BoM) that provides the necessary
information regarding the composition of the single parts that will be assembled in
order to create the ﬁnal product. To ensure this, the logical sequence of the different
steps (so called precedence relation) also needs to be known (just imagine the
sequence in which a pizza is created: ﬁrst comes the dough, then the tomato sauce,
followed by mushrooms, then the cheese, then it is placed in the oven, etc.).
Additionally, the task times for different activities have to be known along with
demand and available capacity per period of time.
Let us look at the example of how to assemble a simple manual scooter. You are
in charge of balancing the assembly line according to the following inputs from the
manufacturing engineers (Table 9.3):

Step 1: Precedence Diagram
The ﬁrst step is to create the so-called “precedence diagram” based upon the inputs
received. Table 9.3 indicates the precedence relationships and the corresponding
diagram can be created. A simpliﬁed illustration is shown in Fig. 9.9:
Step 2: Identify the Number of Followers
According to the precedence diagram, we can identify the number of the following
activities. Just count the respective following tasks. This is needed to apply
heuristics for the later assignment of the tasks to workstations (WS).
•
•
•
•
•
•

Activity A has 5 followers.
Activities B and D have 4 followers.
Activities C and E have 3 followers.
Activity F has 2 followers.
Activity G has 1 follower.
Activity H has 0 followers.

Step 3 Deﬁning the Assignment Heuristic
We will apply the heuristic to start the loading of the assembly line beginning with
the activity that has the highest number of the following activities. The precedence
diagram needs to be respected. If there are activities that have the same number of the
followers, the one with the higher number of task times will be used.
"

Practical Insights Heuristics can be applied to obtain a reasonable result,
but sometimes it might be required to review and re-do the exercise in
case that the heuristic might not lead to a satisfactory result. In addition
to the heuristic presented here (Jacobs and Aquilano 2014), Heizer and
Render (2014) suggest further heuristics, but these are not considered for
our example. In real business, more sophisticated mathematical methods
are used which are supported by software. These methods allow considering different cases with parallel machines, uncertain processing times,
etc. (Dolgui and Proth 2010)

Step 4: Identify the Bottleneck Activity and Determine Maximal
Production Rate
In our example, the activity “D” has the longest processing time of 2.5 min. This
activity is also considered as the bottleneck and determines maximal production rate.

276

9 Factory Planning and Process Design

Let’s assume that we work 8 h per day in our scooter manufacturing facility.
Considering 60 min per hour, we get
available production time per day of 8 h/day  60 min/h ¼ 480 min/day
In order to identify maximal production rate per day, we need to divide the
available production time per day by the bottleneck time. In our example, this is
calculated as follows
Max. production rate ¼ (480 min /day)/(2.5 min /product) ¼ 192 products/day
Step 5: Calculate the Takt Time Based on the Required Output
Let’s assume, that we have to balance our assembly line for a production rate per day
of 150 scooters. In this case, we need to divide the available production time per day
by the required output. We get:
Takt time ¼ (480 min /day)/(150 scooters/day) ¼ 3.2 min /scooter
Step 6: Calculate Theoretical Minimal Number of Workstations
As it can be observed from Table 9.3, the sum of the task times equals 11.6 min. Takt
time is 3.2 min/scooter. That means we need to distribute the total task time over
several workstations. This is exactly the task right now. In order to identify the
minimum number of WS, we divide the total task time by the identiﬁed takt time:
Min number of WS ¼ (11.6 min /scooter)/(3.2 min /scooter/WS) ¼ 3.63 WS
As we cannot have fragments of WS, we need to round up. That means for our
example that at least four WSs will need to be considered.
Step 7: Loading the Workstations According to Step 3
Workstation 1
3.2 min – A (1.5 min) ¼ 1.7 min
1.7 min – B (1.0 min) ¼ 0.7 min (¼ remaining idle time)
Workstation 2
3.2 min – D (2.5 min) ¼ 0.7 min
0.7 min – E (0.6 min) ¼ 0.1 min (¼ remaining idle time)
Workstation 3
3.2 min – C (1.8 min) ¼ 1.4 min
1.4 min – F (1.3 min) ¼ 0.1 min (¼ remaining idle time)
Workstation 4
3.2 min – G (1.5 min) ¼ 1.7 min
1.7 min  H (1.4 min) ¼ 0.3 min (¼ remaining idle time)
The clustering of the activities per workstations (WS) is shown in Fig. 9.10.

9.4 Process Flow Structures

277

Figure 9.11 illustrates the clustering of the tasks per workstations well, but it does
not provide a good overview on the takt time and efﬁciency of the assembly line.
Therefore, stacked bar charts are used in practice which demonstrate the loading per
station including the corresponding idle time. In Fig. 9.11, the corresponding stacked
bar chart is presented. In practice this is also called Yamazumi chart (“Yama” means
mountain and “zumi” means to pile up in Japanese). Thus it is a graphical interpretation of the piled up work per station.
Step 8: Calculate the Efﬁciency of the Assembly Line
In the last step, the efﬁciency of the newly balanced assembly line will need to be
determined. As the stacked bar chart (Yamazumi) shows (Fig. 9.9), there are idle

times on each of the WSs, which results in inefﬁciency. The planners of the assembly
line will try to ﬁnd the ways to reduce these inefﬁciencies in numerous iterations. If
we consider the loading of our assembly line for the scooters, we can calculate the
efﬁciency using Eq. (9.23):
Efficiency ½% ¼ total task times=ðtakt time  number of workstationsÞ ð9:23Þ
For our example, efﬁciency [%] ¼ 11.6 min/(3.2 min  4) ¼ 11.6 min/12.8
min ¼ 0.906 which means 91%.
The planners would now try to break down the individual tasks into smaller
portions in order to reduce the idle times and increase efﬁciency.

9.4.4

Continuous Flow

Now should demand for chairs be very high, i.e., many thousand items per day
required, one would even rethink the chair’s design and materials. The questions are
how could we simplify the design in order to reduce the number of parts and as well as
the throughput time of assembly? That means, one could argue, that the product
should no longer be made out of wood, but maybe out of plastics. Instead of cutting
pieces of wood, putting them together on the assembly line and then painting them,
one could suggest that the chair is done in one continuous outﬂow of plastics in
various colours. Production would take place following the plastics moulding process.
Instead of having multiple workstations, the process would take place in one
continuous ﬂow, a value-added process starting with the ﬁlling of the plastics
granulate, heating it up, pressing it into the form required, cooling it and then
removing it from the mould. Human intervention would be involved for supervision
of the machines and to ensure quality, but creation of the product would be achieved
through utilization of machines, using the highest automation. The cost per product
would remain relatively low, but on the other hand, the cost for the facility and
machines would be very high, because of the enormously high level of automation.
Furthermore, complete customization is not possible because the moulds are especially designed to create one product and thus are very expensive. This will result in
very low ﬂexibility for adjusting the product to possible changes from the
customer side.

9.4.5

Product-Process Matrix

In essence, the considered product ﬂow structures have different advantages as well
as disadvantages. The relationship between products and processes can be
summarized in the form of a so-called product-process matrix (see Fig. 9.12).
Let us get back to the initial hypothetical example of our chair. If you want to
produce your chair exclusively and in small quantities, you will select the job shop;
if on the other hand the task is to produce the chair in the highest quantities, the

9.5 Lean Production Systems

279

Fig. 9.12 Product-process matrix [based on Chase et al. (2006)]

continuous ﬂow would be a recommended structure. Overall, the question of volume
and variety are the factors that will drive your decision towards the most appropriate
process ﬂow structure.

9.5

Lean Production Systems

9.5.1

Lean Thinking

“Lean” means the continuous process of increasing efﬁciency and improvements in
the organization, which requires teamwork, respect and taking over responsibility.
Team members are also responsible for detecting defects and striving for their root
cause, plus identifying a solution for future avoidance. Lean also requires a good
relationship with the unions accompanied by the trust.
The lean organization is characterized by a set of the following ﬁve key principles
(Womack and Jones 1996; Bicheno and Holweg 2008):

280

value from the customer point of view
value stream and waste (“muda”) elimination
smooth ﬂow throughput in production
pull-control policies, e.g., Kanban
perfection and continuous improvement (Kaizen).

The underlying philosophy of all above mentioned principles is the respect for
people and learning from mistakes.

9.5.1.1 Value
Identifying the ‘value’ of a product or service means understanding and specifying
what the customer is expecting to receive. Understanding what the customer wants
and does not want are key aspects in lean thinking. Womack and Jones (2005)
described value as a capability provided for a customer at the right time at an
appropriate price, as deﬁned in each case by the customer.
9.5.1.2 Value Stream and Value Stream Mapping
The value stream presents the speciﬁc activities required to design, order and
provide a speciﬁc product, from concept to launch, order to delivery, raw materials
into the hands of the customer. The most effective process is achieved by performing
the minimal required number of value-added steps and no waste steps. This is the
ideal goal that is almost impossible to achieve in practice. A method to maximize the
volume of the value-added steps in lean practice is called value stream mapping and
analysis.
VSA (value stream analysis) is a tool to connect process ﬂow and costs analysis.
It is a suitable tool for redesigning the value creation systems. The availability of a
well-trained team is essential as a key success factor. In VSA, different process steps
in the value creation process are identiﬁed, listed, sequenced and visualized. Then
the value-added times are measured. For comparison the non-value added times are
also measured.
Value stream mapping (VSM) provides understanding of the current process by:
• visualizing multiple process levels
• highlighting waste and its sources,
• rendering “hidden” decision points apparent.
VSM also provides a communication tool for stimulating ideas by capturing
critical organizational knowledge and identifying locations for data gathering and
process measurement.

9.5.1.3 Flow
Womack and Jones (2005) described ﬂow as “the progressive achievement of tasks
along the value stream so that a product proceeds from design to launch, order to
delivery, and raw materials into the hands of the customer with no stoppages, scrap
or backﬂows”. The concept of ﬂow is focused on the movement and value adding

9.5 Lean Production Systems

281

processes of the product as such but also involves the material, information and
ﬁnancial ﬂow. The ﬂow principle can also be extended to the non-production area
where it is related to information ﬂow. The ﬂow of information among the parties
involved in a value creation network is as important as the physical ﬂow of the
materials.

9.5.1.4 Pull
The “pull” principle considers a system from downstream to upstream activities in
which nothing is produced by the upstream supplier until the downstream customer
signals a need. Pull means that one should start the creation of a product or service
when the customer asks for it.
9.5.1.5 Seek Perfection
Seeking perfection is the element of continuous improvement in the lean philosophy.
Perfection does not only mean quality. Perfection should be considered as being able
to create exactly what the customer wants, when it is needed and at an acceptable,
fair price with a minimum of waste. It is important to understand that a process will
not be perfect and that there is a need for continuous re-examination of the process to
remain competitive and lean. It is required to repeat this optimization cycle to get
closer to the optimum with every loop taken. Womack and Jones (2005) summarized
perfection as “the complete elimination of muda so that all activities along the value
stream create value”.

9.5.2

Lean Production Principles

For an all-embracing view on the origin of Lean, please consider “The Machine that
Changed the World” by Womack et al. (2007). Insights on the important Just-inTime (JIT) principle are provided in Sect. 5.3.3 and various practical Lean shop-ﬂoor
examples are presented in Sect. 10.2.
In 1950, Eiji Toyoda, a member of the Toyoda family who founded the Toyota
Motor Company, visited Ford’s Rouge factory in Detroit. From 1937 to 1950,
i.e. over a period of 13 years, Toyota produced in total 2685 cars in contrast to
7000 automobiles that Ford produced at the Rouge site in a single day (Womack
et al. 1990). Eiji Toyoda assessed in detail the mass production principles applied in
Detroit and concluded that the performance of the Toyota facilities could also be
improved and he exchanged information on that with Taiichi Ohno, Toyota’s
leading production engineer in Nagoya. Even the Japanese considered the Toyota
staff as “a bunch of farmers”, initially producing looms, then military trucks and
some hand-crafted automobiles—but today, the company is recognized as being one
of the most efﬁcient and highest-quality producers of motor vehicles in the world.

9.5.2.1 Lean Production/Toyota Production System
As a result of the research at the MIT International Motor Vehicle Program (IMVP)
the expression ‘lean production’ was coined and Holweg (2007, p. 426) points out,

282

9 Factory Planning and Process Design

that: “The term ‘lean production’ was ﬁrst used by Krafcik in 1988, and subsequently, Womack et al. of course used the term ‘lean production’ to contrast Toyota
with the Western ‘mass production’ system in the ‘Machine’ book.”
Ohno (1988) identiﬁed that the U.S. mass production principles would not be
applicable for the craft production oriented Japanese industry. Thus he created a new
approach. In the western industries, multiple machines were used, and each one had
to produce enormous amounts of the same pressed parts, as the changeover required
specialists and took a lot of time.
Taiichi Ohno developed presses, in which the dies were slid in (every couple of
hours instead of months) via rollers and ﬁxed by simple quick mechanisms to use
few machines to press with multiple dies. This saved time, cost, and space. Also
instead of using specialist changeover teams, Taiichi Ohno suggested that the
workers should be capable of and responsible for running the exchange of dies;
after continuous efforts on improvement, changeover times were reduced down to
just 3 min by the end of the 1950s. He also identiﬁed that it was more cost efﬁcient to
press small lot sizes of parts instead of running press batches of large quantities,
resulting in (a) a reduction in carried inventories and (b) immediate identiﬁcation of
defective pressed metal sheets.
The result was an increased awareness regarding quality and early identiﬁcation
of ﬂaws. It also avoided large quantities of wrongly produced parts that would have
needed to be repaired, reworked or even scrapped—if they had followed the system
of producing large batches according to the mass production philosophy. In order to
further perfect this approach, no stupid exchangeable de-humanized workers would
be required but instead a set of highly skilled, motivated and pro-active workforce!
Toyota also suffered from the ﬁnancial crisis when it was subject to post-war
American occupation. Toyota intended to lay off 25% of their workforce, which
resulted in turmoil leading to the strengthened rights of employees and strong
unions. The compromise was that the workforce was reduced by a quarter, but
President Kiichiro Toyoda resigned and the remaining workers received a life-time
working guarantee at Toyota accompanied by seniority-based wages and receipt of
bonus payments. In other words, the employees became part of the Toyota community with the right to use the available facilities.
Ohno understood that because of this agreement, workers could remain at Toyota
for life. Toyota and the workers became ‘one community’. So he intended to strive
for continuous improvement of their skills and competencies as they became part of
the “human assets”. This needs to be seen in contrast to Ford’s perception of using
the workers as “human equipment” to perform one or two tasks repeatedly,
supervised by a foreman, managed by industrial engineers and so on along the
hierarchy. This also contributes to the establishment of a lean culture (Mann 2010).
One striking ﬁnding for Ohno was that in Ford’s approach, cars would be moved
along the line, even when there were defects, because these were corrected in an
especially dedicated rework area before being shipped to dealers. Back in Japan,
Taiichi Ohno formed teams of skilled workers, led by a capable team leader. The
team leader was manager and worker at the same time and was also utilized as a
“jumper” to ﬁll in the gap of an absent team colleague. These teams were

9.5 Lean Production Systems

283

furthermore autonomously responsible for numerous assembly processes and for a
certain area in the plant, so to say, their working domain. They were also responsible
for quality control, housekeeping and cleaning as well as conducting small repairs. A
key element of the teams was continuous process optimization—the teams were at
the frontline, so they felt the pain and knew how to improve things.

9.5.2.2 Kaizen
This approach of continuous improvement is called “Kaizen” in Japanese (Imai
1993). MacDufﬁe et al. (1996) summarized that “under the philosophy of continuous
improvement that characterized lean production, problems identiﬁed through the
minimization of buffers are seen as opportunities for organizational learning”. In
contrast to mass production in the western world, where mistakes or parts installed
incorrectly would move throughout the entire line and by the time mistakes had
possibly been identiﬁed, many faulty cars would have been created, Taiichi Ohno
did something completely different. Ohno made another simple, but revolutionary,
invention. He attached a cord to the assembly line and workers were encouraged to
pull the cord, thus stopping the entire assembly line if a mistake was identiﬁed by a
worker (Ohno 1988). Then the workers in their community looked for a solution to
the problem, which gave them a lot of responsibility in making sure to do it right the
ﬁrst time.
9.5.2.3 Waste Reduction
In order to convert to lean principles in other functions of the organization, such a
process can also be implemented in non-production processes: the cord or andon1
sign is there to highlight mistakes when they appear (Dennis 2010).
Ohno also tried to assess the reason for mistakes occurring by asking the “Five
Whys”, which is a structured approach to get to the so-called “root cause” of
problems (Ohno 1988). Initially the assembly lines stopped very often, but the
more mature this error analysis and prevention attitude became, the more failure
rates dropped signiﬁcantly to almost no defects: this is a 100% yield at Toyota
compared to 90% in the mass production plants. This is the reason why in today’s
Toyota plants there is almost no space planned for rework, because there is almost no
rework compared to today’s mass production plants which devote 20% of their space
to quality corrections. Close to the waste reduction idea is also the Six Sigma concept
that set up special requirements on quality management and control (Chiarini 2012).
Waste, or muda, can be classiﬁed in two ways.
• Type I Muda is found in activities that add no value for the customer, but are
necessary, to deliver the product.
Andon is Japanese and means “lantern” and thus is a visual, such as a trafﬁc light that highlights in
the production process anything going according to plan (green ¼ OK) or if there are problems/
disturbances (red ¼ NOK) that would require immediate intervention and mitigation.

284

9 Factory Planning and Process Design

• Type II Muda is found in activities that do not create value and can be eliminated
immediately, such as waiting and unnecessary transport.
Type 1 muda needs to be reduced to the minimum and type II muda needs to be
eliminated.
This list of 7 + 1 wastes is one of the key elements in Lean Thinking. Womack
and Jones (2005) stated that Taiichi Ohno’s original enumeration of the wastes was
commonly found in production. The term “seven plus one” wastes comes from the
fact that initially, seven wastes were identiﬁed, but then it became obvious that not
meeting the requirements of the customer was also waste, hence “7 + 1”:
• Over-production ahead of demand
• Waiting for the next processing step
• Unnecessary transport of materials (for example between villages, suppliers,
facilities etc.)
• Over-processing of parts due to e.g. poor tool and/or product design
• Inventory that exceeds what is required
• Unnecessary motion and movement by the employees during the performance of
their work (for example looking for parts, tools, documentation etc.)
• Production of defective parts plus
• Not meeting customer requirements
Recently, wasted ideas or knowledge waste has been added to “7 + 1” (Dennis
2010). The Toyota’s case clearly demonstrates how aspects of the process ﬂow
structures, layout and factory planning and the evolution from craft to lean production are connected. Furthermore, it has shown that the principles of continuous
improvement and thinking in terms of quality are all closely connected. It has also
shown its initial limitations, for example the need for a total system view regarding
the lean enterprise and the intensive need for cooperation with the SC partners
involved (no matter if they are internal or external).
To summarize the principles of lean production, it can be stated that lean strives
for the combination of the advantages of both craft and mass production, trying to
avoid the high unit cost of craftsmanship and at the same time avoiding the rigid,
boring and inﬂexible processes of mass production. This has led to the ability to
reduce costs per unit and has dramatically improved quality while at the same time
being able to provide a wider range of products to the customer and more challenging work for the staff. Regarding composition of workers’ teams, lean production is
striving for the creation of ﬂexible teams consisting of multi-skilled staff that
operates highly ﬂexible machines to produce volumes of products in high variety.
These principles are applied to the tiers of suppliers, but are also looking at an
integration of dealers and buyers into the lean concept.
To summarize, the Toyota Production System covers in principle the following
key areas (see also Heizer and Render 2014, p. 661):
1. Pull-System: Parts are only produced, when they are needed for further production. This is the contrary to a Push-System, in which material is fed into the

production area or warehouse. The purpose of the pull principle is, e.g., to
increase efﬁciency and to avoid overproduction, unnecessary transportation and
too high levels of inventory.
Just in Time (JIT): Following the Pull-System, parts and modules are delivered
to the station in the right quantity and at the right time (thus just in time), when
they are needed. It is to avoid, that the facility is ﬂooded with unnecessary
material.
Kanban: Kanban means a “sign” or a “card”. A Kanban signal is used to indicate
that a small batch of components needs to be produced. It is a practical approach
based on real material consumption that initiates the replenishment process
(unlike as material requirements planning (MRP) that presumes the planned
replenishments).
Standard Work Practices: These are agreed upon documented procedures for
the production process. This is to secure that everyone follows the same steps
and sequence in the value creation. Thus, the timing per operation will be met
and the quality to complete the work will be the same for all similar products.
Minimal Machines: Proprietary machines are designed for speciﬁc Toyota
applications. It might also be a good idea to use general multi-purpose machines
with certain adapters to simplify the usage and to ease the maintenance.
Respect for People: The employees are treated and are also respected as capable
workers with knowledge and they are empowered to use their capabilities.
Empowered employees: The employees have responsibility. For example, they
can stop the production in urgent cases, might evaluate improvement ideas and
are also actively involved in quality control circles.
Kaizen Area: This is an area, where the employees are involved in order to make
suggestions. Furthermore, the ideas or suggestions are tested, discussed and
evaluated.
Jidoka: Machines are equipped with built-in devices for the monitoring of
performance and to “make judgements”. If a problem occurs, the machine will
interrupt the process, that’s why Jidoka is also considered as machines or
automation with “human touch”. This avoids a processing of defective
components and allows to analyse the root causes of the defects.
Andon System: Initially, in case of a problem a cord was pulled or a light was
ﬂashing at a station. Nowadays, problems are also openly displayed on a board
or a screen in order to highlight deviations from the standard. It is part of the idea
to visualize problems.
Level schedules: Models on the assembly line are mixed in order to meet
customer demands and to avoid huge variation in the loading of the assembly
line. The work needs to be balanced or levelled, focussing on the processing of
smaller batches.
Assembly components: Parts or modules may be placed inside the car for an
easier access instead of placing the parts in shelves next to the assembly line.
Bigger modules are pre-assembled close to the main assembly line and are then
fed into the main assembly line (“ﬁshbone line feeding”).

286

Lean Supply Chain

9.5.3.1 Lean Thinking in the Supply Chain
Anker (2013) pointed out that a car can comprise 25,000 single parts and the related
material cost represents approximately 70% of the total production cost. In relation
to the price, the customer pays, the material cost accounts is in a range of 50%. The
level of supplies provided by external parties is at approximately 75%, that means
the in-house production roughly 25% (Anker 2013). In the case of the Smart
production facility in Hambach (France), the external contribution is close to 90%,
which shows that in that case the production depth is mainly with the suppliers and
the original equipment manufacturer (OEM) accounts for approximately 10%.
If we compare this with the examples given earlier, Ford initially strived for 100%
at the Rouge Complex, but reduced it back to 50% after World War II. For Taiichi
Ohno the question was how suppliers and producers could in the efﬁcient way work
together in order to jointly reduce cost and increase quality.
The principle process from design to production in Ford’s or GM’s approach was
that their own engineers designed the parts (previously purchased externally)
completely on their own. Then the blueprints were sent to potential part suppliers
who were supposed to submit their tenders. Following that, the supplier was selected
in principle on price, but also considering quality and delivery reliability—with the
side effect that suppliers were often switched, when others made better offers. Also
here one can see the change in mindset regarding the criteria to select suppliers.
Lean SCM recognizes that there was a lack of cooperation from suppliers and
their integration into the value chain. The potential of continuous improvement and
their contribution regarding best practices remained unutilized in the mass production approach. Also suppliers followed the principle of producing large batch sizes
that were shipped to the car producers. If a defect was discovered, many faulty parts
had already been installed in cars and at the same time a high number of defective
parts (inventory) were produced that required rework or scrapping.
Lean SCM identiﬁes the potential of the suppliers that was—comparable to the
knowledge capabilities of the shop ﬂoor workers—not utilized. Therefore lean SCM
encourages suppliers to contribute their own expertise, meaning that Toyota
speciﬁed the technical requirements that the part needed to fulﬁl, but the detailed
design was developed by the suppliers (who were able to optimize the components
they offered according to their own manufacturing).
Then, Ohno classiﬁed suppliers into multiple tiers. The tier 1 suppliers were the
ones who autonomously developed parts based on key requirements
(e.g. deceleration parameters, diameters and measures for brake systems. The
suppliers created prototypes that became the serial components when they successfully passed functionality tests. The tier 1 suppliers were in principle not in competition with each other, thus they openly shared their information at supplier level.
Taiichi Ohno also requested that the tier 1 suppliers should on their own establish a
second line of suppliers for themselves according to a similar principle. These
fabricating suppliers were in principle manufacturing specialists but not engineering
experts.

9.5 Lean Production Systems

287

These second tier suppliers were clustered and organized in non-competitor
supplier associations which also contributed to openly sharing information among
suppliers. As a side effect, “Toyota spun its in-house supply operations off into
quasi-independent ﬁrst-tier supplier companies in which Toyota retained a fraction
of the equity and developed similar relationships with other suppliers who had been
completely independent” (Womack et al. 2007, p. 60). Toyota also supported its
suppliers with ﬁnancial loans but also with workforce and encouraged the supplier
base to offer their products to other companies and industries.

9.5.3.2 Kanban
Presently, Lean thinking in the SC has been frequently considered in light of SC risk
management. It has been recognized that typical lean techniques such as single
sourcing or low inventory make the SC fragile in the case of disruptions at factories
and suppliers due to man-made and natural catastrophes (see Chap. 4, Ripple effect).
The next idea of the lean SCM is the simpliﬁcation of the logistical processes and
material call-offs. In principle, a connected chain as in a huge factory has to be
created, in which the previous production process feeds material in limited quantities
to the following process step after the material has been called off.
The idea was to employ circulating containers or boxes. Each container or box
was equipped with a card which signals the need for another container or material.
This card was called “kanban”. The containers and boxes were ﬁlled with parts and
then sent to the next production step and—when completely empty—returned to
their origin and thus acted as a call-off sign. The advantage was that inventory was
reduced throughout this SC. In an unfavorable situation in which one container
carried defective parts, the entire system would stop as soon as the defective part was
detected, since the circulation of the boxes would also be interrupted.
In essence, the following ﬁve elements are crucial for a lean SC.
• Perfect ﬁrst-time quality is achieved through the objective of creating zero
defects, revealing and solving problems at their ultimate source (e.g. the shop
ﬂoor), achieving higher quality and productivity simultaneously through teamwork or worker empowerment.
• Waste minimization is achieved by removing all non-value-added activities and
by making the most efﬁcient use of scarce resources (e.g. capital, people and
space) and by applying JIT deliveries as well as eliminating any safety buffers for
inventory reduction.
• Continuous improvement (reducing costs, improving quality and increasing productivity) is achieved through a dynamic process of change, simultaneous and
integrated product/process development, rapid takt time and time-to-market,
openness and information sharing.
• Flexibility is achieved through producing different mixes or greater diversity of
products quickly, without sacriﬁcing efﬁciency at lower volumes of production,
through rapid set-up and manufacturing in small lot sizes.

• Long-term relationships between suppliers and primary producers (assemblers,
system integrators) are established through collaborative risk sharing, costs
haring and information sharing arrangements.

Key Points and Discussion Questions

The decision on building a new or modifying an existing factory is of strategic
importance and needs to contribute to the generation of competitive advantage. The
role of factory planning is also to consider a successful partnership with the involved
parties in the SC and it is also aiming at the efﬁcient operations management. It is
recommended to consider the following questions in factory planning activities in
order to elaborate a successful approach to place a well operating facility with the
appropriate process ﬂow structures and capacity at the right location.
How to Plan a Factory in a Structured Way?
Factory planning is in general related to signiﬁcant investments. That is the reason
why the planning needs to take place in a structured and systematic way. A wrong
approach can result in an enormous loss of capital. Thus, a logical connection
between the initial planning phase of the facility, the realization of the new or
adjusted factory and the later operation (running the factory) needs to be established.
Between these different steps, careful milestone checks need to be made in order to
obtain the approval by the decision makers to move into the next phase.
Which Different Options Could Be Considered?
In factory planning it is not always necessary to create a completely new facility. It is
part of the general, regular tasks of the planners to re-design existing facilities in
order to ensure that new models can be produced at existing sites. Furthermore, the
existing plants can be expanded because of increasing demands. They can also be
reduced (or even closed) when the markets show decreasing demands. Another
option is the complete new creation of a factory on the “green ﬁeld” to be close to
the new market or local temporary production partnerships might also be an option
to meet possible local content requirements.
How to Support the Factory Capacity Planning Process?
In order to ensure the appropriate output of the facility, the demand needs to be
known or estimated in a substantiated way, so that the (design and effective) capacity
can be determined. Useful tools that help to identify the capacity aspects are for
example related to the application of Little’s Law, to run a bottleneck analysis
(theory of constraints) or to apply the principles of a systematic break-even-analysis,
decision trees, and waiting line theory.
What Are the Generic Process Flow Structures that Need to Be Considered?
When we talk about process ﬂow design, the immediate relation to the aspect of
volume of demand and the variety of the goods that will be produced needs to be

9.6 Key Points and Discussion Questions

289

made. When products with very low volume and a signiﬁcant variety have to be
produced, the principle of the “job shop” will be the right decision. If products need
to be produced in small lot sizes, for example 10 exactly same ﬁre trucks for the
regional ﬁre brigade, these 10 products will most probably be produced following
the “batch shop” approach, as these items are periodically produced in small batches
or lots. Assuming that for example 700 cars or 2000 microwave ovens will need to
be created per day, the “assembly line” is a suitable process ﬂow structure as it
allows mass production of standard goods following a regular pace while moving the
item from work station to work station. Finally for the production of very large
volumes of standard products such as medical pills, bottles of mineral water or sugar,
the production following the concept of a “continuous ﬂow” will be the ﬁtting
strategy.
How Do We Identify Non Value Adding Activities and What to Focus On?
One of the fundamental principles in running the operations is the application of the
“lean thinking”. According the idea of “lean”, a clear statement of what the customer
expects and what is considered as “value” is needed. Therefore, the value stream has
to be mapped and value adding respectively non-value adding processes has to be
analysed, so that unnecessary efforts or activities, such as waiting, over production,
defects etc. can be identiﬁed. This results in the identiﬁcation and elimination of the
so-called 7 + 1 wastes. Recently also wasted talent or knowledge has been added to
the 7 + x wastes. Another aspect of “lean” is the smooth ﬂow of the value adding
processes without obstacles or buffers according to the so-called “pull” principle.
Lean thinking also emphasizes to seek perfection by continuous improvement. A
fundamental lean consideration is the respect for people.
What Will Be Necessary for the Future?
Besides the focus on operational factors such as the design or the application of Lean
principles, also the rapid development of intelligence and internet technology
requires recognition. One modern trend is called Industry 4.0 which is related to
the fourth industrial revolution following ﬁrstly mechanization, secondly electriﬁcation and thirdly the use of information technology in the production domain. Using
the Internet of Things, machines and materials can exchange information in so-called
cyber-physical-systems. It is expected to gain additional efﬁciency potentials of
approximately 30% due to the intelligent combination of machines, materials and
the human being (Lemmer 2014).
Discussion Points
• Discuss in groups which external factors might inﬂuence companies to search for
new manufacturing or service sites
• Elaborate on the advantages and disadvantages but also which types of risks and
opportunities you can see when ﬁrms are regularly adjusting their industrial
footprint
• Analyse the impact of lean thinking on SC risk and vulnerability

• What are new requirements for the human being in the production environment
considering the development towards Industry 4.0?
• Will the new additive manufacturing technologies such as 3D printing in combination with new lightweight materials such as carbon composites impact the
process design and ﬂows structures in future?

Introductory Case-Study “OTLG Ludwigsfelde”

Volkswagen Original Teile Logistik GmbH & Co. KG (OTLG) is a service partner
for the spare parts of Volkswagen, Volkswagen Nutzfahrzeuge, Audi, Seat, and
Škoda. OTLG is part of the wholesale level of the SC and is responsible for sales and
marketing in Germany. At present, OTLG operates in seven distribution centers in
Germany. After locating a new distribution center, the layout planning has been done
as follows (Fig. 10.1).
The warehouse layout includes an incoming area for the receipt and inspection of
goods. If an order for the supplied item already exists, the item is moved via the
cross-docking area directly to the outbound area. Otherwise, the items are ﬁrst
stocked and then put away, and then picked up after an order is received. Such a
layout ensures the shortest transportation routes and the efﬁcient placement, put
away, and pick up of items with the help of sophisticated software and automated
material handling technologies.
On the basis of this case study, describe the basic processes and areas in
warehouse logistics layout.

Layout Planning in Manufacturing

In Chap. 9, the process ﬂow structures were presented, and it became evident that the
underlying parameters which determine which process ﬂow structures should be
used are volume and variety. The process ﬂow structures do not as such indicate
what type of manufacturing layout is best, but layout types are closely linked to the
processes applied to create a product.
A layout is the physical arrangement of objects in space. Fundamental objectives
related to this are as follows:
• to limit travel distances between machines or departments;
• to allocate departments or functional areas/main production areas in a reasonable
pattern;
• to avoid crossing ﬂows (material, transportation devices, human beings, etc.);
• to prepare for later adaptation or expansion.

10.2

Layout Planning in Manufacturing

295

In general, there are four basic types of layouts in manufacturing and these are:
•
•
•
•

ﬁxed position layout,
process ﬂow layout,
product ﬂow layout,
cell-based layout.

10.2.1 Fixed Position Layout
We start with the ﬁxed position layout. As the name indicates, in this type of layout
the product or object remains in a ﬁxed position while value is being added. Imagine
that there is construction work going on in a city: all workers, tools, machines, and
parts are brought and placed at the location where the work is performed. The same
is also valid for a movie set, where the technicians, actors, cameramen, directors, etc.
come to the location where the movie is shot.
Now that we have this understanding about the meaning of a ﬁxed position
layout, we discuss the manufacturing environment. A similar approach to the
movie example can also be applied in operations where the volume of goods
produced is rather low and where the product is extremely heavy or bulky, i.e.,
difﬁcult to move around. Examples are locomotives/trains, airplanes, or electrical
power windmills. In all of these cases, the product remains at the same location for a
very long period of time and the materials need to be brought close to the point of
value creation.
On the production ﬂoor, certain designated areas need to be deﬁned where the
parts or components will be placed by logistics/material movement staff. Footprints
(¼ marked areas on the factory ﬂoor) need to be deﬁned where the necessary
material will be buffered. The workers will need to walk back and forth from the
material buffer to the product to move material to the product. The same transportation effort also applies to tools, machines, or media (such as electricity, gas, or
water).
To give a practical example, imagine the assembly of a locomotive in a factory
facility. All necessary parts are buffered outside, so that the workers need to pick
them up and carry them inside the locomotive in order to conduct the ﬁnal assembly,
which is inside the locomotive. As this example implies, the ﬂexibility to e.g. change
the sequence of assembly work packages is quite high in a ﬁxed position layout
set-up.
In addition, the impact of defective tools or machines is not that intense, as the
layout provides an opportunity for replacing the machine and then continuing to
work. At the same time, aspects of motion and movement (walking, waiting,
searching), or the relatively high possible levels of buffered inventories are
disadvantages of this layout system. The symbolic illustration below shows the

Fig. 10.2).
"

Practical Insights In essence, for the production of a few heavy, bulky
products, the fixed position layout is a good choice, since it provides the
advantages of flexibility and adaptability. On the other hand the
disadvantages are the high amount of unnecessary motion and
movement.

10.2.2 Process Flow Layout
In the case of further processing of e.g. metal parts or metal products, the process
ﬂow layout is another basic type of layout. The key principle is that the operational
environment is split into specialized functional areas, for example, a department
where metal is cut, another department which is specialized in drilling, another one
specialized in milling, etc.
Such a layout of specialized functional areas in manufacturing is quite similar to
the layout of a hospital, where you have ﬁrst aid, the ophthalmologist, internist, or
the cardiologist ward.
In metal manufacturing, product 1 might ﬁrst require a drilling operation, then
some milling, and ﬁnally some welding. Product 2 might ﬁrst require bending, then
drilling, milling, and then welding. What becomes obvious is that the sequence of
processes that need to be performed determines the product ﬂow between

10.2

Layout Planning in Manufacturing

297

departments. This is also the reason why this layout type is called a “process ﬂow
layout.” The advantages are that the layout is quite ﬂexible, since it allows the
production of a very high number of very different products (of course they need to
be created under usage of similar production technologies and machines, as
explained above) in relatively high numbers.
The disadvantages are production in particular lot sizes, the high transportation
effort, and the danger of having quite a high number of crossing/contradicting
material ﬂows. As the departments are in principle specialized, multiple machines
are also likely to be available in e.g. the drilling department (see Fig. 10.3).
The process ﬂow layout is not very vulnerable to the breakdown of machines. If
drilling machine 4 breaks down, maybe the product can alternatively be produced
using drilling machine 5, for example, as Fig. 10.3 depicts. In order to understand
Fig. 10.3, the following short explanation regarding the hypothetical case above is
given. Product A is ﬁrst processed on drilling machine D2, then it is moved to
milling machine M4, and then it is welded on W2. After this, the product is painted
in paint shop P1. Finally, the packaging and shipping preparation take place. Next or
possible simultaneously, product B is moved through the facility, and processed on
machines B6, D1, M2, W1, and P2. As indicated above, products A and B ﬂow
through the manufacturing department according to the relevant process steps.
As illustrated in Fig. 10.3, the ﬂow might become almost chaotic. This is referred
to as a “spaghetti ﬂow illustrated as a spaghetti diagram” in lean thinking
terminology.

Layout Planning

Practical Insights In essence, for the production of hundreds or
thousands of similar (metal) parts, the process flow layout is a good
choice, since it provides the advantages of flexibility, general usability,
and has a relatively low level of vulnerability. The disadvantages are the
high amount of unnecessary motion and movement and crossing material flows.

Process-Flow Layout: A Practical View
Figure 10.4 shows the bay of the factory where machine-centers for the creation of
high-tech break disks are installed. The minimization of the transportation distances
between the machines was the fundamental principle of the layout planning. The
machine allocation ensures a ﬂow for the performance of a series of specialized
processes. In this speciﬁc case, the ﬂow is structured in the following way: turning—
milling—drilling. Non-destructive testing is also one of the processes that can be
performed along with the in-process removal of burrs or the balancing of the break
disks.
“High ﬂexibility” is key criterion to this layout design. The production processes
that are performed on multiple machines require the object be moved from one
machine-center to the other centers. This can be implemented in the layout developed. In principle, all the product ﬂows according to the production processes are
possible.

10.2

Figure 10.4 depicts the major lean principles. For example, visualization boards
showing material availability, Pareto charts on quality KPIs, check sheets or charts
showing adherence to production progress are placed on the shop ﬂoor. The objective is to obtain transparency regarding the planned and actual production progress,
to respect the 5S principles (sort, systemize, sweep, standardize, sustain—in Japanese seiri, seiton, seiso, seiketsu and shitsuke) and to secure TPM (Total Productive
Maintenance). Furthermore, the standardized color-coding clearly indicates the
footprints for raw-material and ﬁnished goods.
The break disks are produced in speciﬁed lot-sizes (batches) (see also Chap. 13)
and subject to the storage capacity of the shelves on the shop ﬂoor that deﬁne the
respective batch sizes. For example, if the storage capacity of a shelf equals 20 units,
a batch-size of 30 units would be impossible.
The setup of the manufacturing area in Fig. 10.4 is very ﬂexible. It makes it
possible to implement alternative ﬂow patterns according to the required processes
for the creation of the respective product. This is a very good example of a “processﬂow layout.”

10.2.3 Product Flow Layout
The key idea of this type of layout is that the product being created moves through a
series of specially designed and equipped workstations. It could be that the product
will be moved with a conveyor system (such as an assembly line for the production
of cars or household devices), but it could also be that the product is moved through
the deﬁned workstations manually (e. g. production of converter boxes for the
railway industry).
Usually, this type of layout is considered when a very high number of quite
similar products are produced, for example 1000 cars per day. It is important for a
properly working product ﬂow layout that the product moves through a facility with
the same speed (see Fig. 10.5).
For example, it might be that the product moves at a beat (or pace) of
e.g. 90 seconds from workstation to workstation. In principle, the different stations
are equipped with all necessary machinery and media, and the material required to be
installed into the product at that station is also buffered at the station. This means
each and every station is designed for a special purpose. If you think about car
assembly, you have an early station where the cable harnesses are placed into the car,
after which the carpets are installed, followed by the seats, and so on. The sequence
is important, but so is the duration of the work that needs to be performed, as well as
supporting technology and the necessary space for the material that is required at the
respective station. With respect to the logistics and the placement of materials, the
exact number of parts needs to be identiﬁed prior to planning the layout since they
must be buffered right next to the assembly station at the line, so that everything (the

300

product, the parts to be installed, the tools, and media) is within easy reach. These
parameters, parts, processes, tools, media, etc. have a signiﬁcant inﬂuence regarding
the dimensioning of the layout.
The product ﬂow layout can also be applied to the creation of household appliances
such as washing machines, refrigerators, or microwave ovens, or for sport shoes, etc.,
and the production volume needs to justify the special arrangements of the
workstations and the necessary tooling. The advantage is that the products can be
assembled in a very efﬁcient way: the product ﬂow is longitudinal and the timing is
very well balanced, according to the deﬁned pace (beat rate) of the product that moves
through the production facility in a one-piece single ﬂow mode. Besides these obvious
advantages, there are also disadvantages: if parts are missing or defective, or when a
machine or tool breaks down, the product ﬂow will be interrupted. While the layout
results in high efﬁciency, it is also highly vulnerable.
"

Practical Insights In essence, for the production of thousands of similar
products (such as cars or household appliances) per day, the product
flow layout might be a good choice, since it provides the advantages of
efficiency and smooth flow at a given pace along specially defined,
designed, and technically equipped workstations. The product flows
over these workstations at a constant cycle time. The disadvantage is
the high probability of interruptions or stoppages in the event of missing
parts or defective machines.

Product-Flow Layout: A Practical View
In the labor-intensive after sales and services business areas with their rather low
production volumes and high variety, the fundamental manufacturing layout with a

10.2

301

steady product-ﬂow layout combined with lean principles can also be implemented
(see Fig. 10.6).
In this speciﬁc case, the used break systems are refurbished in a special area of the
factory. Although there is no conveyor belt, the general assembly line principles (see
Chap. 9) were applied when the layout was designed. Figure 10.6 depicts the ﬁnal
assembly of the refurbished break systems as the product moves through a set of

Fig. 10.6 Product—ﬂow layout/assembly line for refurbishment processes [front view] (# KnorrBremse Berlin SfS GmbH)

302

Fig. 10.7 Product—ﬂow layout/assembly line for refurbishment processes [top view] (# KnorrBremse Berlin SfS GmbH)

especially designed workstations following a steady timing. This is also called takt
time (see also Chap. 9), which “is the rate (time per unit) at which the system must
produce a product to meet external customer demand” (Martin 2007).
Prior to the ﬁnal assembly, the used break systems received are checked in the
initial goods reception processes. Following this, the disassembly and cleaning of
the received systems take place (Fig. 10.7).
Pre-kitted sets of new replacement parts and other required assembly materials
are provided to the assembly line along with the cleaned and disassembled
components on trolleys. Visual media and footprints on the ﬂoor mark the individual
positions for the trolleys, as shown in Fig. 10.7. Furthermore, tools and jigs are
placed within easy reach respecting the best point philosophy for an ergonomic
workplace. Figure 10.7 clearly shows that for smaller series with high manual
efforts, the fundamental principles of the “product-ﬂow layout” can be effectively
applied.

10.2.4 Cell-Based Layout
In the case of the cell-based layout, the advantages of the product ﬂow layout
(smooth ﬂow) and process ﬂow layout (ﬂexibility) are combined. This type of layout
is also called a hybrid layout or is referred to as the grouping of technology. The
main idea is to group the machines, tools, and equipment required in the exact

sequence of the production steps so that there will be no crossing of the materials and
transportation distances are minimized.
In such a case the product is created by moving through the cell. Most likely, the
pallets with the in-production products (semi-ﬁnished goods) are moved from one
machine to another manually, i.e. in most cases there will be batches of products
produced per machine, and when they are ﬁnished on that particular machine, the lot
is moved to the next machine or station (see Fig. 10.8).
In most cases this is not a single piece ﬂow, but most often a ﬂow of batches.
Despite this inefﬁciency, there will still be a kind of smooth ﬂow. In contrast to a real
assembly line, the alignment of the machines in the cell is cheaper, and with
reasonable effort the cells can be rearranged to make other products.
Figure 10.8 shows products A and B and their production sequence as it was
introduced for the process ﬂow layout. The following illustration considers the
generation of two cells. One for the creation of product A and the second for product
B. As one can see, the ﬂow of products becomes almost one directional and the
crossing of the material ﬂows is signiﬁcantly reduced because of the rearrangement
of the required machines.

Practical Insights Please note that for some machining, such as welding,
an exhaust evacuation system might be required. Space constraints or
certain media connections will need to be assessed in this regard.

Layout Planning

In essence, for the production of similar products (such as computer
chips, sub-assemblies, lamps, etc.), the cell-based layout is a good choice,
since it provides the advantages of a smooth product flow layout and the
flexibility of a process flow layout.

Cell-Based Layout: A Practical View
In Fig. 10.9, the assembly of valves in a cell-based layout is depicted. The developed
layout considers a balanced one-piece-single-ﬂow that runs in a counter-clock-wise
manner. The operational processes start on the upper left-hand side. It can be
observed that the cell has a typical “U-shape.” After the product has moved through
the cell and reached the upper right-hand point, all necessary production steps are
ﬁnalized and the handover to the inspection department takes place.
The applied layout design strictly separates the operators and their value-adding
working environment inside the very well illuminated U-shape from the material
replenishment processes which take place outside the cell. The workers continue
their work in the center of the cell while new material is fed into the cell and empty

bins are collected from the outside. This ensures disturbance-free operation on the
process side and the availability of secured material.
All tools, machinery, and material can be easily reached. Lean ergonomics
criteria, adjustable best point locations and positions, as well as the 5S principles,
have also been considered in the creation of the cell-based layout. Furthermore, the
screens show the standard operating instructions. The torques of the machines and
the usage of lubricants are automatically supervised in order to secure zero defects
throughout all the production steps.
Such a concept eliminates non-value adding times, securing the highest quality
outputs while the operating processes are balanced and conducted in the most
ergonomic way all at the same time. The manufacturing area shown in Fig. 10.9 is
a very good example of a “cell-based layout.”

10.3

Layout Planning in Warehouses

The processes in warehouses can be done manually or be automated. Automation is
not always the best option. Automation requires investments in software. Manual
process organization can be the more ﬂexible option. However, automation can help
in increasing efﬁciency and reducing lead time.
The basic warehouse processes are represented in Fig. 10.10. Consider these
processes in detail.

10.3.1 Incoming Area
After the receipt and control of goods in the incoming area, items can be either
moved to storage or directly to the outbound area if, e.g., customer orders already
exist, or because of a cross-docking principle which means the in-transit merging of
different incoming bins to some outgoing bins without intermediate storage.

In many cases, returns are also processed in the incoming area. For example, in
the warehouses of E-Commerce retailers, the return rate can be up to 70% of sales.

10.3.2 Storage Area
Next, in the storage area, several storage strategies can be applied:
• dedicated storage
• cluster storage and class-based storage
• random storage.
In dedicated storage, each item is assigned exactly to a predetermined storage
place. Cluster storage presumes building some zones for items with common
features, e.g., items which are frequently ordered together; or items from the same
supplier. Class-based storage means that items are stored on the basis of ABC
classiﬁcation (see Chap. 13). In random storage, a chaotic warehouse policy is
applied.
The advantages and shortcomings of each strategy are summarized in Table 10.1.

10.3.3 Put-Away and Order Pick-Up
FIFO (ﬁrst-in-ﬁrst-out) and LIFO (last-in-ﬁrst-out) are two basic strategies for
put-away organization. Two order picking strategies are “man-to-goods” and
“goods-to-man.” In the “man-to-goods” strategy, there are several options for
picking: Printed pick-up list, Electronic messaging, Pick by Light, Pick by Voice.
It should be noted that even if new technologies like pick by voice present
advantages, many logistics managers consider them to have shortcomings from an
ergonomic point of view.

10.3.4 Layout Concepts
Two layout concepts, straightforward and L-shaped, can be distinguished from one
another. In the introductory case study, we considered OTLG distribution center.
This company applied the L-shaped layout. In Fig. 10.11, the L-shaped layout of the
OTLG warehouse is presented.
Consider another example, the company REWE, which is active in the food
retailing industry. Speciﬁc for the food retailing industry are the fast processing
times for fresh goods. This is why a straightforward layout was selected (Fig. 10.12).
According to this layout, the warehouse is divided into four temperature zones:
dry assortment, fruits and vegetables area, fresh meat area (0  C), and a deep-freeze
area (24  C). The work in the deep-freeze area is very hard since in the summer the
difference between the outside and inside temperatures can be more than 60  C. The
trucks from the suppliers arrive at the gates and are unloaded. The pallets (mostly
plastic pallets for hygiene and weight reasons) are moved to the storage area. The
random storage principle is applied to the placement of pallets on the shelves. With
the help of lift trucks, the pallets are picked up and delivered to the outbound area.
The plastic pallets are used to simplify handling at the stores since they only weigh
6 kg. In addition, heavier items are typically located on the bottom of the pallet while
lighter items come on the top. The warehouse operates from Sunday 4:00 am to
Saturday 6:00 pm. Since demand constantly increases, automation can reduce the
lead time and adjust process capacity.

Fig. 10.12 Straightforward layout form of a warehouse

About 380 employees in Oranienburg (Germany) ensure the replenishment of
REWE supermarkets with about 11,000 SKU (Stock Keeping Units). One hundred
trucks deliver products to 330 supermarkets from Sassnitz to Jüterbog daily. This
means the optimization of 240 routes daily. With the help of modern software using
a scientiﬁc methodology for vehicle routing and advanced navigation information
technology, 95% capacity utilization for trucks is achieved. In the ﬁrst half of 2012,
35 million incoming items of freight, which arrived on 958,398 euro-pallets, were
processed in the incoming area. Thirty-six million items of freight were delivered to
markets. The average inventory in the warehouse is valued at about 30.6 million
euros. The inventory turnover for dry assortment is about 12; for fresh meat—2100
(on average, a package of fresh meat is processed at the warehouse within 4 h).

Methods of Layout Planning

Methods of layout planning can be divided into qualitative and quantitative. In this
chapter, we consider the qualitative method “REL-charts” and a quantitative method
“quadratic assignment problem.”

10.4.1 REL-Charts
10.4.1.1 Problem Statement
REL stands for relationship. With the help of this chart, the activities are illustrated
according to their relationship (activity relationship charts, ARC). Now let us
consider a speciﬁc problem. A layout for a retail warehouse has to be developed
with consideration of desirable/undesirable proximity of some areas. The process is
presented in Fig. 10.13.

10.4

The following notations are used:
•
•

•
•

WE—incoming and inspection area
LA, LB, LC—storage areas for А-items, В-items, and С-items respectively
WА—shipment area
КО—pick-up area
RE—receiving area for returns
RS—storage area for returns
RА—shipment area for returns

10.4.1.2 Solution Method
The REL-chart method is based on the identiﬁcation of desirable/undesirable proximity relations for each pair of warehouse areas. This identiﬁcation is subjective and
based on expert estimations. In our case, the following REL-chart can be developed
(Fig. 10.14).
The following notations are used:
•
•
•
•
•

А—proximity is absolutely mandatory
E—proximity is very desirable
I—proximity is important
O—proximity is possible
U—proximity is undesirable

For example, the relation between the pick-up area and the shipment area is set up
as “A” since these areas are to be located close to each other according to the process
ﬂow in Fig. 10.10.
Taking into account the process ﬂow from the problem statement and the
developed REL-matrix, the following layout can be suggested (Fig. 10.15).
Note that since REL-chart is a qualitative method based expert estimations, the
suggested solution is only one possible option.

10.4.2 Quadratic Assignment Problem
10.4.2.1 Problem Statement
Some machines have to be assigned to some available locations. For each pair of
locations, a distance is known. Similarly, for each pair of facilities a material ﬂow is
speciﬁed (Fig. 10.16).
Assign machines to locations so that total transportation cost is minimized.

10.4.2.2 Model
Consider the following notations according to Fig. 10.16.
M ¼ {Mj, j, k ∈ M, j, k ¼ (1, . . .M)} is a set of locations.
N ¼ {Nh, h, i ∈ N, h, i ¼ (1, . . .N )} is a set of machines.
dj,k is a distance between two locations.
th,i is material ﬂow intensity between two machines.
Assume that transportation costs are linear and therefore proportional to dj,k  th,i
for the assignment h ! j and i ! k.
We introduce an auxiliary variable xhj which is equal to 1 if the h-machine is
assigned to the j-location and xhj ¼ 0 otherwise. Then the model can be deﬁned in the
following way:
Objective function

Constraints (10.2) dictate that each machine should be assigned to only one
location. Constraint (10.3) dictates that auxiliary variable xhj is a Boolean variable.
In reality, additional constraints of a technological and technical nature may exist
which are difﬁcult to formalize.

10.4.2.3 Model Analysis and Solution Methods
The model (10.1, 10.2 and 10.3) is a linear integer programming model. Such a class
of model is NP-hard. This means the optimal solution for reasonable problem size

312

and in reasonable time is difﬁcult to obtain with the help of classical methods for
solving such problems (e.g., branch & bound). This is why different heuristics are
used in practice for such solutions.

10.4.3 Simulation: Modeling Operations at Pharmaceutical
Distribution Warehouses with AnyLogic
Problem Description
Cardinal Health, a billion dollar pharmaceutical distribution and logistics ﬁrm,
manages multiple products, from brand name pharmaceuticals and generic drugs
to over the counter drugs, health and beauty items, as well as their own private label.
They face a multitude of typical distribution warehouse challenges that are further
complicated by the nature of pharmaceutical products, which are smaller in size,
consumable, expensive, and possibly life critical. Cardinal Health is an essential link
in the healthcare SC, offering next day delivery to over 30,000 locations including
hospitals, retail pharmacies, physicians’ ofﬁces, and direct to consumer.
Other value added services include efﬁciency and demand management, working
capital management and contract credit management. These services along with poor
manufacturing reliability and supply disruptions in the market due to Food and Drug
Administration (FDA) and Disability Discrimination Act (DDA) regulations add
complexity to decision making. Cardinal Health must keep up with the variability in
pharmaceutical distribution management. Cardinal Health must consider facility
layout, ﬂow of product, order picking, labor planning and scheduling, customer
order requirements, and day-to-day operations management.
Model Development
Traditional analysis tools, such as empirical trial and error, are risky, expensive and
difﬁcult to use for making changes. Industrial engineering and operations
researchers suggested mathematical models which were inexpensive, but did not
capture unexpected dynamics. If anything is open or has emergent behaviors, such as
congestion, a standard mathematical model is unable to solve the problem. Process
driven or discrete event modeling was not advantageous because of its inability to
represent a facility naturally. This led Brian Heath (Director of Advanced Analytics
at Cardinal Health) and Cardinal Health to explore alternative analysis options.
Agent Based Modeling (ABM) with AnyLogic Simulation and Modeling software
gave Cardinal Health the tools required to tackle many distribution warehouse issues
without the restrictions of traditional tools.
Solution Development
ABM represents the abstraction of distributed autonomous entities that can interact
with each other and their environment through space and time, allowing Cardinal
Health to capture work time allocation, congestion waiting time, cycle times,
distance traveled, worker variability and other important metrics.

10.5

Key Points

313

Testing the Solution
The model built was ultimately concerned with the activities of employees and their
interaction with each other during the day, making it necessary to import data such as
picking time and performance standards into the model.
Analyzing the Results
Cardinal Health could gather congestion waiting time data and see how much of a
problem it was causing in the warehouse since “agents” were modelled as
individuals with special relationships to each other. Additional parameters included
in the model were several worker speeds, worker behavior, learning curves, cycle
times, product turn-around, and distance covered walking or driving. The ability to
import Excel ﬁles was also imperative as Cardinal Health has numerous warehouses,
and it is mandatory to test multiple layouts. Using AnyLogic, a change is as simple
as updating the Excel ﬁle, importing it into the model and running the model again.
Implementation
The ABM built with AnyLogic software allowed Cardinal Health to compare
layouts, picking technology, and product slotting strategies. In addition, they could
evaluate different methods of picking to update stafﬁng models and for on-the-ﬂoor
support if a workload changed, as orders vary on a day-to-day basis. Statistics were
also gathered, such as takt time, how many batches are completed in an hour, truck
unloading time, and sequencing of events. Despite the clarity provided by the above
metrics, the model revealed a problem because of the random distribution of work.
Employees’ workloads were uneven, with one being faster and one slower. By
balancing the workload, employees began working at a similar pace and congestion
decreased dramatically. By minimizing congestion using AnyLogic software, Cardinal Health was able to decrease the average shift length from 10.5 to 7.25 h and
increased employee capacity. Cardinal Health saves over $3 million annually using
ABM with AnyLogic Simulation technology. “AnyLogic’s agent libraries, ﬂexible
architecture, and integrated animation enables the continuing success of this project,” declared Brian Heath, Director of Advanced Analytics at Cardinal Health. You
can view his presentation and learn more about using ABM in real world application.

Key Points

A layout is the physical arrangement of objects in a space. Fundamental objectives of
layout planning are cost minimization for internal transportation, lead time reduction, or reasonable arrangement of departments in facilities. In addition, layout
planning can be used to reduce the risk of good damages because of accidents in
the warehouse, e.g., a ﬁre.
In general, there are four basic types of layouts in manufacturing:
• ﬁxed position layout
• process ﬂow layout

314

10

Layout Planning

• product ﬂow layout
• cell-based layout.
These forms of layouts depend on the process ﬂow design. In warehouses the
layout is determined by the process ﬂow, which includes the following stages:
•
•
•
•
•
•

incoming and inspection area
storage area
put-away area
pick-up area
packing area
shipment area.

Methods of layout planning can be divided into qualitative and quantitative. We
considered a qualitative method “REL-charts” and a quantitative method “quadratic
assignment problem.” REL-charts can be applied to cases where considerations of
desirable/undesirable proximity of some areas are important. The quadratic assignment problem is an optimization method for optimal layout planning with the
objective of minimizing total transportation costs.

10.6

Discussion

In our examples, production facilities were described (e.g., the creation of brake
systems) or the layout of retail warehouses for distribution centers for spare parts and
food retailing. Please discuss how the layout planning consideration might be
transferred to layout problems in the following cases:
•
•
•
•

ofﬁces in an insurance company
departments at your local authorities
structure of supermarkets or shopping malls
organisation of functional areas at hospitals or clinics.

What do you think are the relevant criteria which inﬂuence decisions on these
layouts?

11.1

Introductory Case Study

Good forecasting is vital for all business planning. If estimates are too high, a
company overproduces goods that cannot be sold. On the one hand, this is unnecessary production and increases costs for resources such as raw materials, workforce,
or storage space. On the other hand, underproduction can result in shortages and lost
business opportunities and a potential loss of customers who cannot be served.
Good forecasting can be a competitive advantage. For example, Walt Disney
Entertainment Parks put extremely high emphasis on predicting the next hours’,
days’ and weeks’ demand. Since they have been managing to almost always
accurately predict future demand, revenue has been increasing immensely. Moreover, forecasting can be useful for analyzing areas for improvement.
Predictions about demand need to be made. However, forecasts are almost always
wrong, as operations to calculate them are rather complex. Demand sometimes
changes without prior warning and usually the effects set in later, making it difﬁcult
for operations managers to react.

Demand Forecasting

However, some demand swings can be taken into consideration with relative
reliability, such as seasonal changes. These include weather or particular holidays.
For example, a city hotel, a supermarket, a metal producer, and a knitwear shop are
all differently dependent on these external factors. A city hotel has the most
customers during the holiday season, whereas a knitwear shop sells primarily in
autumn and winter. The supermarket may face peak times, for example during lunch
and after work hours. The factory producing metals is the most likely to be
independent of seasonal swings and to have a steady demand throughout the year.
However, many businesses have realized the correlation between weather and sales,
which is why demand for meteorological forecasting services has increased rapidly.
Forecasts are generally expressed in terms that are also useful for capacity
management, production, and SC planning. The aim is not only to be as accurate
as possible, but also to know the difference between the plan and actual data. This
range can help to improve forecasts in the future and to estimate which forecasting
techniques perform better. Moreover, forecasts are made for the close and long-term
future. Generally, short-term forecasts tend to be more accurate.
There are various tools to generate a demand forecast:
• expert estimates,
• time series analysis,
• regression analysis.
An expert estimate is a qualitative analysis tool that is drawn from historic
demand and expert opinions on future development. In one case, Sport Obermeyer,
a sports clothing retailer, applied this method. Initially, the whole team was involved
in a decision about the next forecast. However, management noticed that some
people would always dominate the decision process, so they decided that decisions
would be made independently and the results would be compared and clustered. If
most team members had forecast a similar result the product was categorized as easy
to forecast. Otherwise, it was labeled “hard to forecast.” For these “hard to forecast”
products, the sports retailer delayed forecasting in order to reduce errors. In the case
of Sport Obermeyer, using expert opinions worked extremely well with the new
method.
Time series analysis, for instance exponential smoothing, takes sales data from
the past to estimate new demand in the future. The restaurant chain “Red Lobster”
uses this analysis tool with demand forecasting software. Each evening the software
creates a new forecast for the next day listing exactly which meals need to be
prepared. Managers then adjust these forecasts based solely on local specialties.
Regression analysis can be applied to estimate the dependence between two
factors. For example, in a telecommunication company, monthly repair efforts can
be analyzed to estimate the numbers of service employees needed. There are various
other options for predicting future demand. These include simple probability, neutral
networks, and fuzzy logic, to name a few.
Demand forecasting in medical care has an extraordinary role. Unlike for production companies, an insufﬁcient supply of resources does not mean an unhappy
customer, but affects the condition of a patient’s health. Even though hospitals serve
the public, they also need to make a proﬁt. Hence, the sector faces the same dilemma

11.2

Forecasting Process and Methods

321

in forecasting demand to match supply and resources: lost sales opportunities equal
lost treatment opportunities. On the other hand, the aim is to minimize excess
capacities and to minimize costs.
Forecasts in hospitals can be useful when applied to human resources such as
nurses and doctors, customers (patients needing treatment), and operational goods
such as beds and medicines. For stafﬁng beds, queuing models can be applied. These
methods help to analyze the capacity utilization of beds. This can be relevant for long
term planning to determine how many rooms and beds are needed. These are then
ﬁxed costs, which are difﬁcult to reduce in the future. Average methods are not an
appropriate measurement here. If the mean of all ﬂu patients is taken over the year,
there would be empty beds in summer and not nearly enough beds in winter.
In medical care, emergency departments face the most extreme situation. Patients
arrive randomly at any time of the day. This means the workload is highly variable.
The severity of sicknesses also varies. To manage patient arrivals, hospitals apply
systems which categorize patients as seriously ill, non-urgent, and routine. The latter
are likely to be turned away from the emergency department and asked to arrange a
doctor’s appointment. For the ﬁrst two categories a schedule is developed. Crowding
in emergency departments endangers healthcare provision. Hence, forecasting plays
an important role, and analytical models are used to ensure patients’ needs are met
more efﬁciently. Researchers have spent much effort in ﬁnding the best forecasting
methods for this ﬁeld.
In a sample emergency department, researchers came to the conclusion that time
series analysis can provide a good method for indicating future needs. Daily patient
attendances can be computed. For estimates, the autoregressive integrated moving
average (ARIMA) method can be used, including such variables as holidays, air
pollution, temperature, and humidity. The variables are then correlated to arrivals in
the emergency department. The application of the ARIMA method can improve
resource availability, especially staff planning.
Questions
In which ﬁelds is (demand) forecasting used?
Why is demand forecasting in medical care particularly challenging?
Why are means or averages not sensible measures for planning bed capacities?
Which analysis methods can be used to evaluate crowding problems in emergency departments?

11.2

Forecasting Process and Methods

Forecasting future demand is one of the major decisions in SCOM. Forecast sales
data represent the input for further production, transportation, sourcing, and inventory planning. Moreover, many strategic decisions, such as facility location
planning, revenue management, and process design, interact with demand forecasts
(see Fig. 11.1).

322

11

Demand Forecasting

Fig. 11.1 Role of demand
forecasting in SCOM

Forecasts can be made for operative or strategic issues. Similarly, different
methods can be applied to forecast demand. In this section, we consider the process
of forecasting, different time horizons, and basic forecasting methods.

11.2.1 The Forecasting Process and Time Horizons
The forecasting process begins with the deﬁnition of the objective. The second step
is to determine the time horizon over which the forecasts should be performed. For
example, for an airline, the objective might be to deﬁne how many airplanes should
be purchased over the next 10 years. The next step is to select the method of
forecasting. This depends on both the deﬁned horizon and the available data. After
data acquisition, forecasting is performed, typically using software.
The results should be controlled continuously since any SCOM system and its
environment is highly dynamic and subject to many external and internal changes.
The forecasting process is presented in Fig. 11.2 using an example for forecasting
the number of printed materials for a university lecture based on the prediction of
student attendance.
A professor must deﬁne every week how many handouts should be printed for the
next lecture. In this case, the time horizon is a week. For such short term issues, time
series analysis is the preferred method. Based on the attendance list from the last
lectures, exponential smoothing can be performed to predict demand.
Other time horizons may include anything from 3 months to 3 years. Examples of
decisions for this medium-range horizon are sales and operations planning or
budgeting. Long term forecasting typically refers to a period of over 3 years, e.g.,
new product planning, facility location planning, and research and development
(R&D). Medium-range forecasts are used to deal with more comprehensive issues
and support management decisions regarding planning and products, plants, and
processes. Short term forecasts tend to be more accurate than longer term forecasts.

11.2

Forecasting Process and Methods

323

Fig. 11.2 Forecasting process

11.2.2 Forecasting Methods
Forecasting methods can be divided into qualitative and quantitative methods (see
Fig. 11.3).
Qualitative methods are used when the situation is vague and little data exists.
Typically, such situations have a long term nature or include decisions are to be
taken about new technology or product. Forecasting for such cases involves intuition
and experience. In many cases, the forecasting process relies on historical data such
as demand numbers or turnovers. This works well as long as a company has reliable
data which is available for the required forecasting. But how does this work if a
company wants to launch a new technology? In this case, they must rely on expert
views and customers’ opinions.
This expert type of forecasting is normally based on professional knowledge and
experience. A company uses input from different experts to develop forecasting for
the next period. The problem with the expert methods is that they are based on
opinions, experiences, and knowledge of human beings, and are therefore subjective.
There are different methods for qualitative forecasting. One of the methods is
sales estimation. For this method, a company asks their sales expert about the latest
turnover ﬁgures and aggregates the data for overall turnover, using the data to
develop a forecast. The next qualitative method is the customer survey. This is a
good tool to use when a company launches a new product and there is no historical
data or expert experiences. A company can ask their customers directly what they
think of the new product and try to develop forecasting for the product launch.
The third method is the basic idea of qualitative forecasting—the expert view. A
company asks proven experts about new technologies or their experiences with
similar products in the past. These experts normally work in different departments
of the same company.

methods

The best known qualitative forecasting method is the Delphi Method. It is an
extension of the expert view and the feature is a structured multiple expert survey
using specialists from different companies and institutions. The Delphi Method runs
in two or more rounds. A moderator develops a questionnaire and all the experts
reply anonymously. After the ﬁrst round the moderator creates a new questionnaire
based on the information he got. Answers to the ﬁrst round are published to all other
experts so everybody can rethink their view. Next, they ﬁll out the new questionnaire
and so on until it leads to a consensus.
Quantitative methods are used when historical data exists, e.g., existing products,
existing technology or existing markets. These methods are based on statistics.
Statistical methods can be classiﬁed in two different forecasting methods:
• causal forecast
• time series analysis.
In causal forecasting, the demand (y) for a product depends on a known factor
(x) and because of this it can be forecast (see Fig. 11.4). For example: Demand for
axis (y) depends on the number of citizens in a district (x). Linear trends can be found
using the least squares technique that results in Eq. (11.1):
b
y ¼ a þ bx

ð11:1Þ

where ŷ is the computed value of the variable to be predicted (dependent variable);
a is y-axis intercept; b is the slope of the regression line; and x is the independent
variable.
Non-linear regression is more complicated, but also more realistic. For a causal
forecasting method, it is important to have reliable historical data for the known
factor (the independent variable).
On the other hand, there is time series analysis. It is based on historical sales data.
Sets of evenly spaced numerical data can be obtained by observing response
variables at regular time periods. This method actually forecasts on the basis of the
past values and assumes that factors inﬂuencing past and present will continue to
inﬂuence in future.
There are different methods to forecast demand depending on the temporal
progress of demand (see Fig. 11.5):
If there is a constant demand for a product we can use the Moving Average or the
Simple Exponential Smoothing. For products with a demand which is based on
trends, we can use Regression Analysis or Double Exponential Smoothing. Products
with seasonal demand can be forecast using Triple Exponential Smoothing.

11.2.3 Forecasting Quality
Different forecasting methods can provide a different forecast quality. In order to
estimate the quality of a forecast, some measures are used in practice, including
• mean absolute deviation (MAD),
• mean squared error (MSE),
• mean absolute percentage error (MAPE).
MAD measures the absolute deviation (ε) of forecast and actual data over
T-periods according to formula (11.2):
MAD ¼

T t¼1

MSE measures the quadratic deviation of forecast and actual data according to
formula (11.3):
MSE ¼

MAPE measures the percentile deviation of forecast and actual data according to
formula (11.4):
T  
1X
 εt 
MAPE ¼
T t¼1 yt 

ð11:4Þ

The practical problem with the MAD measure is that it expresses the absolute
values and is therefore quantity-dependent. This makes it difﬁcult to apply MAD for
comparison of forecasts for different products. MSE is frequently used because of its
good theoretical properties, but may be negatively affected by so-called outliers or
freak values. MAPE is intuitively good and understandable and can be used for
comparison of different forecasts where MAD/MSE values differ.
"

11.3

Practical Insight In practice, statistically computed measures for forecast
quality analysis need to be checked carefully. For example, consider
actual sales data for five periods: 10–10–11–10–11 and two forecasts:
(a) 8–8–9–8–9 and (b) 8–12–9–12–9. From a statistical point of view, both
forecasts have the same MAD ¼ 2. But from management point of view
the first forecast (a) has a bias since we always produce less than
demand. For managers it is more important to identify bias rather than
strive for minimal forecast error.

Statistical Methods

In this section, we learn in more detail how to compute demand forecasts with the
help of different statistical methods.

11.3.1 Linear Regression
Linear regression is normally used as a causal forecasting method. The procedure
will be explained by taking sales in a newly established, small tea shop that depends
on the number of customers as an example, as shown in Table 11.1.
The ﬁrst step is to calculate the regression function b
y ð xÞ ¼ b
aþb
bx with the
parameter â and b
b. It is important to ﬁnd the â and b
b where the MSE has its
minimum. To ﬁnd the parameters we need to ﬁll out the following Table 11.2.
In order to calculate the coefﬁcient b
b, formula (11.5) can be used:

The computed value 7.263 means that when there is one more customer per week,
sales income rises by approximately 7.26 €.
There are two options to calculate â. The ﬁrst option is the usage of Eq. (11.6):

11.3.2 Moving Average
The method of moving average is based on computing the average demand from the
previous periods and using these values for forecasting. It is called “moving”
because with every period the average value changes or moves onward.
Consider the following example and function to understand forecasting with the
help of the moving average. Here, too, it is important to ﬁnd the result with the
lowest MSE. The demand for each subsequent period is computed subject to formula
(11.9):
b
y tþ1 ¼

1
T

t
X

yt

ð11:9Þ

τ¼tTþ1

where b
y tþ1 is the forecast for the next period, yτ is the demand in period t, and T is the
number of periods. It is important to choose a T that is not too large and not too
small. Normally you calculate with different T-values to ﬁnd the one with the
lowest MSE.
Consider this example. Lebon Ltd. wants to ﬁnd its weekly average demand for
Cupcakes. Table 11.4 illustrates the last weeks’ demand.
Three different numbers of periods to be averaged are given:
T1 ¼ 2; T2 ¼ 3; and T3 ¼ 4. The calculation results are presented in Table 11.5.
For example, to compute the forecast for week #3: 31 ¼ (26 + 35)/2 ! we add
demand from the previous two periods and divide it using T1.
To check which T is the one with the smallest MSE we have to calculate the
forecast error. It is important to start with a period where for all T-values the sales
have been forecast in order to make the MSE values comparable. In this case it is
week #5 (see Table 11.6).

As we can see, the smallest T is the best one because there the MSE is at its
minimum. For this reason the recommendation for forecasting the next periods will
be using T ¼ 2.
In some cases, a weighted moving average can be used. In this case, older data
usually becomes less important and the weights are assigned to different periods
based on experience and intuition.

11.3.3 Simple Exponential Smoothing
This method is close to that of the weighted moving average. The weightings decline
exponentially and the most recent data are weighted higher. For sales forecasts,

330

11

Demand Forecasting

average demand/sales values of previous periods are exponentially weighted to
forecast the next periods. The simple exponential average means working with a
smoothing parameter α. The idea is to weight current demand higher and to assign
lower weights to the previous demand.
In this method we use formula (11.10) to forecast the demand for the following
periods:
b
y t, tþ1 ¼ α  yt þ ð1  αÞ  b
y t1, t

ð11:10Þ

where b
y t, tþ1 is the forecast that we are making in the current period for the following
y t1, t is the forecast we made in the last period
period, yt is the current demand, and b
for the current period.
Consider the following example as an aid to understanding simple exponential
smoothing. Demand for a product during the last six periods is provided
(Table 11.7).
The smoothing parameters are α1 ¼ 0.3 and α2 ¼ 0.5. The idea is to choose the
smoothing parameter which leads to a smaller MSE (see Table 11.8).
For example to compute the forecast sales for period #3: 54.5 ¼ 0.344 +
(1–0.3)  59 ! we multiply the demand in week #2 by α and the forecast
demand for week #2 by (1  α) to get the forecast for week #3. In this case,
MSE ðα1 Þ ¼ 338:75
 56:46.
6
Consider the calculations for Table 11.9:
MSE(α2) ¼ 385.46/6  64.24. As we can see, the second smoothing parameter
leads to a higher MSE. For this reason it is advisable in this case to forecast demand
for the following periods with the smoothing parameter of 0.3 instead of 0.5.
This method helps to forecast the call for products with a steady demand. But to
forecast the sales for products which have a trend-shaped or seasonal demand we
need other methods.

11.3.4 Double Exponential Smoothing
Double exponential smoothing is used for situations where a trend already exists.
This method works with two smoothing factors, α and β. The basic idea is that
demand is normally overrated when a trend is positive and underrated when the trend
is negative. Consider the formula (11.11):
b
y t, tþτ ¼ at þ bt  τ

ð11:11Þ

Where b
y t, tþτ is the forecast for the following period performed in the current
period, at is the smoothed forecast, bt is the smoothed trend parameter (slope), and τ
is the parameter which describes the number of periods for which we are making the
forecast. We calculate at and bt as follows from Eqs. (11.12–11.13):
at ¼ α  yt þ ð1  αÞc  ðat1 þ bt1 Þ

ð11:12Þ

bt ¼ β  ðat  at1 Þ þ ð1  βÞ  bt1

ð11:13Þ

Assume that we have the demand data of gluten-free bread in a small grocery
shop for the last seven periods (Table 11.10).
To forecast the demand for 7 months in the following year we use the following
parameters: α ¼ 0.2; β ¼ 0.35; τ ¼ 1; b1 ¼ 4. The computational results are
presented in Table 11.11:
By changing the smoothing factors we can obtain a more reliable forecast for the
next periods where a trend exists.
To handle forecasts for seasonal products we can use triple exponential smoothing. In this case, the third parameter, for seasonal ﬂuctuations, is added to double
exponential smoothing.

Key Points and Outlook

In this chapter, we learned methods and practical tools for demand forecasting. Let
us summarize the key points of this chapter as follows. For SCOM, it is important to
understand the role, process, and methods of demand forecasting, since forecasts are
used for both tactical and strategic decisions. Production planning, inventory management, facility location, and capacity planning rely on decisions that depend on
demand forecasting.
The forecasting process consists of six steps: (1) deﬁne the objective; (2) determine the time horizon;(3) select the method of forecasting; (4) gather data; (5) perform the forecasting; (6) validate and control the results. Forecasting methods can be
divided into qualitative and quantitative methods. Qualitative methods are used
either for new product and technology or for long term decisions where data from
the past cannot be considered a reliable source. Qualitative methods use expert
knowledge and experience and include such techniques as sales estimation, customer surveys, expert estimation, and the Delphi Method.
We also learned several quantitative methods which are used when historical data
exists and statistical tools can be applied. Regression analysis and time series
analysis, including the moving average and exponential smoothing (simple, double,
triple), belong to quantitative methods. We learned how to apply statistical methods
for forecasting and to calculate the forecasts based on statistical methods.
For quantitative methods, it is important to understand the measures for forecasts’
quality assessment, which are based on error estimation. The most popular measures
are MSE, MAD, and MAPE.
Finally, it should be noted that a common problem with statistical methods are the
reliability of historical data and future developments. If forecasting is only based on
numeric data, it is not safe. Numeric data often does not consider external features
such as ecological, economic, or political factors. Assume that demand for ice cream
has increased over the few last years by 10% because of hot summers. The

Bibliography

333

conclusion would be that the forecast for the following year would be high as well
because the company assumes the weather will be hot again. If the company does not
consider weather forecasts in its calculations or consider expert views, the forecast
based only on historical data could be wrong. Another critical area is the forecasting
of product returns in online retail industry. For this reason it is common practice to
combine expert and statistical methods to get safer forecasts. Such methods are
known as ARIMA (autoregressive integrated moving average model) and ANOVA
(analysis of variance).

Introductory Case-Study SIBUR: Integrated Operations
and Supply Chain Planning

The SIBUR Group is a gas processing and petrochemicals company that owns and
operates Russia’s largest gas processing business in terms of associated petroleum
gas (APG) processing volumes. The group beneﬁts from owning and operating
Russia’s largest and most extensive integrated infrastructure for the processing and
transportation of APG and natural gas liquids (NGLs), located primarily in Western
Siberia, which is the largest oil and gas producing region in Russia. SIBURS’s
business model is focused on integrated operations and the SC. The group has two
operating segments: feedstock/energy and petrochemicals. The group’s feedstock

and energy segment include the gathering and processing of APG; transportation,
fractionation, and other processing of NGLs; and the marketing and sales of energy
products, such as natural gas, liquiﬁed petroleum gases (LPG), naphtha, raw NGL,
methyl tertiary butyl ether and other fuels and fuel additives.
APG is purchased from major Russian oil companies. NGLs are produced
internally or purchased from major Russian oil and gas companies. The group
sells these energy products in the Russian and international markets and uses some
of them as feedstock for its petrochemicals segment, which processes them into more
than 2000 different petrochemicals, including basic polymers, synthetic rubbers,
plastics, and products of organic synthesis, as well as intermediates and other
chemicals. The group operates 27 production sites, has over 1500 big customers
operating in the energy, automotive, construction, fast moving consumer goods
(FMCG), chemical, and other industries in approximately 60 countries and employs
over 30,000 personnel (see Fig. 12.1).
The operations and SC planning department is composed of the department
manager, planning manager, dispatch manager, and SC analysis manager. The
planning process starts with demand forecasting. On the one hand, statistical
methods such as time series analysis are applied. On the other hand, experts estimate
numerous external factors concerning markets and suppliers. Demand forecast
quality is crucial for planning quality, since small errors in the demand forecast
can lead to huge deviations in planning and execution (see Fig. 12.2).
A mid-term forecast is available for 18 months, making it possible to start
operations planning along the SC. Operations planning is based on the rolling
planning procedure. Before planning production and material requirements, capacity, budget, and further constraints should be taken into account. After planning the

Since demand forecasts, production, and supply plans are updated frequently, a
rolling planning procedure is implemented (see Fig. 12.3).
The rolling planning concept is based on the creation of a detailed MPS on a daily
basis for 30–45 days for the whole SC. This MPS is updated every 15 days to take
into account the dynamics of real execution.

Production and Material Requirements Planning

Planning Horizons/MRP-II

Planning decisions can be divided into
• Strategic
• Tactical
• Operative.
Strategic decisions are taken for a long period of time, typically for many years.
Tactical decisions use information from strategic decisions and determining
planning policies for some months. Operative decisions are taken in a weekly or
daily manner for executing processes. Such a decomposition is necessary since some
data, which can be adjusted during the planning process (so called control variables),
should be set up for a long period of time (so called design variables). Some
examples of different decisions at the tactical and operative levels are presented in
Fig. 12.4.
Manufacturing resource planning—MRP-II—means that, from a management
point of view, tools are being used for planning the activities of all functions of a
manufacturing company. In the planning process, MRP II means the translation of
business plans and demand forecasts, including customer orders, into production
plans and purchasing plans using planned orders in a real-time multilevel scheduling
environment (see Fig. 12.5).
MRP-II is a hierarchical planning approach. This means that decisions from the
upper levels are used as input data for the lower levels (as opposed to simultaneous
planning which is more complex).
Based on requirements and constraints from ﬁnance, marketing, and
manufacturing on the one side and demand forecasts along with capacity decisions
on the other, aggregate planning is achieved. The results of aggregate planning are
further used for master production scheduling (MPS), which is the base for material
requirements planning (MRP), lot-sizing/procurement order quantity calculation,
and ﬁnally for short-term scheduling and routing.
At each stage, balancing is mandatory to ensure that the results of the upper level
may be implemented at the next level. Otherwise, incorrect calculations will be made
throughout the planning levels. This could result in a situation where short-term
daily schedules would have nothing in common with real demand; the wrong
material could be purchased. In the following, we consider some important elements
of the MRP-II concept.

Sales and Operations Planning

12.3.1 Role of Sales and Operations Planning
Production planning is usually done at an aggregate level, for both products and
resources. The objective of aggregate planning or so called sales and operations
planning (S&OP) is to meet forecasted demand while minimizing cost over the
planning period. The concept of S&OP is aimed at achieving a balance between
demand and supply. Distinct but similar products are combined into aggregate

340

Production and Material Requirements Planning

product families that can be planned for together so as to reduce planning
complexity.
Consider some examples. Zara produces more than 12,000 different product
designs each year. Barilla produces more than 800 different kinds of pasta weekly.
At BMW, more than 1000 different car variants are assembled daily. For such
product variety, the ﬁrst planning decisions should be made at the aggregate level
in order to manage complexity.
Similarly production resources, such as distinct machines or labor pools, are
aggregated into an aggregate machine or labor resource. Care is required when
specifying these aggregates to assure that the resulting aggregate plan can be
reasonably disaggregated into feasible production schedules.
The quality of an aggregate plan has a signiﬁcant impact on the proﬁtability of a
ﬁrm. A poor aggregate plan can result in lost sales and lost proﬁts if the available
inventory and capacity are unable to meet demand. A poor aggregate plan may also
result in a large amount of excess inventory and capacity, thereby raising costs.
The aggregate planner’s main objective is to identify the following operational
parameters over the speciﬁed time horizon (Chopra and Meindl 2012; Heizer and
Render 2013):
• Production rate: the number of units to be completed per unit time (such as per
week or per month);
• Workforce: the number of workers/units of capacity needed for production;
• Overtime: the amount of overtime production planned;
• Machine capacity level: the number of units of machine capacity needed for
production;
• Subcontracting: the subcontracted capacity required over the planning horizon;
• Backlog: the demand not satisﬁed in the period in which it arises, but carried over
to future periods;
• Inventory on hand: the planned inventory carried over the various periods in the
planning horizon.
An aggregate planner requires the following information:
• A logical overall unit for measuring sales and output;
• A forecast of demand for an intermediate planning period in these aggregate
terms;
• A method for determining costs;
• A model that combines forecasts and costs so that scheduling decisions can be
made for the planning period;
• Capacity planning results.
Using this information, a company makes the following determinations through
aggregate planning:

12.3

Sales and Operations Planning

341

• Production quantity from regular time, overtime, and subcontracted time: used to
determine number of workers and supplier purchase levels;
• Inventory held: used to determine the warehouse space and working capital
required;
• Backlog/stockout quantity: used to determine customer service levels;
• Workforce Hired/Laid Off: used to determine any labor issues to be encountered;
• Machine capacity increase/decrease: used to determine if new production equipment should be purchased or idled.
In order to match demand and supply at the aggregate level, companies can
•
•
•
•
•

Use inventories to absorb changes in demand;
Accommodate changes by varying workforce size;
Use part-timers, overtime, or idle time to absorb changes;
Use subcontractors and maintain a stable workforce;
Change prices or other factors to inﬂuence demand.
Application of these methods results in different options for aggregate planning.

12.3.2 Options for Aggregate Planning
In general, a company attempts to use its capacity and inventory to best meet
demand. Therefore, the fundamental trade-offs relevant for a planner include
• Capacity (regular time, overtime, subcontracted)
• Inventory
• Backlog/lost sales because of delay.
There are essentially three distinct aggregate planning options for achieving a
balance between these costs. These options involve trade-offs between capital
investment, workforce size, work hours, inventory, and backlogs/lost sales. Most
options that a planner actually uses are a combination of these three and are referred
to as tailored strategies. The three options are as follows:
• Capacity options
• Demand options
• Mixed options.
Capacity options are based on the assumption that production capacity can be
changed according to demand ﬂuctuations. First, inventory levels can be changed to
increase inventory in low demand periods to meet high demand in the future. The
shortcoming of such policy is that it increases costs associated with storage, insurance, handling, obsolescence, and capital investment. In addition, shortages may
mean lost sales due to long lead times and poor customer service.

342

12

Production and Material Requirements Planning

Second, it is possible to change capacity by varying workforce size by hiring or
layoffs. This allows the production rate to be matched to demand, but creates training
and separation costs from hiring and laying off workers. New workers may have
lower productivity.
Third, varying the production rate through overtime is possible. This will allow
for a constant workforce, but overtime can be costly and may drive down productivity. In addition, overtime space is very limited; it may be difﬁcult to meet large
increases in demand. Fourth, subcontracting can be used as a temporary measure
during periods of peak demand. Usually, it is a costly option with coordination
problems in terms of quality and delivery time.
Demand options are based on the assumption that it is possible to shift demand to
slow periods or to use advertising or promotion to increase demand in low periods.
Demand options include (1) longer lead times during high- demand periods and
(2) mixing counterseasonal products and services. In other words, demand options
are used to ﬁnd a balance between supply and demand by inﬂuencing demand. An
anecdotal example can be given here as an illustration. In a Russian restaurant on
Brighton Beach, the cook cries to the waiter “Pelmeni are ready!” The waiter
responds “Nobody has ordered pelmeni?!” The cook replies “Then go and ask the
guests: maybe somebody would like to order them!”
Mixed options combine elements from capacity and demand options. The common mixed options are as follows:
• Chase strategy and
• Level strategy.
Chase strategy is based on using capacity as a lever. With the help of this
strategy, we match output rates to the demand forecast for each period. Typically,
we can vary workforce levels or production rate. Such a strategy is common in
service organizations.
Level strategy is based on using inventory as a lever. With the help of this
strategy, a stable workforce and machine capacity are maintained with a constant
output rate. While daily production is steady, we use inventory as buffer. Stable
production tends to lead to better quality and productivity.

12.3.3 Methods for Aggregate Planning
Methods for aggregate planning can be based on the empirical knowledge of the
planners or on mathematical models. Since the number of possible combinations of
different methods is very high, a mathematical model would tend to lead to better
results. But in many cases, the construction of such models is difﬁcult, since many
“soft” factors have to be taken into account. One basic quantitative method for
S&OP is linear programing, which allows the optimal allocation of resources to
demand subject to capacity constraints. We will consider linear programing in a
separate chapter. Here we limit ourselves to consideration of empirical methods.

Task 12.1 Sales and Operation Planning
You have to prepare an aggregate plan for the production of skateboards which will
cover nine periods (Table 12.1):
You have 20 workers with a capacity (output) of 10 skateboards a month each.
The production cost is $6, the inventory holding cost is $5, and the backlog cost is
$10 a unit. Overtime and subcontracting are not used. However, in this case demand
cannot be covered by existing capacities. You have the possibility to employ two
additional workers. In order to avoid surplus production of 40 skateboards, you
decide to hire the second worker for the ﬁrst 5 months only. The cost of these two
workers is $500.
We make an aggregate plan and the costs, as shown in Table 12.2, are calculated
under the following assumptions:
• Inventory costs are calculated for average inventory on hand; average inventory
on hand is calculated as 50% from the sum of inventory at the beginning and end
of each month;
• Our customer can wait: we can sell products in further periods to cover the
demand of the previous periods, but for each period we calculate backlog costs.
The total cost of this plan is $14,790. In order to make any judgments on its quality,
you have to consider at least two other options.
Option (1) You can introduce ﬂexible capacities to cover the discrepancies
between output and demand in each month. This will cost you $4000 additionally.
(Note: here you do not need the table calculation).
Answer: In this case, demand and production volumes are equal, and neither
backlogs nor inventory exist. However, the total cost in this case is $15,640.
Therefore, this ﬂexibility option costs more than the ﬁrst option.
Option (2) You decide on subcontracting instead of hiring two workers. The
supplier is able to deliver 50 units in months 3, 5 and 7 at $7 a unit.
Answer: see Table 12.3.
This option is also less efﬁcient compared to the ﬁrst one. In order to make
subcontracting proﬁtable, it should be used for the periods with the greatest backlogs
(4)–(6).

Sales and Production Planning with Linear Programing

12.4.1 Problem Description
In S&OP, overall production quantities and capacity have been deﬁned. The next
step is to decide on the product mix within these aggregate volumes. The objective
function is to maximize proﬁt. The capacity is limited and demand is known: these
are constraints.
Consider an example. The demand in January for plastic windows of the types A
and B is forecasted at 100 and 150 units, respectively. The available capacity is 1000
time units. The price is $60 for windows of type A and $50 for windows of type
B. For one unit of A and B, ﬁve and four capacity units are needed. For production of
A and B, components #1 and #2 are required in the proportion 40/60 and 70/30
respectively. These components are available in stock with 130 and 90 units,
respectively. The production of A and B implies material and manufacturing costs
of $48 and $35, respectively, for each unit.
Consider another example. A wholesaler deals with only two sorts of juice. Sort A
is handled in barrels of 20 L. Sort B is handled in full boxes of 10 L per box. Since no
chemical additives are used, refrigerated storage is needed. The capacity of this
refrigerator is 10,000 units. Maximal storage time is 1 month. The producer of juice
A is able to deliver 450 barrels a month max. The producer of juice B is able to
deliver 400 boxes a month max. The proﬁt from one barrel sold is $1 and for one box
sold is $2.
Both companies have to decide on quantities A and B in order to maximize their
proﬁt subject to demand and capacity constraints. Such problems can be represented
as linear optimization problems with some decision variables and constraints. Our
objective in the paragraph is to learn how to:

346

12

Production and Material Requirements Planning

• represent such kinds of management problems in the form of an optimization
model; and
• solve this model analytically and graphically.
Of course, in real life the number of decision variables (i.e., the number of
products) is very high. To simplify the explanations, we will consider cases with
two variables (i.e., products A and B).

12.4.2 Method: Linear Programming
Linear programing (LP) is a widely used quantitative analysis tool which supports
SCOM decisions about allocating available resources subject to demand in order to
maximize proﬁt or minimize costs (e.g., in the transportation problem). The following is characteristic for LP models and describes its requirements and assumptions:
• an objective function that describes the management goal (e.g., proﬁt
maximization);
• constraints that limit the degree to which we can pursue our objective;
• alternative ways for resource allocation;
• both objective and constraints must be expressed as linear functions.
Let us formulate the LP models for the two cases described above. For the case
with plastic windows, the objective is to maximize the proﬁt. We can state the
following general objective function [Eq. (12.1)]:
Z¼

n
X

pi  xi ! or Z ¼ pA  xA þ pB  xB ! max!

ð12:1Þ

i¼1

where pA and pB and xA and xB are the proﬁts and quantities of products A and B,
respectively.
Since the price for A is $60 and the variable costs are $48, pA ¼ $12. Similarly,
pB ¼ $15. We can rewrite the objective function as follows (Eq. 12.2):
Z ¼ 12xA þ 15xB ! max!

ð12:2Þ

What is the maximal possible value of the objective function? Without having
any constraints, the proﬁt can be unlimited if we decide to produce an unlimited
quantity of product B. However, we have limited demand and capacity and have
therefore to consider a constraint system. The solution to this constraint system will
allow us to ﬁnd such quantities as xA and xB, such that the Z-value will be the
maximal possible proﬁt under the considered constraints, prices and costs.
The constraint system is general form can be written as follows (Eqs. 12.3–12.5):

12.4

Production capacity :

ð12:3Þ

i¼1

ð12:4Þ

Non-negativity constraint : xA , xB  0

ð12:5Þ

where
CA and CB is the number of capacity units required for production of one unit of A
and B, respectively.
Ctotal is the overall available capacity, and.
DA and DB is the demand for A and B respectively.
The constraint system for the case with plastic windows can be therefore written
in the following way (Eqs. 12.6–12.9):
Production capacity : 5xA þ 4xB  1000

ð12:6Þ

Demand : xA  100; xB  150

Additional constraints for components:
Component 1 : 0:4xA þ 0:7xB  130;Component 2 : 0:6xA þ 0:3xB  90 ð12:9Þ
Similarly, we can formulate the LP model for the case with the juice wholesaler
(Eqs. 12.10–12.14):
Objective function : Z ¼ 1xA þ 2xB ! max!

Storage capacity : 20xA þ 10xB  10, 000

Practical Insights For such LP models, different solution techniques
exist. In real-life cases, special software, such as CPLEX, Lindo, AMPL,
Matlab, GAMS, Gurobi, XPRESS, etc., are used. All these software apply

348

12

Production and Material Requirements Planning

solution algorithms based on the simplex method and modern advanced
computational techniques. LP is really a working tool used in practice.

12.4.3 Graphical Solution
In this paragraph, we will consider a graphical solution method for LP models. First,
we must identify a set of feasible solutions. To do this, we plot the constraints on a
graph. The variables xA and xB are plotted as the horizontal and vertical axes,
respectively. Consider the solution to the case with plastic windows. To plot the
line for Eq. (12.6), we need to deﬁne the points where the line 5xA + 4xB  1000
intersects the xA and xB axes. When xA ¼ 0, xB ¼ 250. When xB ¼ 0, xA ¼ 200.
Similarly, we do this for the lines subject to Eq. (12.9), see Fig. 12.6.
It can be observed that a feasible region is formed by four lines: demand A,
demand B, component #1, and component #2. According to the corner-point
solution method, the optimal solution belongs to one of the corner points in the
feasible regions. For example, take point (100;0). For this point the proﬁt is
12  100 + 15  0 ¼ $1200. We have to calculate the proﬁt at different corner points.
Having done this, we will get maximal proﬁt at xA ¼ 80 and xB ¼ 140 units. The
objective function is in this case 12  80 + 15  140 ¼ $3060. We can also observe
that only 960 of 1000 available capacity units will be used. This is because of the
limited component quantities.
Consider the second case about the juice wholesaler. We plot the constraints in
the same way as for the ﬁrst case, but solve this task with the help of another method,
namely the iso-proﬁt line method (see Figs. 12.7 and 12.8). We deﬁne the decision
variables for products A and B as x1 and x2 respectively. The constraints (12.11)–
(12.13) are marked as NB1–NB3, respectively.
Having deﬁned the feasible region, the iso-proﬁt line is now used to ﬁnd the
optimal solution. We start by letting the proﬁt be equal to some arbitrary amount,
that is, selecting a relatively small value. In our example, letting the proﬁt be $500,
we get the iso-proﬁt line G500 (see Fig. 12.8).
The farther we move the iso-proﬁt line from the origin, the higher our proﬁt will
be. In our case the highest possible proﬁt of $1100 will be achieved at x1 ¼ 300 and
x2 ¼ 400.
"

Practical Insights In SCOM, managers are typically interested not only in
the optimal solution, but also in an assessment of its robustness, since
many risks and uncertainties can influence the input parameters, such as
capacity, material supply, and demand. An analysis of how sensitive the
optimal solution is regarding changes in demand and supply is called a
sensitivity analysis. Sensitivity analysis is a standard tool in LP solvers.

Master Production Schedule and Rolling Planning

12.5.1 Master Production Schedule
Master production schedule (MPS) speciﬁes what is to be made and when in
accordance with the aggregate production plan. The MPS is the main result of the
production planning process. If aggregate planning works with product families,
MPS disaggregates them. MPS is established in terms of speciﬁc products. For
example, aggregate planning determined that 2000 tables should be produced in
August. MPS determines that in the ﬁrst week 600 tables, in the second week
400 tables, in the third week 700 tables, and in the fourth week 300 tables will be
produced.
"

Practical Insights In practice, the MPS is quite often fixed or “frozen” in
the near term part of the plan. For example, in the automotive industry, a
so called “pearl chain” concept is used. The sequence of car production is
fixed for 7 days and remains unchanged throughout the whole

production cycle. This allows the efficiency of manufacturing to be
increased, capacity balancing to be improved, and the planning process
made more convenient for managers.

12.5.2 Rolling Planning
Planning at the MPS level is typically done in a rolling or (adaptive) horizon fashion.
Rolling planning is a continuous, event-driven, real-time (re)planning, and control
process. It uses not only simple open time slots (in contrast to incremental planning),
but also employs conﬂict-driven plan changes during system execution (see
Fig. 12.9). Rolling (or adaptive) planning is a method of planning in which a plan
is modiﬁed periodically by a change in the system parameters or the characteristics
of control inﬂuences the basis of information feedback about a current system state,
the past, and the updated forecasts for the future.
In adaptive planning, the precision of planning decisions decreases moving away
from the decision point (see Figs. 12.9 and 12.10). As shown in Figs. 12.9 and 12.10,
planning decisions become fuzzier with increasing distance from the decisionmaking point. This may be interpreted as a sequence of inter-inserted funnels. At
certain intervals, the plans are updated, the “fuzzy” part of the plans becomes
precise, and a new funnel for the further process course appears.
Such an approach provides the required ﬂexibility with regard to dynamics and
uncertainty. Hence, adaptive planning implies problem resolution and redeﬁnition
through the learning process, rather than problem solving. This allows us to interpret
planning and scheduling not as discrete operations, but as a continuous adaptive
process. The adaptive planning procedure can be interconnected with the adaptive
procedure. This allows reaction to disruptions in SCs (unplanned regulations),
i.e. replanning in real-time.
If there is not sufﬁciently full information about the system and operation
dynamics, certain key operations and events must be determined, of which the
uncertainty of states does not allow operation plans to be formed. As a result, a
number of alternative operation dynamics scenarios can be elaborated. Further, with
time, the uncertain (at the time of planning) operations’ states become certain and
possess certain characteristics (parameters).

Material Requirements Planning

Each of us sometimes buys furniture which should be assembled at home. For
assistance, we get directions which explain to us:
• Which items are contained in the package and in what quantity;
• How these items can be assembled;
• Which items are necessary for sub-assembly;

• In which sequence we should perform sub-assemblies and ﬁnal assembly;
• How much time is needed for sub-assemblies and ﬁnal assembly.
You can observe from the assembly instructions that:
• We have a list of materials needed and their interrelations;
• We can determine the quantity of items required for furniture assembly.
In terms of operations management, we would describe this case as follows:

• We have a bill-of-materials (BOM).
• We have performed material requirements planning (MRP).
If the demand for one item is related to the demand for another item, we call it
dependant demand. Given a quantity for the end item, the demand for all parts and
components can be calculated. For any product for which a schedule can be
established, dependent demand techniques should be used. The most common
techniques in this area are BOM and MRP.

12.6.1 Bill-of-Materials
First, the BOM is a list of the components, ingredients, and materials needed to make
a product. Second, the BOM provides a product structure (see Fig. 12.11). This
structure can be re-written more simply if we depict the number of items requires for
one unit at the upper level (see Fig. 12.11). From the product structure, we can
determine how many items are required at different levels of the BOM (Fig. 12.12)
(see Table 12.4).
This is important for synchronizing manufacturing and procurement since we can
produce items at the upper level only after the items from the lower level have been
purchased or manufactured.
From the product structure, we can also determine the total quantity of all items. If
we perform this procedure, we explode the BOM. For the given structure, we can
explode the BOM as shown in Table 12.5.
Consider as an example the total requirements for material #2 (M2). Three pieces
are needed for one component #12. In turn, three pieces of component #12 are
needed for one module #1, and one module #1 is needed for one end item. So the
dependant demand on M2 is now 3  3  1 ¼ 9 pieces. In addition, one piece of M2 is
needed for one component #21, and four components #21 are needed for one module
#2. Two modules #2 are needed for one end item. So the dependant demand on M2 is
now 9 + 14  2 ¼ 17 pieces.
Exploding the BOM is important for manufacturing and procurement and determining the aggregate quantities for production and purchasing. This data is needed
for production and procurement planning.
"

Practical Insights In practice, BOM calculation is a complex task. A
Mercedes-Benz (SL) is composed of nearly 9100 items. 600 kg of steel
and 25 kg of color are needed. An Airbus is composed on average of
more than 4000 items. Even if only one item is missing, delivery and
production delays can occur. BOM and MRP calculations are automated
in the ERP system. For really complex products, these procedures are
integrated within CAD (computer-aided design) and PDM (product data
management) systems. In addition, so called module BOMs are typical for

complex products. This means that the BOM is created separately for
each module.

12.6.2 MRP Calculation
With the help of the BOM, the product structure is deﬁned. However, manufacturing
and procurement of items does not happen immediately. This requires a certain lead
time. For production, lead time is the sum of the order, wait, move, setup, store, and
run times. For purchased items, lead time is the time between the recognition of a

need and the availability of the item for production. The lead time is taken into
account to calculate MRP.
For MRP calculations, the following data are required:
•
•
•
•
•

MPS
BOM
Inventory availability
Purchase orders outstanding (scheduled receipts)
Lead/manufacturing times for each item.

On the basis of this data, the MRP system calculates orders for manufacturing and
purchasing (see Fig. 12.13).
The MRP calculation is based on the following algorithm:

356

12

Production and Material Requirements Planning

Fig. 12.13 Structure of MRP system

1. From exploding the BOM, so called gross requirements on items are deﬁned
beginning with the upper level down to the lower levels.
2. Taking into account inventory availability and purchase orders outstanding
(scheduled receipts), net requirements can be determined.
3. Net requirements ¼ Gross requirement  (inventory availability + scheduled
receipts).
4. Finally, net requirements are used to determine actual order release time subject
to lead time. This step is often called “lead time offset” or “time phasing”.
Consider an example.
Task 12.2 MRP Calculation
An MPS for an end product is composed as follows (Table 12.6):
We are given the following BOM (Fig. 12.14):
We assume that no inventory is available and no scheduled receipts are planned.
Lead time for all items is 1 month. In this case, gross requirements equal net
requirements and the following represents the results of the MRP calculations (see
Table 12.7).
We start with the net requirements for an end item. This data is taken from the
MPS. The next step is to determine net requirements for the items at the ﬁrst level.
Since for all items exactly one piece is needed for one end item, their net
requirements are identical to those of the end item. Net requirements for the items
at the ﬁrst level should be shifted according to 1 month of lead time. Similarly, net
requirements for the items at the second level are determined subject to net
requirements of the items at the ﬁrst level and lead-time shifting.

For example, 20 units of item D in period 2 means that we have to manufacture
20 units of item D in February in order to be able to assemble 10 units of end item E
in April. By processing the BOM by level, items with multiple parents are typically
only processed once, saving time and resources and reducing confusion. We transform Table 12.7 as follows (see Table 12.8).
The above transformation is based on aggregating the net requirements of the
same items over different levels in each period. For example, in period #2, we
aggregated net requirements for item #2 from the second level (30) and third level
(80). Net requirement for item #2 in the second period is 110 pieces. This information is important for purchasing planning for February.
Now we are going to include inventory and schedule receipts into consideration.
Assume the following problem statement.
Task 12.3 MRP Calculation
You are given the following MPS for table production (Table 12.9):
Lead time for the table production is one period. To produce one table we need
four legs and one plate. For tables, you have received an additional demand of
25 units in period 8, 10 units in periods 9 and 10, respectively. We have 35 tables,
25 plates and 32 legs as beginning inventory. The retailer announced that it will send
back seven tables in period 8 and ﬁve tables in period 10. For plate production, we
need two periods, and one period is needed for leg production.
First, we perform the calculations for the tables (lead time ¼ 1) (see Table 12.10):
Managers frequently use so called closed-loop MRP systems. This allows production planners to move work between time periods to smooth the load or to at least
bring it within capacity.
In practice, managers need to know how to group “planned order releases”.
Indeed, we can order 400 legs for June as one large order, or split this order into

costs and inventory holding costs. We will consider order quantity planning and lotsizing decisions in Chap. 13.

Key Points

Planning decisions can be divided into strategic, tactical, and operative. MRP II
means the translation of business plans and demand forecasts, including customer
orders, into a production and purchasing plans. The objective of aggregate planning
or so called sales and operations planning (S&OP) is to meet forecasted demand

while minimizing costs over the planning period. The concept of S&OP is aimed at
achieving a balance between demand and supply.
In general, a company attempts to use its capacity and inventory to best meet
demand. Therefore, the fundamental trade-offs relevant to a planner include capacity, inventory, and backlog/lost sales because of delay. Three options of S&OP are
capacity options, demand options, and mixed options. Mixed options combine
elements from capacity and demand options. Common mixed options are a chase
strategy and level strategy.
MPS speciﬁes what is to be made and when in accordance with the aggregate
production plan. Planning at the MPS level is typically done in a rolling or (adaptive)
horizon fashion. If demand for one item is related to the demand for another item, we
call it dependant demand. The most common techniques in this area are BOM and
MRP. BOM represents a list of components, ingredients, and materials needed to
make product. Second, in the BOM, the product structure is deﬁned. However,
manufacturing and procurement of items does not happen immediately. This
requires certain lead time. Lead time is taken into account while calculating MRP.
The MRP system calculates orders for manufacturing and purchasing.

Introductory Case-Study: Amazon, Volkswagen, and DELL

The trade-off “service level vs. costs” is one of the most important issues in
inventory management. Its resolution strongly depends on manufacturing, sourcing,
distribution, and SC strategies. Consider three examples.
Amazon
Founded in 1994, Amazon.com, Inc. is the world’s largest online retailer. It started
as an online bookstore, but has diversiﬁed over the last 20 years selling DVDs, CDs,

MP3, software, games, furniture, food, toys, and more. The basic idea is that
everybody with access to the internet can buy a massive range of products at any
time and get them delivered wherever they want from (nearly) anywhere in the
world. Amazon apps make it possible to buy their products easily with smartphones
or tablets. Their inventory management for books is based on the number of sales for
each book. Best-selling books are stocked in many regional warehouses to enable
fast responsiveness for customers in any region. Books with a smaller number of
sales are stocked in only a few regional warehouses to reduce inventory costs. The
slowest moving books are not even held in stock, but are obtained directly from the
publisher or distributor. Through this strategy, it is possible for Amazon to reduce
inventory costs for slow-moving products and to have the best possible service level
and reliability for their customers.
Volkswagen
Founded in Germany in 1937, Volkswagen implemented the JIT-based SC strategy
in Germany. This means that components and items are delivered to the assembly
line when they are needed. Only a small amount of safety stock is held for critical
parts. This strategy helps to reduce inventory, transport, labor, and administration
costs. Often suppliers locate their plants close to the manufacturer to deliver the
required components and items at the right moment and to reduce their transport
costs. This choice of location reduces the risk of delivery delays and supply
shortages. Examples of these JIT components are dashboards with all the electronic
devices or seats. JIT is normally used for A-, B-, X-, and Y-items. For C-items,
Volkswagen uses a Kanban replenishment system so that they are in stock at any
time. These items normally have low inventory holding costs. Based on the JIT
strategy and Kanban replenishment system, Volkswagen is able to minimize inventory costs.
DELL
Founded in US in 1983, DELL runs a MTO production strategy. The assembly starts
and materials are replenished only after a customer orders. In such a business model,
DELL is able to drastically reduce its inventory. For some components, DELL has
90 inventory turns a year which means that inventory is only on hand 4 days on
average. Such inventory dynamics allows Dell to respond to a wide range of demand
quantities, meet short lead times, handle a large variety of products, build innovative
products, and handle supply uncertainty.

Role, Functions, and Types of Inventory

363

Role, Functions, and Types of Inventory

The role of inventory management is to strike a balance between inventory investment and customer service. Inventory is one of the most expensive assets of many
companies, representing as much as 50% of total invested capital. In SCOM we must
therefore balance inventory investment and customer service level.
Inventory has different functions, e.g.:
• to decouple the company and the SC from ﬂuctuations in demand and hold a
stock of goods that will provide a selection for customers;
• to increase SC ﬂexibility by placing inventory in the right places;
• to hedge against facility disruptions in the event of natural catastrophes;
• to decouple or separate various parts of the production process;
• to take advantage of quantity discounts and hedge against inﬂation.
Typically, inventory is classiﬁed according to the following types:
• Raw material (items which are purchased but not processed);
• Work-in-process (WIP) (items which underwent some changes, but are not
completed);
• Maintenance/repair/operating (MRO) (items which are necessary to keep
machinery and processes productive);
• Finished goods (completed product awaiting shipment).
In making decisions in the scope of inventory management, the following two
basic questions are put to the forefront for consideration:
• How much should I replenish?
• When should I replenish?
In calculating inventory amounts, the following costs are typically considered:
• Holding costs (variable)—the costs of holding inventory over time;
• Ordering costs (ﬁxed)—the costs of placing an order and receiving goods;
• Setup costs (ﬁxed)—the costs pf preparing a machine or process for
manufacturing an order;
• Stockout costs (variable)—the costs of lost customer orders resulting from product shortage, loss-of-goodwill costs.
Holding costs include operating costs, labor costs, material handling costs, etc.
and vary considerably depending on the business, location, and interest rates.
Generally these costs are greater than 15% of the item price, but some items have
holding costs greater than 40%. Holding costs depend on the order quantity.
Setup costs (in manufacturing) and ordering costs (in procurement) are ﬁxed and
do not depend on the order quantity. These costs tends less for e-business

364

Inventory Management

developments. At the same time, setup/ordering costs can be increased in the event
there is a high variety of assortment and market dynamics.
According to inventory functions and types, inventory can be used to manage:
• Economy of scale—this is cycle inventory;
• Uncertainty—this is safety inventory.
Cycle inventory exists as a result of producing or purchasing in large lots or
batches. A lot or batch size is the quantity that a stage in the SC either produces or
purchases at a time. The SC can exploit economy of scale and order in large lots to
reduce ﬁxed costs. With the increase in lot size, however, also comes an increase in
carrying costs. As an example of a cycle stock decisions, consider an online book
retailer. This retailer’s sales average around ten truckloads of books per month. The
cycle inventory decisions the retailer must make include how much to order for
replenishment and how often to place these orders. We will consider cycle inventory
optimization in the “Deterministic models” section (for one period) and “Dynamic
lot-sizing models” section for many periods.
Safety inventory is carried to satisfy demand subject to unpredictable demand
ﬂuctuations and to reduce product shortages. Safety inventory can help the SC
manager improve product availability in the presence of uncertainty. In the presence
of safety inventory, shortage costs or overage costs can occur. The calculation of
safety inventory is based on a predetermined service level. Choosing safety inventory involves making a trade-off between the costs of having too much inventory and
the costs of losing sales due to inventory shortage. We will consider methods to
support decisions on safety inventory in the “Stochastic models” section.
For many industries, some products are sold in high quantities in the summer, and
lower quantities in the winter (e.g., mineral water). Seasonal inventory is built up to
counter predictable variability in demand. Companies using seasonal inventory build
up inventory in periods of low demand and store it for periods of high demand when
they will not have the capacity to produce all that is demanded. Managers face key
decisions in determining whether to build up seasonal inventory, and, if they do
build it up, in deciding how much. If a company can rapidly change the rate of its
production system at a very low cost, then it may not need seasonal inventory,
because the production system can adjust to a period of high demand without
incurring large costs. The basic trade-off SCOM managers face in determining
how much seasonal inventory to build up is the cost of carrying the additional
seasonal inventory versus the cost of having a ﬂexible production rate.
"

Practical Insights It is intuitively clear that car tires and pins have different inventory management policies. However, in a distribution center,
which runs over two million items, it can be quite a complicated task to
find the right policy for each item. Many companies that ask for inventory
optimization want to start immediately with software and mathematical
models. But before starting any calculations, items should be properly

13.3

analyzed and classified. False organization of inventory management is
in many cases, the key point of problems in optimization.

13.3

Material Analysis

13.3.1 ABC Analysis
The ﬁrst step in item classiﬁcation is the ABC analysis. ABC analysis divides
inventory into three classes based on annual dollar volume:
• Class A—high annual dollar volume
• Class B—medium annual dollar volume
• Class C—low annual dollar volume
ABC analysis is used to establish policies that focus on the few critical parts and
not the many trivial ones. This method implements the Pareto Principle which states
that “there are few critical and many trivial.” Consider a simple example. Imagine
that you have ten Lego blocks: two of them are red, three green, and ﬁve blue (see
Fig. 13.1). To perform the ABC analysis, we measure the annual demand of each
inventory item times the cost per unit. Assume that one red block costs $1, one green
block costs $0.1, and one blue block costs $0.01.
You can easily calculate that total inventory costs are $2.35. Two red blocks take
only 20% of the total inventory amount, but they create 85% of inventory costs.
These are critical items in the A group. A-items have to be managed especially
carefully. First, the relationships with suppliers of A-items must be managed, i.e.,
supplier development. Second, tighter physical inventory control for A-items is
necessary. Third, we need more care in forecasting demand for A-items.
Consider a numerical example for ABC analysis.

Task 13.1 ABC Analysis
Quarted Ltd. is a company which sells table lamps.
In Tables 13.1 and 13.2, a numerical example is provided.
We are given annual demand and the costs. To determine which table lamps are in
the A, B, or C-category, we need to calculate the annual expenditure:
annual expenditure ¼ annual demand  costs per lamp

ð13:1Þ

The next step is to arrange the different types of table lamps according to their
annual expenditure. After calculating cumulative expenditure, we have to compute
the percentage of cumulative expenditure. Then we can classify the A, B, and C
items. Assuming that the classiﬁcation is 80:15:5 we can label the different table
lamps as follows (see Table 13.2).

graphical form

We can observe that 150 table lamps generate around 80% of inventory costs (A),
whereas 600 table lamps generate only 5% of inventory costs (C). This relationship
can be presented in graphic form as shown in Fig. 13.2.
From Fig. 13.2 it can be observed that 80% of expenditure is created by only 20%
of demand.

13.3.2 XYZ Analysis
The monetary value of capital commitment is not the only criterion for classifying
materials. Other criteria include the physical volume of items, demand patterns, or
delivery times. For example, in terms of the physical volume of items, it is possible
to classify unwieldy items in group X and small and handy items in groups Y and
Z. The principle is the same as for the ABC analysis. Another option for XYZ
analysis is to divide inventory into three classes based on different demand patterns:
• Class X: constant, non-changing demand;
• Class Y: neither constant nor sporadic demand (ﬂuctuating demand);
• Class Z: sporadic or strongly ﬂuctuating demand.
Changes in demand make it possible to determine the prediction accuracy of each
inventory class. Information on XYZ analysis provides an opportunity to develop
strategies concerning alternative stocking arrangements, reorder calculations, and
intervals of inventory control. Consider Fig. 13.3 to understand the connection
between the ABC and XYZ analyses.
XYZ analysis can be used to enhance ABC analysis. A combined ABC/XYZ
analysis helps to deﬁne the purchasing method for different inventory classes and to
determine which parts must be in stock, when they should be ordered JIT, and when
it is only viable for them to be ordered on a forecast basis.
A Hollywood star is constantly complaining of the lack of space in her wardrobe,
represented as Tables 13.3 and 13.4.
Perform a combined ABC/XYZ analysis to help the Hollywood star to gain at
least 50% of space and to reduce the expenditure by 70%!

Solution. First, we sort the items according to their volume (see Table 13.5).
Second, we perform ABC analysis (Table 13.6).
Finally, we sort the items according to the XYZ classiﬁcation in order to see how
much potential there is for space reduction. Of course, we will have to identify
X-items and the percentage of never used X-items, which are primary candidates for
leaving the wardrobe. In parallel, we will have to identify A-items, since our second
goal in this task is also to reduce expenditure to 70% (Table 13.7).

It can be observed that due to the high value, high volume, and high percentage of
never used items, such as the fur coats, dresses, skirts, and costumes, are key in
achieving both the objectives, i.e. value reduction of 70% and space reduction of
50%. Clearing the wardrobe of never used fur coats, dresses, skirts, and costumes
will enable the Hollywood star both to reduce the value of the wardrobe items to
70% and space to 50%.

Deterministic Models

After classifying the items, the next step is to determine order quantities. In this
section, we consider items with independent deterministic demand in the setting of
economy of scale, i.e., the cycle inventory. Why do we need to determine optimal
order quantities? Theoretically, we could order exactly the quantity that corresponds

13.4

Deterministic Models

371

to the daily demand each day. However, then we would also have ordering costs
each day. We would pay each day for transportation.
In most cases, it is reasonable to exploit economy of scale and order in large lots to
reduce ﬁxed ordering costs. We are going to learn how to determine when and how
much to order. We will consider the following methods:
•
•
•
•

Basic economic order quantity (EOQ)
Economic production order quantity (EPQ)
Quantity discount model
Reorder point (ROP).

13.4.1 EOQ Model
Let us start with the EOQ model. It is simple and helps us to understand the
relationship between ordering and holding costs. Consider the system that exhibits
the following characteristics (see Fig. 13.4):
•
•
•
•
•

Demand and lead-time are known and constant;
Receipt of inventory is instantaneous and complete;
Quantity discounts are not possible;
The only variable costs are setup and holding;
Stock-out can be avoided.

We introduce the following notations:
q is the number of units per order;
q* is optimal number of units per order (EOQ);
b is annual demand in units for the inventory item;
f is set-up or ordering cost for each order;
c is holding or carrying cost per unit per year.
Under the assumption of linear inventory consumption, cycle inventory, and
lot-sizes are related as follows in Eq. (13.2):
q
Cycle inventory ¼ :
2

ð13:2Þ

This means that average inventory on hand is equal to 50% of the order quantity.

q
Then annual inventory holding costs is c  :

ð13:3Þ

In order to calculate ordering costs we have to know the number of orders per
year. This number can be easily calculated as shown in Eq. (13.4):
Number of orders per year ¼

q

Then, annual fixed ordering costs is ¼ f 

ð13:4Þ

ð13:5Þ

Optimal order quantity is found when annual ordering costs equal annual holding
costs [see Eq. (13.6)]:

ð13:6Þ

In solving Eq. (13.6) for q*, we get the EOQ formula as follows (Eq. 13.7):

2b  f
q ¼
c
∗

ð13:7Þ

Consider graphical representation (see Fig. 13.5).
It can be observed from the graph that the smallest total cost (the top curve) is the
sum of the two curves below it. Minimal total costs are achieved at the intersection
point of the ﬁxed and variable costs curves. This corresponds to the EOQ point q*. It
can also be observed that total cost function is quite ﬂat in the minimal region. This

Deterministic Models

373

means that moderate EOQ changes will not inﬂuence a signiﬁcant increase in total
costs by tendency. This exempliﬁes the useful robustness property of this method.
We can also determine the expected number of orders per year (Eq. 13.8) and
expected time between orders (Eq. 13.9):

Consider an example.
Task 13.2 EOQ
Demand for the Sakri2 LED TV at Amillos is 3200 units per quarter. Amillos
charges ﬁxed costs of $2500 per order. Annual holding costs per LED TV are $80.
Calculate the number of LED TVs that the store manager should order per reﬁll.
Solution
Annual demand: b ¼ 3200  4 ¼ 12,800 units; Ordering cost/order: f ¼ $2500
Holding cost per unit per year: c ¼ $80
Using the EOQ formula, the optimal order quantity is
rﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ
2  12, 800  2500
q ¼
¼ 895
80
∗

To minimize total costs at Amillos, the store manager orders 895 LED TVs per
reﬁll. The cycle inventory is the average resulting inventory and is calculated as
follows: cycle inventory ¼ 895/2  448 units.
For an order size of q* ¼ 895, the store manager evaluates:
Number of orders per year: N ¼ 12,800/895 ¼ 14.3
Expected time between orders: T ¼ 365/14.3 ¼ 25.5 days
Total cost: TC ¼ 80  895/2 + 2500  12,800/895 ¼ $71,554
Total cost for 1 year is $71,554 for 14.3 orders with 895 LED TVs in each order.
"

Practical Insights The EOQ model was developed around the beginning
of the twentieth century in the era of mass production and economy of
scale. By that time, procurement processes were being performed manually and were quite costly and time-consuming. Today, economy of
flexibility and small lot-sizes exists in many industries and services.
Transportation costs and SC coordination has become more and more

374

13

Inventory Management

important. Procurement processes have been automated, many of them
performed via the internet. A significant part of fixed ordering costs
(telephone, fax, etc.) has been cut.
"

Practical Insights In applying EOQ computation results and inventory
control policies, the practical reality must also be considered. For example, in some cases suppliers fix the dates for new orders (e.g., each Friday)
or allow orders at fixed quantities (e.g., 50, 150 or 300 units) only.

Deliberate the following questions:
• Can we include transportation costs in the EOQ model?
• Is the EOQ of each ﬁrm really an optimal solution for the whole SC?
• For which department is EOQ really “optimal”? (Hint: what happens to transportation costs if EOQ decreases?)
Consider an example. EOQ is 40 units. This corresponds to 25 deliveries a year
subject to annual demand of 1000 modules. Consider the following procedure for
determining transportation costs: 400 € per delivery + 4 € per module. It is possible
to transport up to 100 units at a time.
Costs Analysis for 100 Units
•
•
•
•

Transportation costs ¼ 10 deliveries  (400 + 4  100) ¼ 8 € per unit
Cycle inventory ¼ (100/2)  29 + (1000/100)  23.2 ¼ 1682 €
Safety inventory ¼ 1.65  4  10 ¼ 66 items  29 ¼ 1914 €
Total costs per module: 11.6 €
Costs Analysis for 40 Units

•
•
•
•

Transportation costs ¼ 25 deliveries  (400 + 4  40) ¼ 14 € per unit
Cycle inventory ¼ (40/2)  29 + (1000/40)  23.2 ¼ 1160 €
Safety inventory ¼ 1.65  4  10 ¼ 66 units  29 ¼ 1914 €
Total costs per module: 17.1 €

Conclusion: EOQ is not optimal for the integrated inventory-transportation
setting. At lot-sizes of 100 units, total costs are reduced from 17.1 € to 11.6 € per
unit. For an annual demand of 1000 modules, the cost savings is 5500 €.

13.4.2 EOQ Model with Discounts
Inventory costs can also be calculated on the basis of the unit prices p (i.e., the actual
costs of the material purchased) as shown in Eq. (13.11):

2bf
q ¼

pI
∗

ð13:12Þ

where I is the interest rate (capital commitment) and p is the unit price.
As such, different prices can be included in the analysis. This allows us to apply
the EOQ model for situations with quantity discounts. Reduced prices are often
available when larger quantities are purchased. In this case, the trade-off is between
reduced item costs and increased holding costs.
The algorithm of calculating EOQ with discounts involves the following steps:
• For each discount, calculate q*;
• If q* does not qualify for a discount, choose the smallest possible order size to get
the discount;
• Compute the total cost for each q* or adjusted value from Step 2;
• Select the q* that gives the lowest total cost.
Task 13.3 EOQ with Discounts
Carlo Inc. operates a chocolate shop in New York. The chocolate is ordered from a
supplier in Switzerland. Normally, cost for one unit of chocolate is $5.00, but a
quantity discount is provided by the manufacturer (see Table 13.8).
Carlo Inc.’s annual demand for chocolate is 10,000 units and the setup cost per
order is $50. Interest rate is 20%.

It can be observed that we have the lowest total costs with 2000 units of chocolate
per order. We can also determine the expected number of orders per year N ¼ 10,
000/2000 ¼ 5 and the expected time between orders: T ¼ 365/5 ¼ 73.

13.4.3 EPQ Model
The EPQ model is fairly similar to the EOQ model, but it is applied to
manufacturing. This model is used when:
• inventory builds up over a period of time after an order is placed;
• units are produced and sold simultaneously.
In the EOQ model, we assume that the receipt of inventory is instantaneous and
complete. Now, we allow the receipt of inventory over a period of time and introduce
three new parameters:
• r is daily production rate;
• d is daily demand;
• t is the length of the production run in days.

13.4

Deterministic Models

Setup costs remain unchanged; holding costs are now calculated subject to the
relation of production and demand as follows (Eq. 13.13):
q
c  ½1  ðd=r Þ
2

ð13:13Þ

For example, if we produce the quantity that corresponds exactly to the daily
demand each day, we will not have any holding costs (the expression in brackets will
always equal zero), but we will have very high set-up costs.
Then, the following EPQ formula (13.14) can be stated as follows:

Note: In EPQ, we consider daily demand. If we are given annual demand, it
should be divided into the corresponding number of working days.
Consider an example.
Task 13.4 EPQ
Natural Inc. produces high-quality food processors. It sells 18,000 processors per
year and is able to produce 125 machines per day. Natural Inc. works 250 days per
year. Annual holding costs per food processor is $18 and setup costs are $800.
Calculate the economic production quantity for Natural Inc. and the maximal
inventory level.
Solution
d ¼ 18,000/250 ¼ 72 units per day

It can be observed that the optimal lot-size is 1943 units. At this quantity, minimal
setup and holding costs can be achieved. Taking into account the actual consumption
rate of 72 units a day and the production rate of 125 units a day, maximal inventory
level in the system is 824 units.

Fig. 13.6 Re-order point

13.4.4 Re-order Point
The EOQ model answers the “how much” question. The re-order point (ROP) tells
“when” to order. ROP is introduced to take into account the so called lead time,
i.e. the time between placement and receipt of an order (see Fig. 13.6).
With the assumption of constant demand and a set lead time, ROP is calculated as
in Eq. (13.16):
ROP ¼ d  L,

ð13:16Þ

where d is daily demand and L is lead time.
Note: In ROP, we consider daily demand. If we are given annual demand it
should be divided into the corresponding number of working days in a year.
Consider an example.
Task 13.5 Re-order Point
A company experiences an annual demand of 8500 cheese knives per year
(250 working days). Lead time for an order is ﬁve working days. Calculate the
ROP and explain its meaning.
Solution
1. Daily demand ¼ 8500/250 ¼ 34 units
2. ROP ¼ 34  5 ¼ 170 units
If our inventory reaches 170 cheese knives, then we have to place a new order.

13.5

Stochastic Models

We already know how to determine order quantities and ROPs for situations where
demand and lead time are deterministic. However, in many practical cases, both
demand and lead time ﬂuctuate. We do not know their values, but can only estimate

13.5

them on the basis of probability. For such cases, stochastic (probabilistic) models
are needed.

13.5.1 Service Level and Safety Stock
Imagine that one Saturday evening you are sitting at home and notice that you have
only 16 nappies left for your baby. You are in a province city in Germany where all
stores are closed on Sunday. You recall that normally you need eight nappies a day.
Normally, you would need three nappies for the rest of Saturday, eight for Sunday,
and three for Monday morning until the stores open again. So normally 16 nappies
would be enough and you would not need to go out now to buy a new pack of
nappies (the stores close in 1 h and it is rainy). But what will happen if the demand
for nappies increases and deviates from the mean value? So here the trade-off in your
decision is to balance the risk of being out of stock and the additional costs for
driving the car to the store and spending your time buying nappies.
Uncertainty in demand makes it necessary in SCOM to maintain a certain
customer service level or level of product availability to avoid stock-outs. The
level of product availability is the fraction of demand that is served on time from a
product held in inventory. A high level of product availability provides a high level
of responsiveness, but increases costs because much inventory is held, but rarely
used. In contrast, a low level of product availability lowers inventory holding cost,
but results in a higher fraction of customers who are not served on time. The basic
trade-off when determining the level of product availability is between the cost of
inventory to increase product availability and the loss from not serving customers
on time.
For example, a 0.05 probability of stock-out corresponds to a 95% service level
(see Fig. 13.7).
"

Practical Insights In practice, different service level estimations are used.
For example, anyLogistix software uses three service level indicators
(Ivanov 2017):

• The Alpha service level measures the probability that all customer
orders that arrive within a given time interval will be completely
delivered from stock on hand. In other words, a lack of stock will not
delay the deliveries.
• The Beta service level is a quantity-oriented service level with consideration of backordering.
• The Lead Time service level is the ratio of orders delivered to the
customers within the expected lead time to total orders.

Heizer and Render (2013)

Fig. 13.8 Actual and ideal inventory behavior

In the further course of this Chapter, we will focus on the Alpha service level. In a
situation of demand uncertainty, safety inventory is introduced with the objective to
ensure product availability even in the case of demand ﬂuctuations. Consider an
example in Figs. 13.8–13.10 based on practice of inventory control in software
anyLogistix.
Assume that we use Eqs. (13.12) and (13.16) to compute EOQ and ROP,
respectively. The dashed line in Fig. 13.8 reﬂects the inventory dynamics in the
case of using optimal EOQ and ROP and can be named as an ideal inventory
behavior. The ideal inventory behavior means in this case that all assumptions of
EOQ and ROP models subject to Eqs. (13.12) and (13.16) are met, i.e., demand and
lead-time are constant. In reality, this is not the case. Both demand and lead-time
ﬂuctuate resulting in actual inventory behavior which is different as the ideal one.
In order to cope with this situation, the ROP should be increased by the safety
stock. Consider Figs. 13.9 and 13.10.
In Fig. 13.9, the ROP from Fig. 13.8 is increased by safety stock. It considers an
example where safety stock allows to cope with demand ﬂuctuations in some cases.
However, in other cases there exists a backlog. Figure 13.10 shows an example

13.5

Stochastic Models

381

Fig. 13.9 ROP with safety stock and backlogs

Fig. 13.10 ROP with excessive safety stock and without backlogs

where ROP from Fig. 13.9 is increased by an excessive safety stock (ESS). The ESS
is so high that demand ﬂuctuations would never result in a backlog which means a
100% product availability on stock resulting in a 100% service level. However, the
inventory level in Fig. 13.10 is much higher as compared to Figs. 13.8 and 13.9
resulting in higher inventory costs.
The question is how much safety stock should we plan to ﬁnd a right balance
between the inventory investment and customer satisfaction? Technically, the safety
stock computation is based on the desired service level and demand volatility (see
Fig. 13.7 and Eq. 13.17).
It can be observed from Fig. 13.9 that ROP is enlarged by the safety stock subject
to a 95% service level.
In order to compute safety stock subject to a desired service level, Eq. (13.17) is
used:

382

13

Inventory Management

Table 13.9 Table of normal distribution

ss ¼ z  σ dLT ,

ð13:17Þ

where ss is safety stock, σ dLT is standard deviation of demand during lead-time and
z is the number of standard deviations.
Demand deviation can be gleaned, e.g., from analysis of demand forecasts and
actual sales in the past. For example, σ ¼ 1.25MAD is a typical value. The Z-value
can easily be determined (see Table 13.9).
For example, z ¼ 1.65 for a service level of 95%, z ¼ 2.33 for service level of
99%, and z ¼ 1.28 for a service level of 90%. If standard deviation of demand during
lead time is 10, then safety stocks equals 1.65  10 ¼ 16.5; 2.33  10 ¼ 23.3;
1.28  10 ¼ 12.8. We can observe that the increase of service level from 90% to
99% results in a doubling of inventory.
Another important issue is that stock-outs can be objective and subjective. For
example, the absence of a certain sort of milk in a supermarket does not automatically mean that all milk is missing since other kinds are available. In retail, 3–8% of
stock-out is typical and results not only from false inventory planning, but could for
many other reasons, e.g., false shelf placement.

Practical Insights The service level is determined subject to SC strategy
(efficient vs responsive). The higher the service level, the higher SC
responsiveness, but also the higher inventory costs. If managers were
to set the service level to 100% this would mean that each customer
order would be satisfied from the inventory without delay. However, a
100% service level would result in a huge inventory. This cost can scatter
the positive effects of high customer satisfaction. That is why service
level is typically set at less than 100%.

The inclusion of safety stock changes the calculation of ROP [see Eq. (13.18)]:
ROP ¼ d̄  L þ ss,

ð13:18Þ

where d̄ is average daily demand.
In order to calculate ROP, four situations are possible:
• demand is assumed to be normally distributed during the lead time;
• daily distribution of demand is given (i.e., demand is variable) and lead time is
constant;
• daily demand is constant and lead time is variable;
• both demand and lead time are variable.
In order to calculate ROP if demand is assumed to be normally distributed during
the lead time, formula (13.19) can be used:
ROP ¼ d̄  L þ z  σ dLT

ð13:19Þ

If daily distribution of demand is given (i.e., demand is variable) and lead time is
constant, formula (13.20) can be used:
pﬃﬃﬃ
ROP ¼ d̄  L þ z  σ d  L
ð13:20Þ
If daily demand is constant and lead time is variable, formula (13.21) can be used:
ROP ¼ d̄  L þ z  d̄  σ L
"

ð13:21Þ

Practical Insights Equation (13.21) nicely provides evidence of the

importance of reducing lead time variability. We can observe that lead
time variability reduction directly influences safety stock levels. This
observation depicts the integration of supplier selection, contracting,
and inventory management decisions.

Finally, if both demand and lead time are variable, formula (13.22) can be used:
qﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ
ROP ¼ d̄  L þ z L  σ 2d þ d̄ 2  σ 2L

Task 13.6 ROP with Safety Stock
Average demand for toothbrushes is 35 units per day. Standard deviation of normally distributed demand during lead time is ten toothbrushes per day. Lead time is
3 days. Service level is 95%. Calculate ROP and safety stock.
Solution
ROP ¼ 35  3 þ 1:65  10 ¼ 122 units; Safety stock is 1:65  10

Now we assume that we are given daily distribution of demand instead of
standard deviation of normally distributed demand during lead time. Consider ten
units as daily standard deviation of demand and calculate ROP:

with a standard deviation of 1 day. Calculate ROP.

Finally, we assume that both demand and lead time are variable. Calculate ROP.

Practical Insights Practical implementation of the statistical methods for
inventory management is not easy. In many companies, decisions have
been taken manually for many years on the basis of expert knowledge. In
this case, it can be reasonable to allow manual re-writing of the calculated results in software to start working with new technology. As
practice shows, in a short period of time, inventory managers will see
the advantages of the new system and accept 95% of automatically
generated orders.

13.5.2 Single Period Systems (“Newsvendor Problem”)
The newsvendor problem is a mathematical model for calculating the optimal
inventory level for one single period. It is called the newsboy or newsvendor
problem. A newspaper vendor who must decide every day how many daily

13.5

Stochastic Models

385

newspapers he wants to stock for the next day is faced by uncertain demand and the
knowledge that unsold copies will be almost worthless next day.
The newsvendor problem is characterized by the following conditions:
•
•
•
•
•

ﬁxed price for each unit,
perishable product,
uncertain demand,
no additional delivery in period t,
short purchase time.
Consider the following notation for single period model:
c is purchase price;
r is retail price;
v is salvage price;
co is overage cost;
cu is underage cost;
z is the number of standard deviations;
σ is the standard deviation of demand;
μ is the expectation of demand;
S is order quantity;
S* is optimal order quantity;
Z(S*) is the expected cost for optimal order quantity;
∏(S*) is the expected proﬁt for optimal order quantity.
To calculate the overage and underage costs we can use Eqs. (13.23) and (13.24):
co ¼ c  v

ð13:23Þ

cu ¼ r  c

ð13:24Þ

Then we use the critical ratio (CR) to ﬁnd the z-value from the table of normal
distribution (Eq. 13.25):
CR ¼

cu
; F ðCRÞ ¼ z
cu þ co

ð13:25Þ

0:75
For example, CR ¼ 0:75þ0:25
; F ð0:75Þ ¼ 0:68 ¼ z.
Next step is the calculation of S* according to Eq. (13.26):

S∗ ¼ μ þ z  σ

ð13:26Þ

In order to calculate the expected cost and proﬁt for optimal order quantity,
Eqs. (13.27) and (13.28) can be used:

Task 13.7 Newsvendor Problem
Coff&Co., a coffee shop, sells vegan chocolate croissants. They purchase the
croissants from a small bakery at the end of the street. The bakery sells chocolate
croissants to Coff&Co. for $0.70 each. Coff&Co. sells them for $2.40 to their
customers. Unsold croissants can be returned to the bakery for $0.15 each. On the
basis of the last few months, Coff&Co. expects a normal distributed demand for
chocolate croissants. Expectation of demand is 14 croissants per day with a standard
deviation of four per day. Calculate the optimal order quantity, and expected costs
and proﬁt for the chocolate croissants.
Solution
Overage cost : co ¼ c  v ¼ 0:70  0:15 ¼ $0:55
Underage cost cu ¼ 2:40  0:70 ¼ $1:70

S* ¼ 14 + 0.7  4 ¼ 17 units; therefore Coff&Co. should order 17 vegan chocolate
croissants per day.
Z(S∗) ¼ (0.55 + 1.70)  f01(0.7)  4 ¼ $2.81/day.; so expected cost is $2.81
per day.
Π(S∗) ¼ 1.70  (14  2.81) ¼ $20.99/day.; so expected proﬁt is $20.99 per day.
Note: f01(z) value can be taken from the full version of a normal distribution table.

13.5.3 Safety Stock and Transportation Strategy: Case DailyMaersk
This case study focuses on the impact of a global transportation concept on inventory
management using the example of the Daily Maersk. It illustrates how the sea-leg
part of SCs relates to shippers’ inventory management at destination countries. It
shows that Daily Maersk can offer substantial beneﬁts to shippers in terms of safety
stock reduction.
Maersk Line is part of Denmark’s largest corporation, the Copenhagen-based
Maersk Group. Within the Maersk Group, Maersk Line makes up roughly half of the
revenues, making it the group’s largest segment. Maersk Line operates in the
container shipping industry, offering liner services between seaports. It is the largest
container line worldwide with a ﬂeet of 576 vessels. Normally, customers can be
split into either direct customers (producers) or forwarders (e.g. Kuehne&Nagel,
DHL, DB Schenker) who book slots for the cargo on container vessels to the
respective locations.

13.5

Fig. 13.11 Daily Maersk’s transportation network

In 2011, Maersk announced the introduction of Daily Maersk, a ﬁrst-of-its-kind
concept where daily instead of weekly departures from key ports in Asia to key ports
in Europe were offered. Maersk started by offering daily rather than weekly
departures from key Asian ports such as Shanghai, Ningbo, Yantian (all Chinese)
and Tanjung Pelepas (Malaysia) to Felixstowe (UK), Rotterdam (Netherlands), and
Bremerhaven (Germany) (Fig. 13.11).
Consider an example. The sea journey from Yantian to Felixstowe takes 30 days
on average; now, one departure of a Maersk vessel is offered each day instead of
once a week. We assume a constant demand of 10 units a day, 98% service level, and
a normally distributed lead-time from Yantian to Felixstowe. The safety stock (ss) at
destination (Felixstowe) can be then deﬁned as
ss ¼ z  d̄  σ LT ,

ð13:29Þ

where z is the number of standard deviations, d is daily demand, and σLT is standard
deviation of lead time.
First, an analysis of lead time was performed for weekly departures. It showed
that the standard deviation of lead time for weekly departures is 2 days. Subsequently, an analysis of lead time was performed for daily departures: standard
deviation for daily departures of 0.3 days.
Assuming a service level of 98% and daily demand of 10 units, safety stock can
be calculated as follows:
ss ðweekly departureÞ ¼ 2:055  10  2:0 ¼ 41:1 units
:
ss ðdaily departureÞ ¼ 2:055  10  0:3 ¼ 6:2 units
The calculation above shows that the safety stock level falls signiﬁcantly as a
result of the Daily Maersk concept to only 6.2 units required in stock versus
41.1 units in a weekly service. This translates into lower inventory costs for direct

388

13

Inventory Management

customers or intermediaries, such as forwarders, at destination points and offers a
measurable beneﬁt to Maersk Line’s customers.
Discussion Questions
What impact does daily vessel departure have on inventory?
Daily vessel departures have two impacts: (1) lower average lead time (due to
shorter average waiting time at port of origin); and (2) a lower standard deviation of
lead time (as the increased sailing frequency leads to a high probability of catching a
vessel within 24 h, even if a vessel is missed for 1 day).
Which other factors could be included in this analysis?
We restricted our analysis only to sailing lead time and included no other
elements of lead time (thus ignoring e.g., hinterland transportation).
Why is Maersk Line able to provide daily service and what risks might be
encountered?
As the largest player in the market, Maersk exploits economy of scale, being
among the few able to offer sufﬁcient capacity for daily departures. To offer daily
instead of weekly departure, Maersk Line must deploy more vessels instead of only
one on respective routes, demanding a much higher investment in container ships. Its
environmental footprint can be assumed to be higher, as more vessels travel on the
same route. Maersk faces the risk of not being able to fully utilize the increased
capacity on Daily Maersk routes. This risk can be reduced by re-routing other
services.

13.6

Inventory Control Policies

Inventory control policy is a managerial procedure that helps to deﬁne how much
and when to order. The review may happen periodically (e.g., at the end of a month)
or continuously (i.e., tracking each item and updating inventory levels each time an
item is removed from inventory). Four parameters are important in the setting up of
inventory control policies:
•
•
•
•

t is replenishment interval;
q is order quantity;
s is re-order point;
S is target inventory level.

Since order quantity and replenishment intervals may be both ﬁxed and variable,
four basic inventory control policies can be classiﬁed (see Fig. 13.12).
If the period between two orders is always the same, we talk about periodic
review systems. If the point of time of the next replenishment depends on the ROP,
we talk about the ROP method of stock control or a continuous review system. The
above-mentioned four parameters can be ﬁxed or changed (adjusted) in dynamics
according to changes in demand and supply. Therefore, static and dynamic views on
inventory control policies can be considered.

13.6

Inventory Control Policies

389

13.6.1 Fixed Parameters
When the replenishment interval, order quantity, ROP, and target inventory levels
are ﬁxed, the following policies can be classiﬁed.
Policy 1: t,q
• t: ﬁxed time between two orders
• q: ﬁxed order quantity
In (t,q) policy, a ﬁxed amount (q) is ordered for a ﬁxed period of time (t) (see
Fig. 13.13).
(t,q) is a simple policy for handling the ordering process. This policy opens
possibilities to further automatic control, which improves quality and saves
resources, such as labor, energy, or materials. However, the (t,q)-policy is inﬂexible
and used very seldom in business. Should uncertainty or ﬂuctuation in demand exist,
this policy cannot be adjusted. In addition, shortage or overstocking make the (t,q)policy an unattractive tool for many companies. Thus, it is recommended to implement this policy under constant demand.
Policy 2: t,S

Inventory Management

• T: ﬁxed time between two orders
• Q: variable order quantity to stock up to the target level S
In the (t,S)-policy, the order quantity (q) is variable, and q is placed at a ﬁxed time
(t). We need to order a certain amount of inventory to reach the desired quantity
S subject to lead time (lt). Order quantity is calculated as the target level S—stock on
hand (see Fig. 13.14).
This policy avoids excessive inventory, which cannot be used for any other
purpose and thus involves opportunity costs. The model is easy to use for control
of orders. However, the physical control of the inventory could be so expensive that
the exact count is only performed once a month, for example. In certain cases the (t,
S)-policy can lead to relatively high capital commitment because of the high average
inventory. This policy also implies high ordering costs because we might not place a
large order on the ﬁxed day. At the same time, we might need to wait too long to
fulﬁl our target inventory and thus a shortage can occur. The (t,S)-policy is
recommended for use in companies with cycled replenishment.
Policy 3: s,q
• t: variable time between two orders
• q: ﬁxed order quantity
This model operates when order quantity (q) is ﬁxed and the interval (t) between
orders can vary. In this case, the order point (s) is deﬁned as ROP (see Fig. 13.15).
Every order arrives to replenish inventory after a lead time. The lead time is assumed
to be known and constant. The only uncertainty is associated with demand. In the
following analysis, one should be most concerned with the possibility of shortage
during an order cycle, that is, when the inventory level falls below zero. This is also
called a stock-out event. Every time we extract inventory, we compare what is left
with s.
Note: for calculating the ROP, Eq. (13.20) should be slightly modiﬁed to take into
account the replenishment interval [see Eq. (13.30)]:

Fig. 13.14 (t,S)-inventory

ð T þ LÞ

ð13:30Þ

If the stock level is less than s, then we place an order at the rate of q. Similar to
the (t,q)-policy, in the (s,q)-policy, q also refers to the optimal order quantity. The
policy (s,q) results in shorter time between orders if there is inventory shortage.
Because of its simple operation and full control over results, this policy is widely
used in organizations. An advantage of the model is that it considers demand
ﬂuctuations. Disadvantages lie in regular inventory control.
Policy 4: s,S
• t: variable time between two orders
• q: variable order quantity between the order level S and ROP s
This strategy is used to deﬁne the drop of order quantity s after every inventory
usage. Should this be the case, a manager should reﬁll inventory to raise the
inventory position to the level S, which is desirable property (see Fig. 13.16).
Therefore, both order quantity and the time interval between orders is variable.
This system can handle any level of demand and at any time, and includes demand
ﬂuctuations in planning. Target level is calculated as Eq. (13.31):
S ¼ ðROP þ qÞ

ð13:31Þ

Order policy (s,S) avoids an excessive level of inventory and ensures that the
business has the right goods on hand to avoid stock-outs. However, this policy
requires much effort and high control. It is used in industrial and commercial areas of
business, given the fact that ﬂexible order quantity is possible and a target quantity
can be predetermined.
Task 13.8 Inventory Control Policy
Consider the given data and determine parameters and annual holding costs for (s,S)policy for 95% and 98% service levels respectively:

13.6.2 Dynamic View
When the replenishment interval, order quantity, ROP, and target inventory levels
are not ﬁxed, but change in dynamics subject to changes in demand, the following
changes to the above-mentioned policies must be considered. We have to take into
account demand, current and projected inventory, and in-transit quantities as well as
planned deliveries (see Fig. 13.17).
It can be observed from Fig. 13.17 that both target inventory level and the
re-order point change in dynamics subject to changes in demand. The calculation
basis is the planned days of supply.

13.7

Dynamic Lot-Sizing Models

We already know how to manage inventory with both deterministic and stochastic
demand. However, our previous discussion addressed one period problems. Now we
will consider multi-period problems. Assume that you need tickets for the tram, say
20 tickets for a month. You can buy all of them right at the beginning of the month.
In this case, you spend time for buying tickets only once, but you invest quite a lot of
money at one time. Alternatively, you can buy tickets every day. Your capital
commitment will be lower, but you will spend more time buying tickets.
In multi-period problems, the parameters (e.g., demand, lead time, costs) can vary
in different periods. In addition, inventory from the previous periods can be used to
cover demand in the future. This is why the basic trade-off in multi-period models is
how to balance inventory holding costs and ordering costs over time.

Dynamic lot-sizing models help us to decide in every period if we should order/
produce only for one period or if we should build lot-sizes over several periods
together to minimize order and holding costs. These models can be divided into two
groups: optimization and heuristics. An example for optimization is the Wagner–
Whitin model, which is a generalization of the EOQ model which considers changes
in demand over time. The second group contains the heuristics, e.g., the Silver-Meal
heuristic, the least unit cost heuristic, and the part-period heuristic.
To explain the different dynamic lot-sizing models and show the different
procedures and results, we use the following example.
Task 13.9 Dynamic Lot-Sizing Problem
Sheeran Ltd. has the following periodic demand for a material they need for their
production (Table 13.10):
Orders take place at the beginning of each period and the product is immediately
available. Every order generates a ﬁxed cost f of $100 and there are holding costs
c per unit per period of $0.5.

13.7.1 Least Unit Cost Heuristic
The least unit cost heuristic is based on an average unit cost per period K unit
t . For the
calculation of the average costs for the ﬁrst period we can use Eq. (13.32):
K unit
¼
1

f1
b1

ð13:32Þ

In the second step, the task is to ﬁnd out if it is more efﬁcient to order the material
for period 1 and period 2 jointly in the ﬁrst period. To ﬁnd out the average unit cost
jointly for the ﬁrst and second period we use Eq. (13.33):
K unit
1, 2 ¼

f 1 þ b2  c
b1 þ b2

ð13:33Þ

We continue with this extension until we reach the minimum of the average costs.
This means that as soon as the cost increases we stop the calculation and start from
the beginning with the next period onwards.
For example:

100 þ 200  0:5
¼ 0:2K unit
¼ 0:286
1, 2 ¼
500
500 þ 200

We can see the average cost per unit increases, so we decide not to order the
demand for period 1 and period 2 together. Instead of ordering them together, we
start the calculation with period 2 again and order in period 1 only the material for
this single period:
100
100 þ 600  0:5
¼ 0:5K unit
¼ 0:5
2, 3 ¼
200
200 þ 600

K unit
2, 2 ¼

Because the average unit cost remains at the same level we continue the
calculation:
K unit
2, 4 ¼

100 þ 600  0:5 þ 300  2  0:5
¼ 0:636
200 þ 600 þ 300

Note: since the inventory for period 3 is held over two periods, we multiply
(300  0.5) by 2.
In this case, we might want to order material in period 2 for periods 3, 4, and
5 jointly and start the calculation for period 4 again.
K unit
4, 4 ¼

100
100 þ 200  0:5
¼ 0:33K unit
¼ 0:4
4, 5 ¼
300
300 þ 200

The average cost increases again, so we decide to order only the material for
period 4 and not for periods 4 and 5 together.
K unit
5, 5 ¼

100
100 þ 100  0:5
¼ 0:5K unit
¼ 0:5
5, 6 ¼
200
200 þ 100

In the result, order quantities for each period are determined as follows:
q1 ¼ 500; q2 ¼ 800; q3 ¼ 0; q4 ¼ 300; q5 ¼ 300; q6 ¼ 0
In order to calculate the total cost, we add up the ﬁxed ordering costs for every
order and the holding costs for every period in which we generate them:
K total ¼ 4  100 þ ð600  0:5Þ þ ð100  0:5Þ ¼ $750:
We order in four periods and in period 2 and 5 we order material for the next
period as well. Total cost is $750.

13.7.2 Silver-Meal Heuristic
The Silver-Meal method uses the average cost per period instead of the average unit
cost. As long as the cost decreases, the lot-size is extended similarly to the least unit
cost heuristics.
For period 1 Eq. (13.34) can be used:
K period
¼
1

f1

ð13:34Þ

If we want to ﬁnd out if it is less expensive to order the material for period 2 in
period 1, we use Eq. (13.35):
K period
¼
1, 2

f 1 þ b2  c
2

ð13:35Þ

Consider an example:
K period
¼
1, 1

100
100 þ 200  0:5
¼ 100 K period
¼ 100
¼
1, 2

2

Now we expand the ﬁrst calculation with the material holding costs for period
2. Because they do not increase we continue with period 3.
K period
¼
1, 3

100 þ 200  0:5 þ 600  2  0:5
¼ 267
3

As you can see, the average period cost increases remarkably. For this reason we
order only material for period 1 and 2 together and start our calculation again with
period 3.
K period

3, 3

100
100 þ 300  0:5
¼ 100 K period
¼ 125

The cost increases again and so we order the material for period 3 only.

As we can see we can order the material for periods 4, 5, and 6 jointly, resulting in
the following solution.
q1 ¼ 700 q2 ¼ 0 q3 ¼ 600 q4 ¼ 600 q5 ¼ 0 q6 ¼ 0

K total ¼ 3  100 þ ð200  0:5Þ þ ð200  0:5 þ 100  2  0:5Þ ¼ $600
The total cost is lower with Silver-Meal heuristic than with the least unit cost
heuristic. In this case the Silver-Meal order strategy is the preferable method because
we can save $150.
"

Practical Insights Silver-Meal heuristic is most preferable in cases with
sporadically fluctuating demand.

13.7.3 Wagner–Whitin Model
The Wagner–Whitin model considers deterministic demand that changes over several periods for one product. This model helps us to ﬁnd the optimal solution that will
tend to be (but not necessarily!) better than Silver-Meal and offer the least unit cost
heuristic solutions. The Wagner–Whitin method provides optimal results for the
periods under consideration, but not beyond them. The basic idea of the model is to
minimize holding and order costs. Unlike with the heuristics, the Wagner–Whitin
method does not stop when costs are increasing in one period, because the optimization method compares different periods with each other.
For the ﬁrst period we only have the ﬁxed ordering cost as K 1WW ¼ f 1 . In the
second step, we want to ﬁnd out the costs for ordering periods 1 and 2 jointly in the
ﬁrst period instead of ordering them separately.
Consider the basic Wagner–Whitin formula for costs calculation (13.36):
"

"

K t, tþ1 ¼ Min Minð1  t < jÞ f þ c 

j
X

#
bt  n þ K t1 ; f þ K j1

#
ð13:36Þ

t¼tþ1

According to formula (13.36), for each period t, all possible options to order for nperiods in this period until the n-period or to not order at all are considered. The
option with minimal costs is selected.
The calculation for the ﬁrst period is performed as K 1WW
, 2 ¼ f 1 þ b2  c. Normally,
this calculation is continued for all possible options. This is remarkable for the
Wagner–Whitin method and differentiates it from the heuristics. It is safer to
calculate one or two more costs rather than build the wrong lot-sizes. In case we
want to calculate costs for the next period, we do not start only with the ﬁxed
ordering costs in this period. We have to add up the ordering costs from this period
and the total costs from the previous ordering period.
Consider the following example to better understand the procedure of the
Wagner–Whitin method (Table 13.11).

In this case, the costs for ordering the materials for periods 1 and 2 jointly

ways and decide at the end which is the preferred strategy.

Practical Insights The dynamic lot-sizing models considered are basically
applied to make-to-stock (MTS) production strategies (see Chap. 6). In
small series manufacturing and assemble-to-order (ATO) production
strategies, other methods are typically used. These methods are based
on bottleneck-based manufacturing control such as EPEI (Every Part Every
Interval) lot-sizing, heijunka or DBR (drum-buffer-rope). Lot-size can also be
constrained by limited storage capacity within the production processes.
In addition, integration of manufacturing lot-sizing and vehicle scheduling
belong to practical trends, e.g., as so-called BIB (batch-in-batch) lot-size.

Aggregating Inventory

In a number of cases, many markets are replenished from the same warehouse. In this
context, interesting trade-offs between the number of facilities, inventory, and
transportation costs may arise when comparing different options, e.g.:
• building warehouse in each market or
• centralizing inventory.
Some important questions can be discussed regarding these options.
How does the replenishment interval affect the safety stock requirement in
warehouses?
A larger replenishment interval results in higher safety stock requirements,
because safety stock is often used at the end of replenishment intervals; if replenishment intervals are larger, it is important that safety stock is available to be used.
How does the replenishment interval affect the level of inventory (and thus the
size of the warehouse)?
A smaller replenishment interval means a lower level of inventory within the
warehouse and thus a smaller warehouse is useful. On the other hand, a higher
replenishment interval leads to a higher level of inventory and thus a bigger
warehouse must be provided.
How does the replenishment interval affect other warehouse costs (such as labor
cost)?
A shorter replenishment interval probably results in higher labor cost because of
greater material handling.
Furthermore, it is necessary to evaluate other factors that affect the decision, such
as the market in which the ﬁrm produces. Perhaps in a smaller market the ﬁrm would
focus on responsiveness rather than efﬁciency, and in a larger market the opposite.
Also other SC drivers affect the decision. Since sustainability is becoming more
important, ﬁrms also have to ﬁnd a trade-off between transportation costs and
responsiveness while considering sustainability.

Inventory Management

Another speciﬁc case is a situation where two warehouses have to be merged in
order to save warehousing ﬁxed and operating costs. How can we determine the right
level of safety stock in the new larger warehouse? Here are two possible situations:
• Two warehouses served the same market previously;
• Two warehouses served different markets previously.
When two warehouses served the same market previously, safety stock should
remain unchanged, according to the formula ss ¼ z  σdLT. Indeed, if deviation of
demand for tomatoes in Berlin is 100,000 tons, it will not change only because we
merge our warehouses. However, if twoq
warehouses
served different markets previﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ
ously, the following holds true: σ new ¼

σ 2new where σ 2new ¼ σ 21 þ σ 22 .

Note: If average demand and demand deviation differ signiﬁcantly from each
other in two warehouses which previously served the same market, the formula for
different markets has to be applied.
Task 13.10 Merging Warehouses
Mr. Tsching has two wholesale ﬂower markets and his most important products
during the Christmas period are Christmas stars. Mr. Tsching has to order Christmas
stars for the next season from his supplier. His markets are located in Berlin and
Cologne and provide Christmas stars for different regions in Germany, Switzerland,
and Austria. The warehouses serve different markets. Cologne serves west and south
Germany and Switzerland, and Berlin serves north and east Germany and Austria.
Based on sales data from the last year, Mr. Tsching assumes demand to be evenly
distributed. Demand for his market in Cologne is 12,000 Christmas stars with a
standard deviation of 4600 stars. The market in Berlin has demand for 14,300
Christmas stars with a standard deviation of 6200 stars. The purchase price for one
Christmas star is 1.12 € and the retail price is 3.65 €. Christmas stars which are not
sold can be sold on to the textile industry for 0.31 € per star. The textile industry can
use the red pigments for dying. Mr. Tsching thinks about merging his markets.
Merging will involve extra transport costs of 22,500 €, but a reduction in ﬁxed costs
of 20,000 €.
Calculate optimal order volume, and expected costs and proﬁt for every market,
and decide if a merging of Mr. Tsching’s markets is a proﬁtable idea.
Solution.
We refer to the newsvendor model considered in Sect. 13.5.2. First, the expected
costs and proﬁt for the non-merged case are as follows

ATP/CTP

John was browsing the internet to ﬁnd new furniture for his ﬂat. After entering the
desired parameters, he had an overview of beds. The overview contained offers from
four suppliers. The prices were quite similar, but lead times differed signiﬁcantly.
Two suppliers indicated 3 weeks of lead time, one supplier indicated 2–3 days, and
the last indicated 8–10 days since it does not have the item in stock but will be able to
produce it and deliver within a week. John selected the offer of the third supplier,
since the prices were almost equal and lead time became the competitive advantage.
His friend Alex selected the offer of the fourth supplier since the price was a bit
lower than that of the third supplier, but lead time was shorter than for suppliers
1 and 2.
Indication of a lead time of “3 weeks” is a signal that the supplier works with
standard lead times. This means that it does not take into account actual inventory or
production capacity loads. If there is inventory or slack in production capacity,
delivery time can be signiﬁcantly shorter than 3 weeks. Otherwise, it may be longer.
Suppliers 3 and 4 apply so-called ATP/CTP (available-to-promise/capable-topromise) systems. This means that they have introduced IT [e.g., SAP APO
(advanced planning and optimization)] which has the ability to check actual inventory and production capacity along the SC and to deﬁne an exact lead time and
delivery date (see Fig. 13.18).

Key Points and Outlook

At the order fulﬁlment stage, customer orders are matched with quantities available in stock and from scheduled receipts. In addition, customer requests for delivery
of a product with regard to quantity, time, and location have to be answered.
The investigation into whether a delivery can actually be made is called ATP. The
standard method of ATP is to search for available stocks, which can be promised for
delivery.
CTP can be applied when conventional ATP checks fail, i.e., the requested
product is not in stock at the respective locations and not available from scheduled
receipts. CTP refers to the planning and scheduling run with regard to work-inprogress (WIP) during an ATP check. CTP checks whether it is possible to modify
existing scheduled production orders with regard to time and order size or whether to
create a new production order, taking production capacities and component availability into account.
Such concepts are used by many online retail companies such as Amazon.
Manufacturing companies apply such systems to manage complexity which frequently involves thousands of orders per day which may be placed for hundreds of
thousands of items. Investment in IT for ATP/CTP can be high, but will be paid for
through the achievement of competitive advantages.

13.10 Key Points and Outlook
In this chapter, we learned about methods and practical tools for inventory management. Let us summarize the key points of this chapter as follows.
The role of inventory management is to strike a balance between inventory
investment and customer service. Inventory is one of the most expensive assets of
many companies representing as much as 50% of total invested capital. Operations
and SC managers must balance inventory investment against levels of customer
service. Inventory has different functions and types. Trade-off of “service level vs
costs” is one of the most important issues in inventory management. Inventory
creates costs, but at the same time it can be used to increase SC ﬂexibility. The
most important costs in inventory optimization are holding, ordering, and stock-out
costs.
In making decisions in the scope of inventory management, the following two
basic questions are put to the forefront for consideration:
• How much should I replenish?
• When should I replenish?
According to the inventory functions and types, inventory can be used to manage:
• economy of scale—this is cycle inventory;
• uncertainty—this is safety inventory.

404

Inventory Management

Basic methods for item classiﬁcation are the ABC and XYZ analysis. ABC
analysis divides inventory into three classes A-B-C based on annual dollar volume.
ABC analysis is used to establish policies that focus on the few critical parts and not
the many trivial ones. XYZ analysis is used to classify items according their demand
dynamics.
For cycle inventory, the basic methods are as follows:
• basic EOQ and EPQ
• quantity discount model
• reorder point (ROP).
The EOQ method helps us to understand the relationship between ordering and
holding costs. EOQ ﬁnds the optimal order quantity for deterministic demand in one
period mode. The EOQ model answers “how much”.
In the quantity discount model, inventory costs can also be calculated on the basis
of different unit prices. The EPQ model is fairly similar to the EOQ model, but is
applied to production. This model is used when:
• inventory builds up over a period of time after an order is placed;
• units are produced and sold simultaneously.
The reorder point (ROP) tells a manager “when” to order. ROP is introduced to
take into account the so-called lead time, i.e. the time between order placement and
receipt.
However, in many practical cases, both demand and lead time can be ﬂuctuating.
We do not know their actual values, but can only estimate them on the basis of
probability. For such cases, stochastic (probabilistic) models are needed. Uncertainty
of demand makes it necessary to maintain certain customer service levels to avoid
stock-outs. In the presence of demand uncertainty, safety inventory is introduced.
The essential difference between multi-period problems and single-period
problems is that all the relevant parameters (e.g., demand, lead time, costs) can
vary in different periods. In addition, inventory from previous periods can be used to
cover demand in following periods. This is why the basic trade-off in multi-period
models is how to balance inventory holding costs and ordering costs over time. Basic
methods for multi-period problems are the Wagner–Whitin method (optimization) as
well as Silver-Meal and unit cost methods (both methods are heuristics).
In many practical cases, EOQ and ROP cannot be applied because of business
policies. For example, many companies in the electronics retail industry have to
place their orders on Fridays on the basis of demand forecasts since this is required
by OEMs. In other cases, deliveries may only be possible on certain dates (e.g., on
Monday). In these cases, inventory control policies are applied.
In many cases, interesting trade-offs between the number of facilities, and
inventory and transportation costs may arise when comparing different options.
This is why integrated inventory-transportation models are considered. In order to

Bibliography

405

take into account actual inventory in stock production capacities, the ATP/CTP
concept is used, which allows the right delivery dates to be determined.
Many additional problems and methods of inventory management exist in practice, e.g. multi-echelon inventory management in the SC. Multi-echelon inventory
management is a way to cut costs and increase customer service levels.
Single-echelon inventory management has some major problems. The SC carries
excess inventory in the form of redundant safety stock. End customer service failures
occur even when adequate inventory exists in the network. Customer-facing
locations experience undesirable stock-outs, even while service between echelons
is more than acceptable. External suppliers deliver unreliable performance when
they have received unsatisfactory demand forecasts. Shortsighted internal allocation
decisions are made for products with limited availability.
The objective of multi-echelon inventory management is to deliver the desired
end customer service levels with minimum network inventory, with the inventory
divided among the various echelons. However, multi-echelon techniques are more
complex. The complexity of managing inventory increases signiﬁcantly. All
locations should be under the internal control of a single enterprise. Instead of
simply replenishing the warehouse that sits between supplier and end customer, as
in the single-echelon situation, we also need to contend with the problems of
replenishing the multi-stage inventory system.
Additional problems and methods of inventory management which could also be
considered for practical issues are as follows:
•
•
•
•

different kinds of service level (alpha, beta, and gamma)
dynamic safety stock calculations
inventory-lot-size problems
inventory-routing problems, especially in the context of vendor-managed inventory (VMI)
• production–inventory–transportation problems
• stochastic economic lot-sizing and scheduling problems with constraints on
budget, capacity, etc.
These and a wide range of other problems of inventory management in the supply
chain are truly fascinating and deserve much attention.

Routing and Scheduling

14

Routing and scheduling are part of the operative decisions required for running daily
operations. The prerequisites are as follows. Typically, we are given known
capacities that cannot be extended at short notice so that resource scarceness cannot
always be prevented. Furthermore, detailed information about the demand to be
fulﬁlled is available.
The central challenge of operative decision making is now to match demand with
the available capacities on a daily basis. Here, two basic decision tasks have to be
solved (separately or in parallel): (1) demand has to be assigned to resources and
(2) schedules have to be set up. A schedule describes the sequence in which the
assigned tasks are executed and at which starting points individual operations are
initiated. The major difﬁculty is to ensure that the available capacities are not
exceeded and that resources are deployed at the highest efﬁciency.
In Sect. 14.1 we introduce a typical case for operative decision making.
Section 14.2 introduces mathematical graphs as a tool for representing decision
scenarios in a network structure. Additionally, ﬁrst insights into the algorithmic
processing of graph-data as the basic ingredient for decision making in network
structures are provided. The consideration of complex restrictions during the deployment of a resource is discussed in Sect. 14.3 by means of the so-called traveling
salesman problem (TSP) in which the sequencing of operations to build a schedule
for a resource is in the focus of decision making. The integrated consideration of
assignment and scheduling/sequencing decision problems under limited resource
availability is addressed in Sect. 14.4 in the context of the capacitated vehicle
routing problem (CVRP). In Sect. 14.5 a short introduction into the scheduling of
the production machines is given. Finally, Sect. 14.6 summarizes the key aspects of
this chapter.

14.1

Introductory Case Study RED SEA BUS TRAVEL

The leading actor in this chapter is Christina. She has just completed her study
program in Global Supply Chain and Operations Management. Equipped with a
recently acquired degree, she wants to gain some job experience abroad. So she
applies for several jobs in the well-known Hurghada Red Sea area in Egypt. After
several interviews, she ﬁnally gets a job at RED SEA BUS TRAVEL (RSBT). This
company offers transport services in the Hurghada region. International travel
agencies book RSBT service operations in order to ensure that their tourists are
moved to their preferred holiday region.
On her ﬁrst working day, Christina is assigned to the planning and dispatching
ofﬁce of RSBT in downtown Hurghada. After several complicated years of business
due to a lack of tourists, RSBT has detected an increasing number of bookings from
travel agencies, but also from individual customers. These bookings can be classiﬁed
into the following four categories:
–
–
–
–

Limousine Services (LS)
Sightseeing Tours (SST)
Airport Arrival Transfer (AAT)
Airport Departure Transfer (ADT)

RSBT receives all bookings at short notice, e.g. on the day before the transport
service is requested. Service (transport) processes have to be set up in order to cover
customer demand. RSBT operates a ﬂeet of (mini)buses of different sizes and has
qualiﬁed drivers. Assignment of bookings to buses has to be decided, and for each
bus the daily schedule has to be determined.
Christina’s task is now to analyze the four products, LS, SST, AAT, and ADT,
and to make suggestions about how the day-to-day deployment of the available
buses (which are the available resources) must be carried out in order to use these
resources in the most efﬁcient manner while fulﬁlling all booking requests. Having
accompanied several transport services during her ﬁrst week at RSBT, Christina has
identiﬁed the core planning challenges in the four business sectors:

14.2

Shortest Paths in a Network

409

LS: What is the shortest (quickest) path through the local street network to travel
from the limousine service headquarters to the airport? How can this path be
identiﬁed?
SST: In which sequence should all the tourist attractions be visited so that visitors
have enough time to enjoy their leisure time in the hotel?
AAT: What is the minimal travel distance to bring all inbound passengers associated
with an inbound ﬂight to their hotels? What is the minimal number of required
buses?
ADT: Which bus should pick up which guests from which hotel in order to take them
to the airport on time if customers do not accept a pickup more than 5 h earlier
than their scheduled ﬂight departure?
Christina is now looking for suitable planning models for the four types of
transportation service situations. Her intention is to make the determination of the
processes traceable, but, at the same time, she wants to ensure that efﬁciency of the
deployment resources is as high as possible.

14.2

Shortest Paths in a Network

This section addresses the optimization of travel paths in a network structure. In
particular, we are looking for the shortest (or quickest) connections between a given
start location and a given destination location. These two locations are both part of a
network, but there is no direct connection available between them. Instead, it is
necessary to determine a sequence of concatenated direct connections between
intermediately passed connections/points that connects the start and terminus
locations.

14.2.1 Outline of the Shortest Path Problem (SPP) in a Network
Christina ﬁrst turns towards the LS business. In the ﬁrst step, she asks the booking
department for data about the usual and most frequently booked places for limousine
transport. Her survey results in the observation that six locations contribute to the
daily LS operations (see Table 14.1).
The fare for an LS booking is calculated based on the travel distance between the
booked pickup location and the booked delivery location. From discussions with the
RSBT customer care manager, Christina has learned that there are several
complaints from customers who think that they have to pay too much, since drivers
do not follow the shortest travel route.
Christina wants to ﬁnd out if these complaints are justiﬁed and she decides to talk
to some of the drivers. After her interviews, she was convinced that the complaints
were not justiﬁed. All of the complaints were a result of a misunderstanding: the
infrastructure in the area is quite different from the typical European street network.
Since all hotels have been built around the populated area downtown, there are only

streets connecting the biggest hotels. This means going from a pickup point to a
delivery point often requires a visit to several hotels. The street network is signiﬁcantly less dense than in a typical European city and “felt detours” are needed when
travelling in the area.
In order to provide more transparency for customers and instruct the limousine
drivers, Christina decides to create a list for each pair of pickup and delivery point
combinations. She wants to add the shortest route to each pair (to inform the drivers)
and the corresponding travel distance (to inform the customers).
In the ﬁrst attempt to compile the desired list, Christina collects data from the
street map. She marks the six locations A to F (Fig. 14.1). Then, she looks for streets
connecting these locations. Whenever she ﬁnds out that there is a street connecting a
hotel with the airport or the airport with a hotel or a hotel with another hotel, she
connects the origin location with the terminal location by an arc, that is, an arc
represents an existing street connecting these two points where the arc direction
indicates the direction of travel (Fig. 14.1). Finally, she appends the length (given in
kilometers) of such a street (section) between two points. From the compiled
simpliﬁed map, she learns, for example, that there is a street that goes from A
(Reefside—The Fisherman’s Village) to D (Mermaid’s Inn), but this street cannot
be used to go from D to A. The length of the street section from A to D is 3 km. But
what is the distance of a trip from E to F? Christina is looking for a comfortable
method to determine the least travel distance (i.e., to solve the shortest path problem
[SPP]) between a pair of pickup and delivery locations not directly connected by an
arc.

14.2.2 Mathematical Graphs
A mathematical graph is a tool to describe network structures. A network consists of
several points and connections between these points. In a mathematical graph these
points are represented by nodes and all nodes are collected in a node set which is
often labelled N. If there is a connection between two points, then there is also a
connection (i.e., an arc) between the two corresponding nodes, say i and j, taken
from the node set N (i, j ∈ N). If it is only necessary to know that these two nodes
are connected, then this connection is expressed by putting the two connected nodes
into a set {i; j}. This set is called an edge. In most situations it is necessary to save
information about the type of connection between the nodes i and j. For example, if
i as well as j are cities served by an airline, it is necessary to know whether an offered
ﬂight goes from i to j and/or from j to i. It is therefore necessary to distinguish a
connection from i to j and a connection from j to i. In such a situation the connection
is established by the ordered pair (i; j) which indicates that there is a connection
originating from i and going to j. If there is also a connection from j to i then a second
ordered pair (j; i) is used to represent this additional connection. An ordered pair (i; j)
connecting two nodes is called an arc. All required arcs and/or edges are saved in
another set, called the arc (or edge) set typically labelled E. Information associated
with a node or an arc (edge) can be stored by mappings f and g, so that f(i), g(i; j), or
g({i; j}) respectively are kept as stored information. The quadruple (N; E; f; g) is
called a weighted mathematical graph.

14.2.3 The SPP as Graph-Based Optimization Model
Christina wants to represent the LS problem setting in a mathematical graph. She
starts by setting up a graph-based optimization model for the network structure
shown in Fig. 14.1. Therefore, it is necessary to represent the given information as a
mathematical graph G ¼ (Ω; Θ; d) with evaluated arcs. The node set Ω consists of
the six nodes Ω ¼ {A; B; C; D; E; F}. The arc set Θ comprises exactly those arcs
connecting the nodes as shown in Fig. 14.1, so that Θ:¼{(A; B), (A; C), (A; D), (A;
F), (B; F), (C; A), (C; B), (C; D), (C; E), (D; C), (E; C), (E; D), (F; B)}. We
incorporate the real-valued mapping d to assign the travel distance d(i; j) to each arc
(i; j) ∈ Θ.
In order to prepare the analysis of the derived graph, we introduce several
deﬁnitions. These deﬁnitions help us to discuss the speciﬁc properties of a graphbased decision model.
Let (i; j) as well as (k; l) be two arcs in a given graph G. We call arc (k; l) a
“successor of arc (i; j)” if and only if the two nodes j and k coincide, i.e. if and only if
j ¼ k. In such a situation, we also say that arc (k; l) follows arc (i; j) if and only if (k;
l) is a successor of (i; j) in the given graph G. In our example arc (F; B) is a successor
of arc (A; F), which means that arc (F; B) follows arc (A; F).
We are now prepared to introduce the term “path” into a network G. Let s and t be
nodes from the node set Ω of G. In our example, s might be node A and t could be

412

14

Routing and Scheduling

node E. Let (i0; i1), (i1; i2), . . ., (ik1; ik) be a ﬁnite sequence of following arcs with
the properties i0 ¼ s and ik ¼ t. We call the arc sequence (i0; i1), (i1; i2), . . ., (ik1; ik)
a path in G from s to t. For short, we call this arc sequence an s-t-path in G.
Lðði0 ; i1 Þ; ði1 ; i2 Þ; . . . ; ðik1 ; ik ÞÞ≔dðs; i1 Þ þ dði1 ; i2 Þ þ . . . þ dðik1 ; tÞ

ð14:1Þ

The length of a given s-t-path (i0; i1), (i1; i2), . . ., (ik1; ik) in G is deﬁned by
Eq. (14.1). In a case where all nodes contained in path (i0; i1), (i1; i2), . . ., (ik1; ik)
are pairwise different, we call the s-t-path a “simple path”.
The property “pairwise different” refers to a situation in which each two nodes of
a given subset of the node set Ω are not the same. A simple path in the graph shown
in Fig. 14.1 is, for example, the path (A; D), (D; C), (C; E). In contrast, the path (A;
D), (D; A), (A; F) is not a simple path since node A is visited more than once.
Using the aforementioned deﬁnitions, we are now prepared to describe
Christina’s task to determine the shortest path between a pair of nodes in the given
network structure formally. Let s be the pickup point of an LS booking and let t be
the planned drop-off point of this LS booking. Christina is looking then for a simple
s-t-path (s; i1), (i1; i2), . . ., (ik1; t) in G with minimal length L((s; i1), (i1; i2), . . .,
(ik1; t)).

14.2.4 Dijkstra’s Algorithm for the Identification of a Shortest
S-T-Path
There is a very efﬁcient and quick algorithm available to identify the shortest s-t-path
in a given graph G. The only requirement for the applicability of this algorithm is
that all arcs (i; j) of G have a non-negative length d(i; j). Applied to determine a
shortest s-t-path in G, this algorithm does a little more than needed: it calculates the
shortest paths from s to every other node in G. The basic idea of this algorithm was a
contribution of by E.W. Dijkstra (1959). For this reason, the algorithm is often called
the “Dijkstra-Algorithm”.
Dijkstra’s algorithm works as follows. Let |Ω| be the number of nodes in the given
graph G, in which we are going to identify the shortest s-t-path.
Algorithm Start In the beginning, each node is assigned a so-called temporary
label value l(v). This value equals the shortest path length known so far (not the path
itself!) from start node s to node v, i.e. it carries the length of the shortest s-v-path
found so far. Since, in the beginning, no s-v-path is known, we set l(v) equal to
inﬁnity (l(v):¼1), for all v ε Ω, v 6¼ s, but we set l(s) ¼ 0.
Algorithm Iteration Dijkstra’s algorithm iterates the following steps |Ω| times.
1. Each iteration starts with the selection of a node k with a temporary label value
l(k). If there is such a node we select node k with a minimal temporary label value
among all temporarily labelled nodes. If there is no temporarily labelled node left,
then the algorithm terminates.

14.2

Shortest Paths in a Network

413

2. The label value l(k) of the selected node k is declared to be “permanent” and will
not be changed any more in later iterations.
3. For all remaining nodes w ∈ Ω\{k} with a label value l(w) which is not yet
permanently labelled, we check the following: if the arc (k; w) is contained in G
and if l(k) + d(k;w) < l(w), then we update l(w) by l(w):¼l(k) + d(k; w). We have
found a shorter s-w-path in G. If there is no such arc (k; w) or if l(k) + d(k; w)  l
(w), then we do not change l(w) and check the next node w 6¼ k.
The following deﬁnitions help to ease the execution of the Dijkstra algorithm for
even larger networks. Let v be a node from the node set Ω of graph G. In step (ii) of
the iteration of Dijkstra’s algorithm, we need to analyze all those nodes in Ω that are
directly connected with v by an arc that originates from v. The termination node of
such an arc is called a “successor of v”. Let SUCC(v) be the set that contains all
temporarily labelled successors of v, i.e. SUCC(v):¼{k ∈ Ω|(v; k) ∈ Θ and k is
temporarily labelled}.
Let (i; j) be an arc taken from the arc set Θ of graph G. We deﬁne i as a
“predecessor” of j in G. For short, we write pred(j): ¼ {i} if (i; j) ∈ Θ. In the Dijkstra
algorithm, we use the predecessor convention to recursively store the shortest s-tpath, e.g. the sequence of visited nodes in the shortest s-t-path. Starting from
terminal node t, we store pred(t) and for the node pred(t) we store pred(pred(t))
and so on (right-to-left path determination).
Let ΩT be the subset of the node set Ω that contains all nodes that are currently
labelled temporarily and let ΩP be the subset of Ω formed by the nodes that are
already labelled permanently.
Dijkstra algorithm
(a) Set ΩT:¼V and ΩP:¼ ∅
(b) Set l(v):¼ 1 and pred(v):¼ ∅ for all v ∈ Ω\{s}, l(s):¼0 and pred(s):¼ ∅, l(s) ¼ 0
(c) Proceed with steps (d)–(g) if ΩT 6¼ ∅, otherwise go to (h)
(d) Select a node k ∈ ΩT so that l(k) is minimal over ΩT.
(e) Declare the label l(k) as permanent and update ΩT:¼ ΩT\{k} and ΩP:¼ ΩP[{k}
(f)
For all w ∈ SUCC(k) that fulﬁl l(k) + d(k; w) < l(w) update l(w):¼l(k) + d(k; w) and pred
(w):¼{k}
(g) Goto (c)
(h) Stop the algorithm

Such an algorithm description is quite close to a computer programming code. It
is written in pseudocode. Pseudocode descriptions are often used in order to make
the “real” implementation (coding) with a programing language like BASIC, Java, or
C++ easier.
The Dijkstra algorithm starts with the initialization of the two node sets ΩT, as
well as ΩP (the symbol ∅ represents an empty set) in the steps (a) and (b). The steps
(c)–(g) are repeated as long as there is still a node with a temporary label available. In
each repetition, exactly one node is moved from the set of temporarily labelled nodes

414

14

Routing and Scheduling

into the set of permanent nodes (d), (e) and the temporary labels are updated if a
shorter s-w-path to a node w is found (f).
Christina has read about the Dijkstra algorithm and the shortest path problem. She
applies it now to the problem situation shown in Fig. 14.1. She starts with the
identiﬁcation of the shortest path between point E and point F.
In order to ease the repetitive applications of steps in the Dijkstra algorithm it
seems to be appropriate and helpful to represent the working data and intermediate
results in a table as shown in Table 14.2. The recent label values are contained in the
columns headed by the nodes. The recent pred(X)-value of node X is given in
brackets to the right of the recent label value. Label values declared as permanent
are marked by *. Each row represents one iteration of the Dijkstra algorithm.
Iteration 0 (Start): ΩP ¼ ∅ and ΩT ¼ {A; B; C; D; E; F}. The label value l(E) of the
starting node E is set to 0. All remaining nodes are temporarily labelled by 1.
Iteration 1: ΩP ¼ ∅ and ΩT ¼ {A; B; C; D; E; F}. Node E is labelled with the
minimal temporary label value 0. For this reason, E is moved from ΩT to ΩP
(“permanently labelled”). SUCC(E) ¼ {C; D}. Since l(E) + d(E; C) ¼ 0 + 2 < 1,
we update l(C):¼2 and set pred(C):¼{E}. Since l(E) + d(E;D) ¼ 0 + 3 < 1, we
update l(D):¼ 3 and set pred(D):¼{E}.
Iteration 2: ΩP ¼ {E} and ΩT ¼ {A; B; C; D; F}. Node C is labelled with the smallest
temporary label value. For this reason, C is moved from ΩT to ΩP (“permanently
labelled”). SUCC(C) ¼ {A; B; D}. Since l(C) + d(C; A) ¼ 2 + 1 < 1, we update
l(A):¼3 and update pred(A):¼{C}. Since l(C) + d(C; B) ¼ 2 + 2 < 1, we update
l(B):¼4 and update pred(B):¼{C}. Since l(C) + d(C; D) ¼ 2 + 1  3, we do not
update l(D) und pred(D).
Iteration 3: ΩP ¼ {C; E} und ΩT ¼ {A; B; D; F}. Both nodes A and D are labelled
with the same minimal temporary label value 3. Node A is selected since it comes
ﬁrst in a lexicographic order. For this reason, we move A from ΩT to ΩP and
update SUCC(A):¼{B; F}. Since l(A) + d(A; B) ¼ 3 + 3  4, we preserve l
(B) and pred(B). Since l(A) + d(A; F) ¼ 3 + 3 < 1, we update l(F):¼6 as well as
pred(F):¼{A}.

Iteration 4: ΩP ¼ {A; C; E} and ΩT ¼ {B; D; F}. Node D has the minimal temporary
label value 3. Therefore, we move D from ΩT to ΩP and update SUCC(D):¼ ∅.
No temporary label value must be checked to be updated.
Iteration 5: ΩP ¼ {A; C; D; E} and ΩT ¼ {B; F}. Node B is labelled with the smallest
temporary label value, which is 4. Thus, we move B from ΩT to ΩP and we set
SUCC(B) ¼ {F}. Since l(B) + d(B; F) ¼ 4 + 4  4, we preserve l(F) and we do
not update prec{B}.
Iteration 6: ΩP ¼ {A; B; C; D; E} and ΩT ¼ {F}. Node F is labelled with the minimal
temporary label value 6. We therefore move F from ΩT to ΩP and set SUCC(B):¼
∅. No further checks are necessary.
Iteration 7: ΩP ¼ {A; B; C; D; E; F} and ΩT¼∅. There is no further node available
that has been labelled temporarily. The Dijkstra algorithm terminates here.
The permanent label value l(F) of the designated goal node gives the length of the
shortest E-F-path in graph G. The path is determined by a recursive backtrackanalysis of the ﬁnal pred-values. We have found that pred(F):¼A, pred(A):¼C, pred
(C):¼E. The shortest E-F-path in G is ((E; C), (C; A), (A; F)).
There is a chance of the existence of more than one E-F-path with the same
minimal distance. The Dijkstra algorithm can ﬁnd only one shortest E-F-path.
Christina can use the Dijkstra algorithm to determine the shortest distances between
each pair of nodes in the Hurghada network.

14.3

Round Trip Planning/Travelling Salesman Problem

Now that Christina has successfully solved the planning challenge for the LS
operations, she turns towards the next open challenge. In the SST department of
RSBT, it is necessary to determine round trips of buses that contain exactly one visit
for each location contained in a given list of sightseeing objects.
Christina examines the SST situation and she ﬁnds out that there are some
similarities with the shortest path identiﬁcation problem which she solved as
explained in Sect. 14.2. First, the SST challenge also exists in a network structure.
Second, for a given list of points of interests, a connecting path in the given network
structure is required. Third, also in the SST situation, a path with minimal length is
searched. However, Christina discovers an important difference between the LS and
SST situations. In the LS challenge, only the starting as well as the terminating node
of the requested s-t-path is given. There are no requests to visit other nodes. In
contrast, the necessity to visit all locations contained in the aforementioned list of
points of interests is postulated. For this reason, Christina concludes that the Dijkstra
algorithm is not a sufﬁcient tool to solve the SST challenge, since this algorithm does
not provide the opportunity to manage the constraint that each node contained in the
network is visited exactly once.
In this section we accompany Christina while she learns how optimization
problems on network structures can be solved if restrictions on the solution must
be considered. In Sect. 14.3.1, the underlying basic decision problem of the SST

416

14

Routing and Scheduling

situation is introduced and explained in detail. In Sect. 14.3.2, a mathematical
optimization model for a restricted network optimization problem is introduced.
Techniques to determine feasible solutions for these models are presented in Sect.
14.3.3.

14.3.1 Travelling Salesman Problem
Christina wants to know if her SST challenge has already been solved by anybody
else. She remembers a lecture she visited during her studies. It was called
“Operations Research Methods for Management Decision Problems”. She sends
an email to one of her friends from the course and asks him to send her a copy of the
presentations delivered in this lecture. Several days later, she receives these printouts
and starts scanning the documents.
After a few minutes, she discovers the picture of a network (Fig. 14.2) that attracts
her attention. The slide that contains this graphic is headed by the words “Travelling
Salesman Problem”.
Christina starts reading the remarks given by the instructor. She reads that the
Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) represents the basic decision task of many
vehicle deployment problems. It is quite similar to the shortest path problem since
in the TSP it is also necessary to fulﬁl a transportation task in a network structure
with minimal resource utilization.
However, the TSP is distinct from the shortest path problem since all nodes in the
network have to be visited, but no node is allowed to be visited more than once
(which means that each available node must be visited exactly once). There is also a
distinct node, called the starting node or the depot, from which the travelling
salesman starts his journey and to which he returns after all other nodes have been
visited exactly once. The salesman wants to keep his total sum of travel distances
between the visited nodes as small as possible.
Christina summarizes these ﬁndings and transfers them to the SST challenges.
She is convinced that the TSP represents exactly the SST problem: there is a set of
nodes given and these nodes (in the SST case: the given points of interests) must all
be visited by a vehicle, but the length of the travel path must be minimal.
Christina continues to read the instructor’s notes. Without going into detail, she
understands that the TSP can be modelled as a linear program (cf. Chap. 12), but
that it is impossible to apply the standard approach for linear programs, which is the
Simplex algorithm, to solve this model. For this reason, her instructor proposes
applying other decision supporting methods called heuristics. Now, Christina’s
attention is awakened and she decides to study the information given in the course
material about the TSP, its modeling, and the heuristic model solving techniques in
detail.
First, Christina wants to understand the case that motivates Fig. 14.2. The outline
of the case study is as follow. A sales representative lives in Hamburg (city
numbered 1 according to Table 14.3). Each week, she has to visit the remaining
13 cities in Northern Germany, which are given in Table 14.3 (cities 2–14). She
wants to visit all these cities in one trip (if necessary, she will have an overnight stay

14.3

Fig. 14.2 Problem setting of the travelling salesman problem (TSP)

in one of the cities) in order to visit all the retail outlet stores of her company.
According to her contract with this company, she has to pay for the fuel costs on her
own. In order to keep the fuel expenses as low as possible, the sales representative
searches for a least-distance round trip that starts in Hamburg, terminates in Hamburg, and visits all remaining 13 cities exactly once.
Christina continues to learn more about the case. The sales representative (who is
in the role of the travelling saleswoman) can travel directly from each given city and
each given other city as indicated by the graph in Fig. 14.2. Such a graph in which
each node has a connection to each other node is called a complete graph. At ﬁrst
look, such a network structure seems to make the determination of a round trip easier
than the determination of a round trip in a general graph like the one given in
Fig. 14.1: Detours on the way from one node to another node are not necessary.
"

Practical Insights A high number of nodes and arcs in the network let
the determination of the shortest path become a management problem
of high complexity. The following calculation emphasizes this statement.
How many round trips are available that visit each node exactly once?
For the first customer node, the sales representative can select from
13 so far unvisited nodes. For the second customer node to be visited,
she can still select from 12 remaining customer locations and so on. In
the given example, this leads to 1312. . .21 ¼ 13! ¼ 6,227,020,800
possible trips that visits each node exactly once. Such a path that
contains a node exactly once and that is closed (start and end node
coincide) is called a Hamiltonian path. Now assume that the identification and the calculation of the length of each individual Hamiltonian

path lasts 1 s. The compilation of a list of all evaluated Hamiltonian paths
would last around 1200 days. For this reason, this so-called complete
enumeration is not an appropriate approach with which to identify a
shortest Hamiltonian path due to practicality.

Christina is happy. She knows now that the SST challenges match the TSP
challenges. Therefore, she is sure that she can solve her SST task after she has
learned how the TSP is solved. She continues to study the lectures notes about the
TSP and ﬁnds out that, again, a model-based approach is proposed to identify a
solution for the given decision task. First, a model for the TSP is needed and, second,
an algorithm for identifying a solution of the model is required.

14.3.2 A Mixed-Integer Linear Program for TSP-Modelling
All N ¼ 14 locations to be visited are numbered by 1, 2, . . ., N in order to ease
further description of the problem (cf. Table 14.3). These locations form the node
set. An arc (i; j) connects two nodes and indicates that it is possible to travel from i to
j. The node set in the TSP is equal to {1, . . ., N}  {1, . . ., N}\{(1; 1), . . ., (N; N)}.
Therefore, the graph in the TSP is complete.
The basic idea for modeling the TSP is that each arc (i; j) contained in the
aforementioned node set is either contained in the Hamiltonian path (the round trip
through all N nodes) or not. In the ﬁrst case mentioned, node j is visited immediately
after node I, but in the latter case node j is not visited immediately after i has been
left. The TSP decision problem can be reduced to the question of which arcs form the
requested Hamiltonian path and which arcs are ignored. In order to represent these
binary decisions, the family of binary decision variables xij (i ∈ {1, . . ., N}, i ∈ {1,

14.3

Round Trip Planning/Travelling Salesman Problem

419

. . ., N}) is introduced. Each decision variable xij is either 0 or 1, and xij represents the
decision whether arc (i; j) is contained in the Hamiltonian path or not. We declare xij
to be 1 if and only if arc (i; j) is included in the Hamiltonian path. It equals 0 if this is
not true.
Let d(i; j) be the distance between node i and node j if the arc (i; j) is used.

In order to ensure that the selected arcs form a Hamiltonian path through the node
set {1, . . ., N} it is necessary to restrict the selection of arcs. First, each node must be
left once (Eq. 14.3) and the salesman has to go to each node exactly once (Eq. 14.4).
It is not sufﬁcient (but it is necessary) that the two restrictions (14.3) as well as
(14.4) are fulﬁlled in order to ensure that a Hamiltonian path through N ¼ {1, . . ., N}
is determined. Figure 14.3 shows a selection of arcs that fulﬁlls Eqs. (14.3) and
(14.4), but a Hamiltonian Path is not achieved. Instead, two so-called short-cycles
are generated. One of these two short cycles does not contain the start node
1. Therefore, it is necessary to add other constraints in order to ensure that a
Hamiltonian path is generated.
ui  u j þ Nxij  N  1 8i, j ∈ f2; . . . ; N g

ð14:5Þ

The article of Desrochers and Laporte (1991) proposed the constraint family
(Eq. 14.5) as short-cycle elimination constraints. They demonstrate that by means of
these constraints and with the incorporation of the real-valued ui-decision variables,
short cycles that do not contain the start node 1 can be prevented.
xij ∈ f0; 1g 8i, j ∈ f1; . . . ; N g and ui real-valued for all i ∈ f1; . . . ; N g ð14:6Þ
Jointly, Eqs. (14.5) and (14.6) ensure that only round trips that contain the
designated starting point 1 are allowed.
The TSP is now represented by the linear program (Eqs. 14.2–14.6). Since some
of the decision variables included in this model are limited to integer (binary) values
while other decision variables are of real value, this model falls into the class of a

420

14

Fig. 14.3 Infeasible TSP solution with too short cycles

mixed-integer linear program (MILP). A linear program containing only integervalued decision values falls into the class of integer linear programs (ILP) according
to Grünert and Irnich (2005).
Having studied the derivation of the mathematical model and learned that the
model consists of a linear objective function as well as a collection of linear
constraints, Christina re-implements the reported problem instance in an Excel
spreadsheet model and tries to solve this model with the Excel Solver add-in.
Quite rapidly, the solver returns a feasible solution. Christina studies the returned
decision variable values. She is worried by the proposed values: she ﬁnds the
proposal to set an x-decision variable to the value 0.25. She asks herself how she
can interpret this value. After a while, she ﬁnds out the reason for this unexpected
proposal: she forgot to declare the x-decision variables to be binary. She corrects this
shortcoming and restarts the solver. Unexpectedly, the solver is unable to return a
feasible solution. The calculation lasts more than 20 min so she decides to interrupt
it, being disappointed that there is no straightforward way to solve the TSP.
From her previous experience, Christina has learned that the Simplex algorithm
fails to return a feasible solution since this algorithm is unable to ensure that integer
values are returned. An explicit limitation of the decision variable domains to binary
or integer values signiﬁcantly prolongs the model solving times. Christina supposes
that in the latter situation another algorithm is used. Her interest is aroused. She
wants to know if there are other algorithmic approaches to solve mathematical
optimization models. She returns to the textbook and continues to read the
instructor’s ideas about solving a TSP-like problem.

14.3.3 Heuristic Search for High Quality Round Trips
An algorithmic approach for solving a decision model by exploiting a rational
strategy of planning without mathematical proof that the proposed (return) feasible
model solution cannot be dominated by another feasible solution is called a heuristic
or a non-optimizing algorithm. In contrast, an algorithm for which the returned
solution proposal is proven to be minimal (maximal) is called an exact or optimization algorithm or approach. The Simplex algorithm is an example of an exact
algorithm. Heuristics are incorporated into model solvers in case no exact algorithm
is available or if the processing times provided by an exact algorithm are expected to
be prohibitively long. Since the processing time for solving relatively small
instances of a TSP is in general quite long it seems reasonable to think about a
heuristic approach for the TSP.
This paragraph introduces heuristics for the management of TSP-like planning
tasks. Two types of algorithms are distinguished. First, we discuss the construction
of a ﬁrst feasible solution for the TSP, i.e. we explain the construction of a ﬁrst
Hamiltonian path in the given network. Second, we discuss approaches for the
improvement of the Hamiltonian path, i.e. we want to reduce the travel length
associated with the Hamiltonian path. Therefore, we need to analyze the existing
Hamiltonian path in order to ﬁnd out which modiﬁcations are promising for a
reduction in the length of the Hamiltonian path. The most promising modiﬁcations
are tentatively implemented and, if they lead to a reduction in travel distance, ﬁnally
implemented.
Algorithms for the Construction of an Initial Feasible Model Solution
Joereßen and Sebastian (1998) describe an intuitive approach for the construction of
a Hamiltonian path. The central idea is to consecutively insert the nodes after the last
visited node until all nodes are contained in the path. A Hamiltonian path is created.
This approach is also known as a “nearest neighborhood heuristic”.
It starts with an empty path. In the ﬁrst step, the starting node (in our example
node 1) is inserted. Next, the node with the shortest distance from the starting node is
inserted immediately after the starting node. This path extension is iterated until no
further node remains. This path construction procedure follows the rational strategy
of keeping the additional travel distance associated with serving the next customer
after the previously inserted customer as low as possible. Therefore, the applied
rational strategy can be characterized as “greedy”. Consequently, this construction
heuristic is called the “greedy construction procedure”. A major shortcoming of the
greedy construction procedure is its myopic insertion strategy. After all nodes have
been inserted into the node sequence, it is necessary to return to the start node. The
travel distance for the return to the depot is not considered in the calculation of the
additional travel distance to serve the next customer. Consequently, the greedy
strategy cannot be proven to return the shortest possible Hamiltonian path. However,
it returns a ﬁrst Hamiltonian path.

Task 14.1 TSP Solution with Greedy Heuristic
Consider a transportation company that has to deliver products from Hamburg to
13 cities in Germany according to the TSP. The data refer to Table 14.3 and the
distances are reﬂected in Fig. 14.4.
Of course, the lengths d(i, j) of the arcs are very important for the decision about
the inclusion of the next node. Typically, these values are composed in the distance
matrix as shown for the example from Table 14.3 in Fig. 14.4. The entry in the i-th
row in column j corresponds to the length of the arc (i; j). Headers are not considered
in this numbering.
Greedy construction procedure
(a)
Initialize: L ¼ 0, start ¼ 1, k ¼ 1;
(b)
Repeat steps (c)–(i) until all columns are blocked
(c)
DEST:¼min{d(START, q)| column q is not blocked}
(d)
L:¼L + d(START, DEST);
(e)
Block row of START as well as column associated with START;
(f)
Stop[k]:¼START;
(g)
START:¼DEST;
(h)
k ¼ k + 1;
(i)
Goto (b);
(j)
Stop[k]: ¼ 1;
(k)
L:¼L + d(START, 1);
(l)
End;

This pseudocode represents the greedy construction procedure that consists of an
initialization phase (a), iteration loops (b)–(i), and a termination phase (j)–(l). During
the initialization phase, the travel distance is set to 0 and the ﬁrst node in the path is
set to the starting node start: ¼1 (home of the salesman). The iteration counter k is
initialized.
Exactly one node is appended to the already existing partial path in each iteration.
Each iteration starts with checking whether there are still unblocked columns. Such
an unblocked column represents a node that has not yet been appended. Among all
unblocked columns (available nodes), a node DEST with the least distance d
(START, DEST) from the last appended node START is chosen (c). Afterwards,
the so far travelled path length L is increased by L(START; DEST) (d). Next, the
row as well as the column associated with DEST is blocked (e). The recently selected
node DEST is appended to the already existing partial path (f) and DEST will be set
to the last inserted node (g). The iteration counter is increased by 1 (h) and the
procedure jumps back to the beginning of the loop (i). If no further unblocked
column is available, the path is closed, i.e. the arc from the last appended node to the
starting node is selected (j) and the travel distance is updated (k). Further details can
be found in the examples in the E-Supplement.
In the example, we have framed the cells representing the arcs (1; 6), (2; 3), (3;
13), (4; 10), (5; 7), (6; 5), (7; 12), (8; 1), (9; 2), (10; 11), (11; 8), (12; 9), (13; 14) as

well as (14; 4). These arcs lead to the Hamiltonian path 1, 6, 5, 7, 12, 9, 2, 3, 13,
14, 4, 10, 11, 8, 1. The length is 1746 km. This path can be found in Fig. 14.5.
Figure 14.5 visualizes the proposal generated by the greedy construction procedure. The generated Hamiltonian path is not optimal, i.e. it is possible to reduce the
travel length. Within the route segment 1 ! 6 ! 5 ! 7 ! 12, as well as in the route
segment 9 ! 2 ! 3 ! 13 ! 14 ! 4 ! 10 ! 11 ! 8 ! 1, a modiﬁcation of the
visiting order leads to a shorter Hamiltonian path. This is not a surprising observation since the primary goal of the greedy construction procedure is the generation of
a feasible (but not necessarily a least-distance) Hamiltonian path. The idea of
inserting one customer after another, even with least marginal costs, does not result
in a least-distance Hamiltonian path.
The phenomenon observed here refers to a general shortcoming of the heuristic
search for solutions if several constraints must be considered while trying to
optimize the objective function. It either tries to fulﬁl the optimization property or
it tries to achieve feasibility of the generated solution proposals. At ﬁrst glance, it
seems that the greedy construction procedure fails for the TSP, but it is worth getting
a ﬁrst feasible Hamiltonian path, since it is possible to improve the objective function
using so-called improvement heuristics that modify the initial feasible solution.
These improvement heuristics focus on the minimization of the objective function
value, but retain the feasibility of the modiﬁed solution.

Improvement Heuristics for Travel Distance Reduction
We design and apply improvement heuristics in order to update an existing, feasible
decision problem solution. During the update, it is necessary to preserve feasibility,
but the objective function value should be brought closer to the (unknown) optimization goal. For a given Hamiltonian path in the TSP, an improvement heuristic tries
to ﬁnd another Hamiltonian path with reduced travel distance by modifying the
visiting sequence as proposed by the construction heuristic. Detours should be
eliminated. The 2-opt-improvement heuristic presented here is based on ideas
discussed by Croes (1958). In its most simple realization, the 2-opt heuristic tries
to reduce the length of a given Hamiltonian path by swapping two adjacent nodes in
the path. Therefore, the swap is applied tentatively. Then, it is checked to see
whether length reduction is achieved. In this case, the tentative swap is conﬁrmed.
Otherwise, the swap is cancelled (Fig. 14.6).
We now apply the 2-opt-improvement logic to reduce the travel distance by
swapping adjacent nodes in the available Hamiltonian path proposed by the greedy
construction heuristic. We start with the partial path 1; 6; 5; 7 and try to swap nodes
6; 5, i.e. we tentatively replace 1; 6; 5; 7 with 1; 5; 6; 7 (cf. Fig. 14.6).
Iteration 1: The sub-path 1; 6; 5; 7 has a length of 354 km. Swapping 6 and 5 will
lead to the sub-path 1; 5; 6; 7 with a length of 367 km. This swap is therefore not
beneﬁcial and it is not conﬁrmed.
Iteration 2: The sub-path 6; 5; 7; 12 has a length of 605 km. Swapping 5 and 7 will
lead to the sub-path 6; 7; 5; 12 of length 493 km. Since the executed swap leads to
a length reduction it is conﬁrmed and the sub-path 6; 5; 7; 12 is replaced by the
sub-path 6; 7; 5; 12.

The existing Hamiltonian path is now completely processed. A length reduction of
112 km has been achieved. The improved Hamiltonian path is shown in Fig. 14.7.
Despite signiﬁcant improvement, we see immediately that further improvements are
needed. However, the required improvement cannot be achieved by interchanging
adjacent nodes, so a 2-opt improvement procedure call is useless. In the situation
reported here, it is beneﬁcial to invert the sub-path 3; 13; 14; 4; 10; 11; 8, i.e. to
replace this sub-path by 8; 11; 10; 4; 14; 13; 3 (see Fig. 14.8). However, the
identiﬁcation of a sub-path whose inversion is beneﬁcial is a challenging task in
itself.

In general, a reapplication of the 2-opt procedure to the already improved solution
can be useful for identifying further length-saving swapping. In our example,
swapping of nodes 6 and 7 is now possible (but was not possible in the ﬁrst
application of the 2-opt procedure). Sometimes nodes are moved from a position
at the beginning of a Hamiltonian path to a later position or vice versa.

Vehicle Routing

Having solved the ﬁrst two operative vehicle deployment tasks (LS and SST)
successfully, Christina turns to the next large business area, which is the local
transfer of inbound tourists. RSBT provides this service to international travel
agencies. These agencies sell all-inclusive travel packages to customers. Such a
package includes
• a return ﬂight ticket from the selected origin airport to Hurghada international
airport (HRG)
• accommodation in the selected hotel in the Hurghada region including breakfast
or half board or full board or all-inclusive food & beverage
• transfer on day of arrival with a pickup at the airport and a drop-off at the selected
hotel
• transfer on the day of departure from the hotel to the airport.
Christina ﬁnds out that RSBT generates a signiﬁcant amount of income from the
transfer services, but the proﬁts are quite small. She discusses this observation with
the responsible division manager. The manager mentions that the transfer of incoming passengers (AAT) is easier to plan than the transfer of outbound passengers
(ADT) since in the ADT setting up pickup times at the hotels has to be considered. In
the AAT setup, such time windows do not play any role.

14.4.1 Case Study ORION: Vehicle Routing at UPS
ORION (On-Road Integrated Optimization and Navigation) is a routing optimization system that suggests an optimized route to get from point A to point Z and all
potential stops in between while also considering speciﬁed delivery windows. It
aims to determine routes by a heuristic that uses predominantly right-hand-turns in
order to increase efﬁciency by maximizing both time savings and safety (therefore
saving on repairs, etc.). ORION uses a database of 250 million addresses,
customized map data, and takes into account different variables such as distances,
delivery times, different types of customers, and package types. ORION constantly
re-evaluates alternative routing options, up to the last moment before a driver leaves
the depot and thereby provides optimal routing instructions to UPS drivers—in the
second phase planned for the ORION project, UPS plans to enable live
recalculations even during delivery.

428

Routing and Scheduling

What Has Been the Business Value of ORION?
Through the deployment of ORION, UPS had optimized 10,000 routes by the end of
2013 and aims to optimize all 55,000 routes being served in the US by 2017. The
optimization of routes has had effects on three dimensions: efﬁciency, sustainability,
and service level. The results stated refer to the pilot year 2013.
By optimizing routes, UPS managed to reduce the total distance travelled by
trucks by 20 million miles and to deliver 350,000 additional packages. Estimations
indicate that a reduction of 1 mile per day per driver for 1 year results in savings
amounting to $50 M.
These efﬁciency gains in turn positively affect the use of resources, as a reduction
in miles travelled causes a diminution of CO2 emissions (14,000 metric tons) and leads
to gasoline savings (5.7 million liters of fuel). At the same time, UPS also increased its
service called “My Choice” that allows consumers to actively choose delivery
preferences, reroute shipments, and adjust delivery locations and dates as needed.
What Are the Disadvantages of ORION?
The costs connected with the development of soft- and hardware as well as the setup
of vehicle routing solutions such as ORION can be extremely high. UPS dedicates
700 employees to the operation and maintenance of ORION, even though there are
no ofﬁcial comments regarding the costs directly attributable to ORION.
UPS’ overall annual budget of $1.0B on technology suggests that the investment
in innovation and improvement of technology is material. Also, the lead time needed
for the setup can often be considerable. In UPS’ case, the ORION algorithm was
initially developed in a laboratory and tested at various UPS sites from 2003 to 2009.
In order to gather the huge amount of data necessary to develop the ORION system,
UPS installed GPS tracking equipment and vehicle sensors on UPS delivery trucks
in 2008. The company prototyped ORION at eight sites between 2010 and 2011,
before deploying the system to six beta sites in 2012.
Furthermore, the complexity of vehicle routing problems in the real world is often
very high, requiring special experts for the implementation of VRP solutions. The
complexity can easily be understood when thinking of the number of possibilities for
determining only one route: an average UPS driver has about 125 customers to reach
a day. The number of options for scheduling a route for 125 different locations is
125! which is a number with 210 digits, which by far exceeds the number of
nanoseconds the earth has existed. Another hint for the complexity of the problem
is the fact that after 6 years of research, UPS was able to determine an algorithm that
takes 90 pages to describe and 1000 pages of code to implement.
Finally, at this stage, ORION is not able to consider dynamic data such as
weather, trafﬁc jams, or accidents which might slow down a driver’s route, and is
therefore only providing an optimal solution at the moment a vehicle leaves the
depot and not later when changes might occur.

14.4.2 Decision Situation Outline
Christina and the manager decide together that because of time, they have to separate
the AAT from the ADT operations planning. Furthermore, they decide to analyze the
AAT setup ﬁrst. Since Christina is not familiar with the AAT business she asks for
an example in order to get an insight into the preparation and execution of some
AAT services. The manager selects a certain day from the last month. On that day,
there was one evening ﬂight that carried overall 29 passengers to the HRG airport.
Different travel agencies have booked the corresponding AAT service at RSBT.
Overall, 14 hotels have to be served. The number of passengers qi to be brought to
a hotel Hi varies between 1 and 4 as shown in Table 14.4. The hotels are distributed
around the airport (Fig. 14.9).
Next, Christina wants to know how the passengers are transported to the hotels.
She learns that four minibuses are available to fulﬁl the AAT services. Each minibus
offers ten passenger seats. All minibuses start their operations from a large parking
lot at the airport. From there, a minibus moves to the exit of HRG’s arrival hall where
the passengers to be served enter the minibus. Next, a minibus goes to the requested
hotel(s) where passengers are dropped off. Within one service trip, a minibus
regularly visits one or more hotels before it returns empty to the parking lot at HRG.
The AAT manager tells Christina that he has the feeling that the performance of the
AAT operations is quite low. In particular, he thinks that the distances travelled (and
therefore trip durations) are quite high. As a consequence, the number of deployed
vehicles seems to be quite high. Overall, AAT operations seem to produce unnecessary travel costs (fuel costs resulting from detours) as well as personal costs (for the
drivers). In order to demonstrate this, the AAT manager produces Table 14.5 showing

the trips executed by the four vehicles. Four vehicles are deployed and the total
distance travelled is 232.42 km + 285.77 km + 204.08 km + 150.81 km ¼ 873.07 km.

14.4.3 Current Approach for the Route Compilation
Having seen only the vehicle trips already executed, Christina feels uncomfortable in
giving a statement about the suitability of the proposed trips. She looks for hints that
support the evaluation of the proposed service processes (the vehicle trips). In a ﬁrst
attempt to estimate the quality of the proposed trips she visualizes the proposed
solution (the trips) in the map provided in Fig. 14.9. Therefore, she connects the
hotels by lines in a sequence proposed by the visiting sequences shown in
Table 14.5. As the result, she gets the route map shown in Fig. 14.10.
Vehicle 1 follows a continuous line, but vehicle 2 travels along the dotted line. In
addition, vehicle 3 operates along the dashed line, while the fourth vehicle follows
the grey line. Christina thinks about generating trips in the AAT business and she
tries to uncover similarities and differences compared to the two previous
investigations. Here is what she ﬁnds out:
1. Since several vehicles are available it is necessary to distribute all nodes
representing locations to be visited among the available vehicles. No node is
allowed to be left uncovered.
2. In order to save travelled distances, each node must be served by one visit, i.e. by
exactly one vehicle.

3. Since the vehicle capacity is limited, there is a constraint that must be considered:
the maximal payload capacity is not allowed to be exceeded.
4. For each vehicle, a TSP has to be solved (a Hamiltonian path through the
common starting point and the locations assigned to this vehicle).
According to the ﬁrst two properties of AAT’s current situation, it is necessary to
make a decision about the assignment of customer locations to the vehicles, i.e. the
set of customer nodes is clustered into pairwise disjoint sets which are called tours.
Each tour is extended by the central position (the depot) from which all vehicles are
located before the trip execution starts and to which all vehicles return after they
have served all assigned customers (all deliveries have been executed).
The third property implies that the clustering is a decision that is constrained,
e.g. some clustering decisions are not allowed (they are infeasible). The fourth
observation demonstrates that there is also a sequencing problem (a TSP) which
must be solved.
Christina leans back and summarizes her ﬁndings. The current AAT situation is a
constrained combined clustering and sequencing problem. In order to ﬁnd out if such
a decision situation has been discussed before, she starts an Internet search and learns
that the current AAT decision was a problem that had been quite well and intensively
studied: it is called the capacitated vehicle routing problem (CVRP).

14.4.4 Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem
Solving a CVRP is the process of ﬁnding optimal transportation routes for a given
ﬂeet of vehicles under capacity constraints. There are different variations of the
CVRP in regard to the speciﬁc constraints that an organization faces. In Fig. 14.11,
the most important CVRP determinants are summarized.
Consider the most important CVRP determinants. First, objectives may relate to
time, distance, costs, or sustainability. Second, the consideration of customers may
be subject to different numbers of customers, demand patterns, and time windows.
Third, the drivers can be classiﬁed regarding different working periods and
regulations for working conditions and time.
Fourth, the ﬂeet can be considered in different ways depending on the size of
vehicles (homogenous or heterogeneous), capacity utilization rules (e.g., LTL: less
than truck load or FTL: full truck load), and depot of references (e.g., the requirement on returning to the start depot). Fifth, representation of the road network may
be different for different CVRP cases. Finally, the depots can be considered as single
or multiple. The solution methods used for the CVRP consider heuristic and exact
approaches.
"

Practical Insights CVRP solutions in practice are typically based on heuristic
methods since the complexity of CVRP is even higher than in TSP. In
addition, up-to-date information technology allows the use of real-time
data about traffic jams, weather conditions, etc. This makes it possible to

14.4

Vehicle Routing

433

Fig. 14.11 CVRP characteristics

implement dynamic or adaptive vehicle routing models in combination with
sophisticated software to increase flexibility and customer service level.

Having learned that the AAT challenge can be represented as CVRP, Christina
wants to know how the vehicle trips (routes) are derived from the requests submitted
by the travel agencies. She discusses this issue with the AAT manager. First, she
learns that all requests are submitted from the travel agencies to AAT 3 days prior to
the due day, which is the execution day. Second, she is told that the consecutively
arriving requests are processed in the order of their arrival (“ﬁrst come/ﬁrst serve”).
Hotel H1 belongs to the ﬁrst request received, H2 to the second, and so on. The
request received ﬁrst is assigned to the ﬁrst vehicle, i.e. vehicle 1 visits H1. The
second request received is appended to this route after the ﬁrst request, i.e. H2 is
visited by vehicle 1 immediately after H1 has been visited. The next requests are
processed similarly as long as the residual capacity (number of free seats) of the
vehicle currently under consideration is large enough to serve the next request, i.e. as
long as adding the next request would not result in exceeding the capacity of the
vehicle. The route of this vehicle is then closed, i.e. the return of the vehicle to the
central depot (parking lot) is added and the route of this vehicle is not changed any
further. A new vehicle route is opened and the drop-off location for the request that
has caused excess capacity is inserted as the ﬁrst customer location in the route of the
second vehicle. Altogether, a greedy strategy similar to the strategy introduced for
the TSP is applied to the CVRP. Two differences must be mentioned.
1. The next request is not determined by the smallest distance increase, but by the
arrival time of the request.
2. A capacity limit assigned to each vehicle is observed. When the addition of the
next request would lead to a capacity excess, a new vehicle route is started.

The pseudocode description of the applied construction procedure for the CVRP
is as follows.
Construction Procedure for the CVRP
(a)
Initialize: START ¼ 0; DEST ¼ 1; k ¼ 1; v ¼ 1; cap_used(v) ¼ 0; L(v) ¼ 0;
PATH[v,k] ¼ START;
(b)
Repeat steps (c)-(p) until DEST > CUSTOMERS
(c)
If CAP_used(v) + q(DEST)  CAP(v) then goto (j)
(d)
PATH[v;k + 1]: ¼ 0;
(e)
L:¼L + d(START,0);
(f)
v:¼v + 1;
(g)
L(v):¼0;
(h)

(n)
START:¼DEST;
(o)
DEST:¼DEST + 1
(p)
Goto (b);
(q)
Return PATH;
(r)
End;

All vehicles start at the depot node 0 and have the remaining payload capacity
CAP[v]. The vehicle currently under consideration is represented by v. The assigned
payload of vehicle v is labelled by cap_used(v), and L(v) carries the length of the
route of vehicle v. PATH[v;k] contains the node that is the k-th customer location in
the route of vehicle v. START gives the last visited node and DEST contains the
node associated with the request at position DEST in the sequence of requests.
The CVRP construction procedure starts with the initialization of the used
variables (a). In each iteration, the steps (b)–(p) are processed. Iteration starts by
checking whether there are still unassigned customer locations (b). After that, the
assignment of the next request to vehicle v is tested to see if it will lead to an excess
in capacity in this vehicle (c). If this is not the case, then the trip length is updated (j),
the used capacity is increased (k), the vehicle customer location is appended to the
existing partial route (m) and the next customer to be considered is selected (n)–(o).
If the capacity test fails, i.e. if the next customer cannot be assigned to the current
vehicle, then the depot is appended as the last visited location to the route (d) and the
return distance is added (e). Afterwards, the route of the next vehicle is initialized
(f)–(i).
Christina asks for the ratio behind the planning logic represented by the CVRP
construction procedure. She learns that this planning procedure is very simple and can
be applied very quickly. In studying this information, Christina is sure that she can
improve the route plan, because the proposed CVRP construction procedure does not

14.4

Vehicle Routing

435

consider any information about the geographic location of the hotels to be visited. This
results in unnecessary detours. For example, she refers to the dashed and to the dotted
vehicle routes in Fig. 14.10. Here, the two vehicles are “zig-zagging” through the area;
travelling back and forth between different regions causes detours.

14.4.5 The Sweep Algorithm
Task 14.2 Solving the CVRP by the Sweep Algorithm
Consider the locations with transformed coordinates (Table 14.6).
In order to overcome the shortcomings associated with the CVRP construction
procedure, Christina thinks about opportunities to identify and exploit similar
locations of different hotels. One characteristic of a customer location (hotel) is its
direction in relation to the central reference point which is the airport parking lot at
point (75; 75). Another characteristic of a hotel location is the distance between the
airport parking lot and the hotel. If and only if both values, direction as well as
distance from the airport of different hotels, are similar then both hotels are situated
close together. However, if the direction components are similar then it is perhaps
beneﬁcial to assign both customers to the same vehicle since detours are unlikely and
the vehicle is already heading in the same direction for both customers (hotels)
(Fig. 14.12).
The analysis of the x-y-coordinates that describe the hotel locations does not help
Christina to ﬁnd similarities between the hotel sites. For this reason, she thinks about
transforming the x-y-coordinates into polar-coordinates. Therefore, she deﬁnes the
grey vertical reference line as shown in Fig. 14.12 and determines the direction of a

the direction line to the hotel side. In column 7 of Table 14.6, this angle is given by
degi of the grey arc (the length of the circumference of a complete circle ¼ 6.282). If
degi is multiplied by 360 /6.282 then we get the angle αi.
Christina now sorts the requests according to increasing αi-values. She gets the
request sequence shown in columns 1 and 2 in Table 14.6. She saves this sequence in
the list SEQ, so that SEQ[1] ¼ H6, SEQ[2] ¼ H11, SEQ[3] ¼ H10, SEQ[4] ¼ H14,
SEQ[5] ¼ H7, SEQ[6] ¼ H1, SEQ[7] ¼ H8, SEQ[8] ¼ H12, SEQ[9] ¼ H2, SEQ

The aforementioned pseudocode depicts the modiﬁed construction procedure that
now incorporates the determined sequence of requests ordered by increasing angle
αi. This procedure appends requests in the sequence SEQ to a vehicle as long as this
vehicle has enough capacity. When vehicle capacity is not sufﬁcient to serve the next
request according to the SEQ-order, it continues with the next vehicle. If we ﬁx the
lower corner of the vertical grey line at the depot at (75; 75) and if we move the other
corner counterclockwise around the depot then the grey line “sweeps” consecutively
over all locations in the sequence SEQ. For this reason, the procedure represented in
the pseudocode is called the “sweep algorithm for the capacitated vehicle routing
problem” (Gillett and Miller 1974).
Christina applies the sweep algorithm to the AAT example and gets the route
collection printed in Table 14.7. She adds up the travel distances of the three generated
routes and ﬁnds out that they add up thus: 239.45 km + 209.02 km + 172.42 km ¼ 620.90.
Compared to the travel distance sum achieved from the application of the construction
procedure shown in Fig. 14.12, which was 873.07 km, Christina calculates a travel
distance saving of 29% as a consequence of the variation of the sequence in which the
request locations are appended to the existing routes. She learns that a careful analysis of
the locations to be inserted next at the end of a tentative route signiﬁcantly contributes to
saving travel distances. The resulting vehicle routes are plotted in Fig. 14.13.
The number of vehicles required is also reduced if the sweep procedure is applied.
However, Christina concludes that this is an achievement that has not been
addressed by the sweep procedure. Her analysis of the sweep procedure reveals
that the reduction is not addressed here. However, Christina realizes that a reduction
in the number of vehicles used has the potential to contribute to the reduction of the
total sum of travelled distances. Her statement is mainly inspired by the following
observation. If there are two vehicles following two routes, then each vehicle must
travel to the ﬁrst customer in its route and each vehicle has to travel back from the
last visited customer location to the depot. We have two outbound route segments
from the depot with length d1 (to node p) and d2 (to node q) and the inbound travel
distances from the nodes s and t to the depot of length d3 and d4. If both routes are
integrated, then we can save one outbound segment (say of the second vehicle) and
one inbound segment which summarize to d2 + d4. If this sum is larger than the

d2 + d4  d(s, p) > 0, then the combination of the two trips realizes travel distance
reductions. Clarke and Wright (1964) have proposed a so-called saving algorithm
that starts with pendulum routes between the depot and a single customer location
and continues to combine two routes to save travel distances. Further details on ADT
scenario can be found in the example in the E-Supplement.

Machine Scheduling

Christina wants to thank her study colleague (his name is Mark) for providing all the
information about the TSP that enabled her to understand the algorithmic ideas and
improve the operations at RSBT. She calls him one evening and they talk for a long
time about their current professional involvement. Mark mentions that he is working
on scheduling problems, but in the manufacturing business where he is responsible
for setting up machine schedules. Christina is interested and invites him to talk about
his experiences.

14.5.1 The Problem of Scheduling a Machine
Mark explains the general setup of a simple one-machine scheduling challenge in a
manufacturing environment (Fig. 14.14).
There is a machine that is able to process one manufacturing task at a time. A
manufacturing task is part of a customer order. All received orders are collected in
the order or job backlog. At a speciﬁc time, all jobs are prepared for fulﬁlment.
Fulﬁlling a job means using the machine to execute the manufacturing tasks
requested by the customer that is associated with a job.
All jobs from the job backlog are ordered and jobs from the backlog are
consecutively processed by the machine in the order determined by the job sequence
o1, o2, . . ., oN. The executed tasks create the assets A1, A2, . . ., AN requested by the
customers. The basic decision problem associated with the outlined machine scheduling scenario is to determine the job processing sequence that determines the
schedule of the machine.
Christina wants to know how a manufacturing request can be evaluated in order
to ﬁnd an appropriate job processing sequence. Mark explains that each individual
job is associated with different attributes. According to these attributes, jobs can be
compared and prioritized. Thonemann (2010) proposed the following three
attributes to compare jobs in a job backlog. First, the due date di of job i is used.
The due date determines the latest permitted completion time associated with a job.
Second, each job has a speciﬁc processing or ﬂow time pi, which is the time needed
to process job i on the machine. Third, the release time ti of job i is used to
characterize a job. The release time is the time at which the job is completely
speciﬁed so that its processing can start.
Christina interrupts Mark and tells him that she would have been faced with a
similar situation if she had handled the TSP. She had experienced that ﬁnding good

sequences was a very challenging task due to the strong increase in possible
permutations of operations. Furthermore, she wants to know about the planning
objectives in machine scheduling. Mark continues and states that there are several
commonly used performance indicators:
The completion time of job i determines the time when the job is completely
fulﬁlled, i.e. it is the time when the job “leaves” the machine. The completion time is
typically denoted by ci.
The ﬂow (lead-time) time fi of job i is the difference between the completion time
ci and the release time ri of a job i. It can be interpreted as the time span necessary to
respond to a customer job release.
Lateness or tardiness TDi of job i measures the amount of time in excess of the
due date associated with a job i.
Work-in-process inventory and capacity utilization.
Lead time is composed of processing time, set-up time, waiting time, lying time,
and transportation time (Fig. 14.15).
Set-up time is needed to prepare the machine for processing the next job. Lying
time is needed because of technological restrictions (e.g., drying). Transportation
time reﬂects the physical movement of jobs through the machines. Waiting time
exists because a job cannot be processed at the next machine since this machine is
occupied with another job. Even the waiting time and sometimes the set-up time can
be affected by sequencing.
Completion times, ﬂow times, and tardiness are performance indicators for
quantifying scheduling decisions from the perspective of an individual request. In
order to evaluate the quality of a complete job processing sequence, additional
performance indicators are used.
The makespan MS(S) associated with a job processing sequence S is deﬁned as
the length of the period that starts with the release of the ﬁrst job and ends with the
completion of the last job in the sequence S.

14.5

Machine Scheduling

441

Fig. 14.15 Lead time

The average completion time ACT(S) associated with sequence S is the average
value of the completion times of the processed jobs if the jobs are processed in the
sequence S by the machine.
The maximal completion time MCT(S) is the maximal value observed among all
completion times after the application of the job processing sequence S.
Mark concludes his short introduction to machine scheduling with the remark that
all the performance indicators can be used as primary planning goals. This creates
trade-offs or goal conﬂicts since some of the goals contradict each other.
A typical trade-off in production scheduling is lead time and capacity utilization.
Just imagine that you are in a supermarket on a Tuesday morning. Probably, you are
the only person there at this time. So you will not have to wait anywhere and will exit
the supermarket in a short time. The time of your shopping will be short. But what
about the supermarket? If you are the only customer, their capacity utilization is very
low. The same effect can be encountered in manufacturing and service systems in
regard to customer order lead time and resource capacity utilization.
This typical trade-off in scheduling is called the scheduling dilemma. According
to the scheduling dilemma, we cannot achieve a reduction in lead time and an
increase in capacity utilization at the same time. Mark gives an example. Students
at the Berlin School of Economics and Law arrive at the subway station Berliner
Strasse, which is about a 10 min walk from the university. They can also use bus
104 to get to the school from the subway station. Assume that the buses run every
10 min and every minute one student comes to the bus stop. In this case, the waiting
times and the lead times will be quite long, but the bus will take ten students and
have good capacity utilization. Should the buses run every minute, the lead times
would be very short (no waiting time), but the capacity utilization of each bus would
be low.

14.5.2 Priority Rule-Based Scheduling
After she has learned that the schedule generation is also based on the sequencing of
operations, as is the visit sequencing in the TSP, Christina wants to know how
appropriate job processing sequences are determined. She asks Mark whether he also
uses “greedy” strategies to add operation by operation to a partial sequence. Mark
conﬁrms her speculation, but tells Christina that there are some sort of priority or
dispatching rules whose applications make the sequencing straightforward.

442

14

Routing and Scheduling

Mark explains that a priority rule is a “rule of thumb” to sort a set of jobs
according to increasing or decreasing values of the release times ri, the ﬂow times
fi, or the due dates di. The application of such a “simple” rule seems to be promising
since the evaluation value of an individual job is not affected by the earlier or the
subsequently processed job. This is a major difference from sequencing in the TSP
when the travel distances between consecutively visited nodes impacts the overall
objective which is the total sum of travelled distances. Priority rules can be applied
both for job shop and ﬂow shop (cf. Chap. 9).
Task 14.3 Scheduling by Priority Rules
In order to demonstrate the effects of determining a job processing sequence using a
priority rule, Mark introduces an example with eight jobs. The attributes of the jobs
from the job backlog are summarized in Table 14.8.
The most intuitive approach for the determination of the job processing sequence
is to process the jobs in the sequence of their arrival or release time. Those jobs
arriving ﬁrst will be processed ﬁrst. This sequencing rule is called First Come/First
Serve (FCFS). It does not apply to any “intelligent” sorting, but it is a fair approach.
Table 14.9 shows the machine schedule resulting from the FCFS-processing job.
The makespan is 44–1 ¼ 43 time units. The average completion time equals 27 time
units, but the maximal completion time is 44 time units. Five jobs are completed with
delays. The average tardiness is 6.75 time units and the maximal tardiness is 23 time
units. On average, the ﬂow time is 22.5 time units.
The application of FCFS does not consider processing times or due dates while
determining the sequence of processing. In order to enable a quick delivery of jobs, it
is useful to try to minimize the completion times of jobs. Here, it is beneﬁcial to
process those jobs ﬁrst that can be processed rapidly in order to make the machine
available for the next job as quickly as possible. According to the ShortestProcessing-Time rule (SPT-rule) the jobs are sorted by increasing processing time.
The job with the shortest processing time in the job backlog is processed ﬁrst.
The SPT-generated job processing sequence is listed in column 1 of Table 14.10.
Again, the makespan is 43 time units, but the average completion time is reduced
from 27 time units to 23.25 time units. The maximal completion time remains
44 time units. Four jobs are still delayed with a slightly reduced tardiness of
6 time units. However, the maximal tardiness is prolonged to 26 time units, but
the average ﬂow time is reduced to 18.75 time units.
Neither the application of the SPT rule nor the application of FCFS is able to
control the maximal tardiness since neither of these two rules considers the due date
information associated with the jobs. In order to minimize the maximal tardiness, the
Earliest Due Date rule (EDD-rule) is proposed. According to the EDD-rule, the

most urgent job is processed ﬁrst, followed by the job with the second highest
urgency.
The makespan remains 43 time units (since there is no slack time in the schedules)
as shown in Table 14.11. The average completion time is 29.5 time units and the
maximal completion time equals 44 time units. An average ﬂow time of 25 time
units is observed. The application of the EDD-rule leads to a signiﬁcant reduction in
maximal tardiness from 23 (FCFS) and 26 (EDD), respectively, down to 13 time
units. Unfortunately, the number of delayed requests is increased (six jobs). The
same development is observed for the average tardiness, which is increased by to
7 time units compared to 6 time units (SPT) and 6.75 time units (FCFS).
"

Practical Insights The application of a priority rule enables the minimization of a single performance indicator value. There is no priority rule
known that minimizes all three performance indicators (1) number of
delayed requests (2) average completion time and (3) maximal delay.
However, priority rules are easy to apply. This is why these simple
heuristics are widely used in practice. In sophisticated scheduling software, so-called meta-heuristics such as genetic algorithms and ant colony
optimization (ACO) are used. They provide solutions of very high quality.

14.5.3 Scheduling Algorithm of Moore
Moore (1968) published a paper about a one-machine scheduling algorithm that
minimizes the number of delayed jobs. The basic idea is to extend the EDD rule by
identifying those jobs that block the machine. Those jobs are then moved to the end
of the sequence with the hope that now one or even more jobs can be started earlier
so that the number of delayed jobs can be reduced. Mark is going to explain to
Christina how the Moore algorithm works by means of the example previously
introduced.
First, the job backlog is scheduled according to the EDD rule. If there are no
delayed jobs, then the schedule construction is ﬁnished. Otherwise, the ﬁrst delayed
job according to the EDD-induced schedule is marked; here job 7 is the ﬁrst delayed
job (Table 14.12).
The basic idea of the Moore algorithm is to ﬁnd out the cause of this delay. Moore
supposed that the marked or a previously processed job is responsible for the delay.
To this end, Moore suggested moving the labelled job 7 or one of the previously
scheduled jobs (job 1 or job 3) to the end of the sequence so that all subsequent jobs
can be started earlier. In order to identify the most appropriate job to be moved to the
end, Moore proposed comparing the processing times pi of the marked job and of the
earlier scheduled jobs and selecting the job among the aforementioned jobs with the
longest processing time in order to achieve a maximal left shift of the job starting
times. In the example (Table 14.12), job 7 exhibits the longest processing time
p7 ¼ 8 so that it is moved to the end of the sequence. This job is marked by * in
Table 14.13.
In the next iteration, the ﬁrst delayed job (job 4) is marked. This job and job
5 have the same maximal processing time of 7 time units among all requests started
after the marked job. Job 5 is selected (since it appears ﬁrst in the intermediate
sequence) and job 5 is moved to the end of the sequence (Table 14.14).
Table 14.14 contains the ﬁnal scheduling sequence (1; 3; 6; 4; 2; 8; 7; 5). None of
the so far unmoved jobs is delayed so that the algorithm terminates. The minimal
number of delayed jobs is two.

14.5.4 Scheduling Two Machines in a Flow Shop
Christina detects similarities between the machine scheduling problem outlined by
Mark and the TSP. There are the jobs which correspond to the requests in the TSP
and there are resources: in the TSP there is a vehicle, but in Mark’s setup there is a

manufacturing machine. Christina wonders if there is a machine scheduling setup
with two or even more machines that corresponds to the CVRP (Fig. 14.16).
She asks Mark about this question. Mark afﬁrms, but tells Christina that there are
several multi-machine setups. Christina wants to know what the schedule generation
is like in such a multi-machine scenario. Mark starts with a description of the system
setup (Fig. 14.16). Each job requires two production steps. In the ﬁrst step, the work
piece is painted and in the second step the painted piece is protected by a coating. Of
course, it is necessary that painting precedes coating for all jobs. Each job i is
characterized by the two processing times pipaint for the painting procedure as well
as picoat for the coating procedure (Table 14.15).
Mark explains that there is a famous approach to this setting for minimizing the
completion time of the complete job backlog. This algorithm was originally proposed by Johnson (1954) and is hence called Johnson’s algorithm. This algorithm
follows the principle of keeping the idle times of the second machine as short as
possible. This is achieved by starting those jobs ﬁrst on the ﬁrst machine with the
shortest pipaint-values. These jobs are quickly processed by the ﬁrst machine and then
forwarded to the second machine in order to avoid idle times on the last mentioned
machine. The starting sequences of the jobs on the two machines should be kept
unchanged. Therefore, it is sufﬁcient to deﬁne the job processing sequence only for
the ﬁrst machine. The determined sequence then also applies for the second machine.
The Johnson’s algorithm starts by splitting up the job backlog into two subsets J1
and J2. All jobs i whose processing times pipaint are shorter than their processing
times picoat are put into J1. The remaining jobs are collected in the set J2. In the
example setting, the ﬁrst set is J1:¼ {1; 2; 5; 7} and the second set is J2:¼{3; 4; 6; 8}.
In the second step, both sets are ordered. The set J1 is sorted by increasing
processing times pipaint and the set J2 is sorted by decreasing processing times picoat.
In the example, we have the sequence S1:¼(2; 5; 7; 1) as well as the sequence S2:¼(4;
6; 8; 3).

In the third step, sequence S1 is combined with sequence S2 by appending S2 to
S1. In the example, we get the complete job backlog sequence S:¼(S1, S2) ¼ (2; 5; 7;
1; 4; 6; 8; 3).
Mark outlines the generated schedule in a Gantt-chart (i.e., a special form of
schedule representation) and compares it with the schedule that results from starting
the jobs in the order in which they have been released (Fig. 14.17). It can be observed
that makespan has been reduced with the help of Johnson’s algorithm.

14.5.5 Further Challenges in Machine Scheduling
In reality, there is a variety of other more complicated machine scheduling situations
(Kovalyov et al. 2007; Dolgui et al. 2010; Berrichi and Yalaoui 2013). Li and Chen
(2010) investigated a one-machine set-up in which the exact processing times of the
jobs in the backlog are unknown, but estimated by a distribution function. Albers
(1997) analyzed a setup in which the job backlog is not available. Instead, no
arriving job is scheduled before it arrives or without considering a job arriving
subsequently.

448

14

Routing and Scheduling

If two or more machines must be scheduled in order to fulﬁl a set of jobs, two
general setups are distinguished. The case outlined by Mark falls into the category of
ﬂow production (Dolgui and Proth 2010; Pinedo 2010): all jobs are processed in the
same sequence on all available machines. In the job shop setup (Mattfeld 1996;
Werner 2013), each job maintains an individual machine processing sequence. In
many industries, ﬂexible ﬂow and job shops with alternative parallel machines are
used (Kyparisis and Koulamas 2006; Ivanov and Sokolov 2012). In the process
industry, continuous ﬂows represent an additional challenge (Shah 2004; Bożek and
Wysocki 2015; Ivanov et al. 2016a).
Next, SC coordination belongs to future trends in scheduling research and
practice. In this area, integration of scheduling and routing problems is studied
(Agnetis et al. 2006; Chen 2010). In addition, integration of inventory-routing
decisions as well as supplier selection and scheduling is a promising research area
(Sawik 2013).
Finally, uncertainty challenges scheduling and routing decisions. In this setting,
the issues of schedule stability and robustness along with the development of
rescheduling policies has become more and more important (Kolisch and Hess
2000; Vieira et al. 2003; Artigues et al. 2005; Aytug et al. 2005; van de Vonder
et al. 2007; Hazir et al. 2010; Gomes et al. 2013; Sotskov et al. 2013; Harjunkoski
et al. 2014; Liu and Ro 2014).

14.6

Key Points

In this chapter, you have been introduced to typical operative process planning tasks
from transportation as well as production. In particular, you are now familiar with
the shortest path problem, the travelling salesman problem, the CVRP, with the
single machine scheduling problem, and a simple two-machine ﬂow-shop problem.
You have learned the basics about the formulation of decision models on mathematical graphs and you are now familiar with the concept of modeling operative
decision tasks as graph-based optimization models. Decision variables are used to
represent atomic decision tasks and constraints must be considered in order to
compile a feasible solution for a complex decision problem from the atomic
decisions.
You are aware now that a careful selection of adequate algorithms for solving
optimization models deﬁned on graphs is important. For some decision problems,
such models as the one presented for the shortest path problem, there are exact
algorithms. As an example, you have been introduced to the Dijkstra algorithm.
Christina leans back and recapitulates on what she has learned. First, a networkbased optimization model for TSP was introduced. This model falls into the category
of a mixed-integer linear problem since some decision variables must be integers or
even binary. Within such a model, it is possible to add constraints to control the
decision variable value determination.
Compared to the shortest path problem in a network, which does not have any
constraints about nodes to be visited, the complexity of the TSP is signiﬁcantly

14.6

Key Points

increased. Therefore, it is reasonable to refrain from using exact algorithms for the
identiﬁcation of the best possible Hamiltonian path (with the least travel distance).
Instead heuristics are proposed to approximate an optimal Hamiltonian path. There
are different types of heuristics. Construction heuristics are used to set up an initial
feasible solution for a constraint optimization model. Improvement heuristics (e.g. a
2-opt improvement procedure) are used to improve the objective function value of
the best found feasible solution, i.e. to replace an existing feasible solution with
another feasible solution having an improved objective function value). Christina is
happy since she can use the proposed techniques to model and solve RSBT’s SST
challenge.
Section 14.4 introduced the decision problem class of combined assignment and
sequencing problems from operation ﬂeet management. The basic decision task is
described in the CVRP. We started the discussion of the CVRP with an outline of a
typical planning situation. By means of this example, we discussed the sophisticated
decision challenges of a simultaneously conducted partition of the set of requested
locations, and the sequencing of the locations in order to determine vehicle routes.
We have seen that failures in the assignment of requests to vehicles typically result in
detours and an increase in the number of required vehicles. Both issues contribute to
additional costs for fulﬁlling customer requests.
In order to contribute to keeping the fulﬁlment costs as low as possible, we
proposed analysis of customer locations, i.e. the locations that require a visit. For this
reason, we proposed sorting all locations by means of their angle relative to a
reference line. We then proposed the sweep algorithm, which exploits information
about the vicinity of different locations. The sweep algorithm tries to compile closely
situated locations into one route in order to keep the sum of travelled distances low.
We are now prepared to manage all decision situations that are in the form of the
AAT challenge.
Finally, we have learned how to design simple heuristics for complex routing and
scheduling models. But you are also aware that the computation of (sub)-optimal
model solutions is often very complicated. Nevertheless, you understand the importance of formulating an appropriate decision model as the interface between
applications and computers. The formulation is the most important ingredient for
the setup of computerized decision support systems.
Toth and Vigo (2002) discussed model formulations for the CVRP. These models
are used to apply special solver tools like CPLEX or LINGO in order to derive
proven optimal solutions to the CVRP. However, depending on the actual data of a
CVRP scenario and depending on the number of available vehicles and requests to
be served, the processing times are often prohibitive so that for practical real-world
problem settings heuristics are applied preferentially (Gendreau et al. 2002).
For other decision models, it is necessary to incorporate heuristics like the greedy
heuristic or the sweep heuristic. There are also priority rules that can be applied to
sequence tasks in machine scheduling. You can distinguish between construction
and improvement procedures as basic ingredients of heuristic algorithms for solving
complex models with several constraints. Fleet routing and machine scheduling
belong to the most exciting tasks in SCOM!

Introductory Case-Study: Capacity Disruption at BASF

On October 17, 2016 as a result of an incorrect maintenance operation on a pipeline
at BASF facility in Ludwigshafen (Germany), there was an explosion and
subsequent ﬁres at North Harbor, a terminal for the supply of raw materials such
as naphtha, methanol and compressed liqueﬁed gases. More than 2.6 million tons of
goods are handled there each year and an average of seven ships a day moor at its
docks. Two steam crackers, the starting point for producing basic chemicals, needed
to be stopped because they could no longer be supplied, and 22 were only partially
working. The two steam crackers could have been restarted 2 days later, but only in
May 2017 was the concept for reconstruction released whereby the reconstruction

should be completed by September 2017. Restricted production output, a daily
revenue decrease of 10–15% as compared to the previous year during the disruption
period, impact on the basic chemicals division (about 21% of sales), delivery delays,
limited access to key raw materials, exhausted product inventories, and a forecasted
impact on 6% of BASF’s annual earnings were some of the consequences of this
incident (Dolgui et al. 2018, and references within). Logistics was temporarily
shifted from ships and pipelines to trucks and trains. BASF was in close contact
with its customers to keep them informed about the current availability of products to
minimize the impact on customer deliveries. Because of BASF integrated
“Verbundsystem” (networking system), comprised of various plants and delivery
systems for feedstocks, the incident had an impact along the global supply chain
(SC). This high and long-term impact is the so-called ripple effect (Ivanov et al.
2014a, b).
BASF built a resilient SC, which is why the economic consequences of the aforementioned incident were considerably smaller than expected. BASF took process
safety and risk prevention measures that included globally valid guidelines and
requirements for buildings etc. and practical security trainings for employees and
support staff. Along with process safety and risk prevention measures, BASF has
global emergency response management. This management consists of the integration of worldwide group companies, joint ventures, partners, suppliers and
customers. Emergency phones and an integrated network of control centres
(e.g. internal/external ﬁre departments and rescue service) also enable this global
emergency response management to work even more closely together. BASF was
prepared for the incident in October 2016, but there is still long-term impact.

15.2

Uncertainty and Risks

Uncertainty is a system property characterizing the incompleteness of our knowledge about the system and the conditions of its development. The concept of risk is
subject to various deﬁnitions. Knight (1921) classiﬁed under ‘risk’ the ‘measurable’
uncertainty. From the ﬁnancial perspective of Markowitz (1952), risk is the variance
of return. From a project management perspective, risk is a measure of the probability and consequence of not achieving a deﬁned project goal. According to March and
Shapira (1987), risk is a product of the probability of occurrence of a negative event
and the resulting amount of damage.
Generally, in decision theory, risk is a measure of the set of possible (negative)
outcomes from a single rational decision and their probabilistic values. In the
literature on supply chain management, the term “risk” is also replaced with “vulnerability”, which means “at risk”.
In analysing uncertainty and risks, four aspects are usually encountered. The ﬁrst
is uncertainty itself, the second is risks, the third is perturbation inﬂuence
(disturbances), and the last is the perturbation impact inﬂuences (deviations). In

Uncertainty and Risks

Sokolov 2010 and Ivanov 2018)

the further course of this and the following chapters, we will frequently encounter
this constellation (see Fig. 15.1).
Uncertainty is the general property of a system environment that exists independent of us for any system of a sensible complexity degree. As shown in Fig. 15.1, we
can broaden and narrow the uncertainty space.
Risk arises from uncertainty. Risks can be identiﬁed, analysed, controlled and
regulated. We consciously talked about uncertainty factors and the appearance of
risks such as the risk of demand ﬂuctuation as a result of the environmental
uncertainty.
A disturbance (perturbation impact) is the consequence of risks. It may be
purposeful (i.e. thefts) and non-purposeful (i.e. demand ﬂuctuations or the occurrence of some events that may necessitate adapting the supply chain). It may cause a
deviation (disruption) in the supply chain or not (e.g. a supply chain can be robust
and adaptive enough to overcome the disturbance).
Operational deviations (or severe disruptions) are the result of perturbation
inﬂuences. They may affect operations, processes, plans, goals or strategies. To
adjust the supply chain in the case of deviations, adaptation measures need to be
taken.
For the supply chain management domain, uncertainty factors and measures for
their handling can be distinguished as follows (see Table 15.1).
In Table 15.2, some examples of disturbances and disruptions in supply chains in
recent years are presented.
Complexity management and system modelling can be considered as a theoretical
basis for handling uncertainty in supply chains. From the perspective of complexity

management, the problem of a system under control and uncertainty is related to an
area under control and an area under uncertainty. This idea is based on Ashby’s
principle (Ashby 1956) of requisite variety (Fig. 15.2).
By broadening the control area (Fig. 15.2b) and narrowing the uncertainty area or
reverse (Fig. 15.2a), the system control can be adapted. Hence, the mutual relations
between the system and environment spaces fall into the categories of ampliﬁcation
of a control variety and attenuation of an environmental variety (see Fig. 15.2).
Thus, amplifying the variety of our control area and reducing the area of uncertainty,
(1) a balance of control and perturbed impacts as well as (2) the maintenance of the
planned execution processes and a quick cost-efﬁcient process recovery once disturbed can be reached.

15.3

Risk Management in the Supply Chain

15.3.1 Risk Classification
Risk management in the supply chain became one of the most important topics in
research and practice over the last decade. A number of books (Handﬁeld and
McCormack 2008; Kouvelis et al. 2012; Waters 2011; Gurnani et al. 2012;
Heckmann 2016; Mistree et al. 2017; Khojasteh 2017; Ivanov 2018) and literature
review papers (Blackhurst et al. 2005; Wagner and Bode 2008; Klibi et al. 2010;
Simangunsong et al. 2012; Ho et al. 2015; Fahimnia et al. 2015; Gupta et al. 2016;
Dolgui et al. 2018) provide insightful overviews and introductions to different
aspects of this exciting ﬁeld.
Recent literature introduced different classiﬁcations of supply chain risks (Chopra
and Sodhi 2004; Tang and Musa 2011; Ho et al. 2015; Quang and Hara 2017). For

Quang and Hara (2017) classify the following seven groups of risks:
• External risks which “deal with threats from an external perspective of SC that
can be caused by economical, sociopolitical or geographical reasons. Examples
are ﬁre accidents, natural catastrophes, economic downturn, external legal issues,
corruption, and cultural differentiation”,
• Time risks referring to delays in SC processes
• Information risks, e.g., communication breakdown within the project team,
information infrastructure complications, distorted information and information
leaks
• Financial risks, e.g., inﬂation, interest rate level, currency ﬂuctuations and
stakeholder requests
• Supply risks, i.e., risks related to suppliers, e.g. supplier bankruptcy, price
ﬂuctuations, unstable quality and quantity of inputs
• Operational risks, caused by problems within the organisational boundaries of a
ﬁrm, e.g. changes in design and technology, accidents and labour disputes
• Demand risks that refers to demand variability, high market competition, customer bankruptcy and customer fragmentation

15.3.2 General Framework of Risk Management in the Supply Chain
Risk management is a methodological approach to managing uncertainty outcome. A
particular feature of risk management in supply chains (unlike in technical systems)
is that people do not strive for a 100% guarantee of the result: they consciously tend
to take risks. There is a contradiction between objective risks, those determined by
experts applying quantitative scientiﬁc means and perceived risk, those which
include managers’ perceptions.

15.3

Risk Management in the Supply Chain

461

Actually, the objective risk treatment is rooted in technical science where 100%
reliability is mandatory. In socio-economic systems, like supply chains, a value of
95% as an orientation for supply chains is empirically suggested (e.g. Shefﬁ 2005).
Different managers perceive risk to different extents, and these perceptions can
change in the same manager due to changes in his environment. That is why the
models for supply chains should not strive for a unique optimal solution but allow
the formation of a number of alternative solutions with different degrees of potential
economic performance and risk. Summarizing, we will note that risk can be considered from three basic positions:
1. risk is a likelihood estimation of a negative outcome of the event leading to
losses/losses (the technological approach);
2. risk is an individual estimation by the person of the danger of a negative outcome
of the event leading to losses/losses; risk is ultimately a property of any entrepreneurship (the psychological approach);
3. risk is an integral property of any process or system, the management of which is
a key problem in economic performance and stability maintenance (the organizational approach).
Let us describe the concept of risk management in the supply chain. In order to
analyse risks, the following main categories are introduced: the risk factor, the risk
source, the risk situation, and the dangerous situation. The risk factor is a global
category that characterizes a system at the goal-orientation level (e.g. upsetting of the
production plan, delivery breakdown, etc.). Risk sources consider certain events that
may cause risk factors. The dangerous situation characterizes the state of a system
when a probability of risk sources’ appearance and their direct inﬂuence on this
system is high. The risk situation means a condition when the active inﬂuences of
risk sources cause disturbances and deviations in system functioning (see Fig. 15.3).
The problem of supply chain functioning in terms of risk consists of the following
main phases: risk factors’ identiﬁcation ! risk sources and dangerous situations’
identiﬁcation ! identiﬁcation of interdependences between risk situation appearance and changes of system functioning parameters ! decision-making about
compromise while supply chain conﬁguration by aggravation of some goal criteria
(e.g. cost increase while keeping the planned production volume and deadline;
production volume reduction while keeping the same cost level and deadline; change
of deadline while keeping the same costs and production volume, etc.) ! control
decision development in order to compensate for possible disturbances in system
functioning caused by risk situations ! development of a managed object monitoring system.
In summarizing the practical advancements in uncertainty handling within a
supply chain environment, the following can be concluded:
1. Uncertainty space may be reduced by means of, e.g.:

462

• introducing excessiveness in supply chain structures (e.g. time buffers, safety
stocks, additional resources, capacity reserves, etc.);
• improving coordination and information ﬂows to make better quality, timeliness, and accessibility;
• introducing supply chain monitoring and event management systems to react
quickly to disturbances and disruptions; and
• forming a set of not ﬁnal decisions, i.e. postponement and rolling/adaptive
planning.
2. It is impossible to avoid uncertainty.

15.4

Operational and Disruption Risks

Klibi et al. (2010) classify uncertainties and risks in the supply chain as follows:
• random uncertainty (demand ﬂuctuation risks)
• hazard uncertainty (risk of unusual events with high impact)
• deep uncertainty (severe disruption risks)
The different types of risks in the supply chain can be classiﬁed into demand,
supply, process, and structure areas (see Fig. 15.4).

15.4

Operational and Disruption Risks

463

Risks of demand and supply uncertainty are related to random uncertainty and
business-as-usual situation. Such risks are also known as recurrent or operational
risks. Supply chain managers achieved signiﬁcant improvements at managing global
supply chains and mitigating recurrent supply chain risks through improved
planning and execution (Chopra and Sodhi 2014).
Disruption risks represent a new challenge for supply chain managers. From 2000
thru 2017, supply chain disruptions (e.g., because of both natural and man-made
disasters, such as on 11 March 2011 in Japan, ﬂoods in Thailand in 2011, ﬁre in the
Phillips Semiconductor plant in New Mexico, etc.) occurred in greater frequency and
intensity, and thus with greater consequences (Chopra and Sodhi 2014; Simchi-Levi
et al. 2014). Hendricks and Singhal (2005) quantiﬁed the negative effects of supply
chain disruption through empirical analysis and found 33–40% lower stock returns
relative to their benchmarks over a 3-year time period that started 1 year before and
ended 2 years after a disruption.
Disruption risks represent a new challenge for supply chain managers who face
the ripple effect (Ivanov et al. 2014a, b, 2017; Ivanov 2017; Dolgui et al. 2018)
subject to structural disruptions in the supply chain, unlike the parametrical
deviations in the bullwhip effect (Fig. 15.5).
In the last two decades, considerable advancements have been achieved in
research regarding the mitigation of inventory and production shortages and
response to demand ﬂuctuations. In particular, the bullwhip-effect in the supply
chain has been extensively considered in this domain subject to randomness uncertainty with the help of stochastic and simulation models.

Supply Chain Risk Management and Resilience

Fig. 15.5 Operational and disruption risks in supply chains

The differences between the bullwhip effect and ripple effect are presented in
Table 15.3.
The Bullwhip effect considers weekly/daily demand and lead-time ﬂuctuations as
primary drivers of the changes in the supply chain which occur at the parametric
level and can be eliminated in a short-term perspective. In recent years, the research
community has started to investigate severe supply chain disruptions with long-term
impacts that can be caused, for example, by natural disasters, political conﬂicts,
terrorism, maritime piracy, economic crises, destroying of information systems, or
transport infrastructure failures. We refer to these severe natural and man-made
disasters as the ripple effect in the supply chain where changes in the supply chain
occur at the structural level and recovery may take mid- and long-term periods of
time with signiﬁcant impact on output performance such as annual revenues. In this
setting, supply chain disruption management can be considered a critical capability
which helps to create cost-efﬁcient supply chain protection and implement appropriate actions to recover supply chain disruptions and performance.
Most studies on supply chain disruption consider how changes to some variables
are rippling through the rest of the supply chain and impacting performance. Studies
by Ivanov et al. (2014a, b) and Dolgui et al. (2018) suggest considering this situation
as the ripple effect in the supply chain, as an analogy to computer science, where the
ripple effect determines the disruption-based scope of changes in the system.

15.5

Ripple Effect in the Supply Chain

The ripple effect in the supply chain occurs if a disruption cannot be localized and
cascades downstream impacting supply chain performance such as sales, stock
return, service level, and costs (Ivanov et al. 2014a; Dolgui et al. 2018; Ivanov
2018; Pavlov et al. 2018). The methodical elaborations on the evaluation and

understanding of low-frequency-high-impact disruptions are therefore vital for
understanding and further development of network-based supply concepts (Tomlin
2006; Liberatore et al. 2012; Sawik 2016).
Details of empirical or quantitative methodologies differ across the works on
supply chain disruption management, but most share a basic set of attributes:
• a disruption (or a set of disruptions)
• impact of the disruption on operational and strategic economic performance
• stabilization and recovery policies.
Within this set of attributes, most studies on supply chain disruption consider how
changes to some variables are rippling through the rest of the supply chain and
impacting performance. We suggest considering this situation, the ripple effect in the
supply chain, as an analogy to computer science, where the ripple effect determines
the disruption-based scope of changes in the system.
The ripple effect is a phenomenon of disruption propagations in the supply chain
and their impact on output supply chain performance (e.g., sales, on-time delivery,
and total proﬁt). It may have more serious consequences than just short-term
performance decrease. It can result in market share losses (e.g., Toyota lost its
market leader position after tsunami in 2011 and needed to redesign supply chain
coordination mechanism). The ripple effect is also known as “domino effect” or
“snowball effect”. The reasons for ripple effect are not difﬁcult to ﬁnd. With
increasing supply chain complexity and consequent pressure on speed and efﬁciency, an ever-increasing number of industries come to be distributed worldwide
and concentrated in industrial districts. In addition, globalized supply chains depend
heavily on permanent transportation infrastructure availability.

466

15

Supply Chain Risk Management and Resilience

The ripple effect describes disruption propagation in the supply chain, impact of
a disruption on supply chain performance and disruption-based scope of changes in
supply chain structures and parameters.
Following a disruption, its effect ripples through the supply chain. The missing
capacities or inventory at the disrupted facility may cause missing materials and
production decrease at the next stages in the supply chain. Should the supply chain
remain in the disruption model longer than some critical period of time [i.e., time-tosurvive (Simchi-Levi et al. 2015)], critical performance indicators such as sales or
stock returns may be affected.
The scope of the rippling and its impact on economic performance depends both
on robustness reserves (e.g., redundancies like inventory or capacity buffers) and
speed and scale of recovery measures. Therefore, the risks and supply chain resilience should be estimated at the design and planning stages in the proactive mode.
At the control stage in the reactive mode, contingency plans (e.g., alternative
suppliers or shipping routes) must happen quickly to expedite stabilization and
recovery in order to ensure continuity of supply and avoid long-term impacts. In
implementing such recovery policies, companies need a tool supported by collaboration and supply chain visibility solutions for assessing the disruption impact on the
supply chain as well as the effects and costs from redirecting material ﬂows. In
supply chain management settings, the ripple effect should also include recovery
strategies which may compensate for disruptions and avoid their rippling.
It has been extensively documented in literature that severe disruptions may
ripple quickly through global supply chains and cause losses in supply chain
performance that can be measured by such key performance indicators as revenues,
sales, service level, and total proﬁts (Schmitt and Singh 2012; Simchi-Levi et al.
2015; Snyder et al. 2016). Such risks are new challenges for research and industries
that face the ripple effect arising from vulnerability, instability, and disruptions in
supply chains (Liberatore et al. 2012; Ivanov et al. 2014a, b). As opposite to wellknown bullwhip effect that considers high-frequency-low-impact operational risks,
the ripple effect studies low-frequency-high-impact disruptive risks (Fahimnia et al.
2015; Simchi-Levi et al. 2015; Sokolov et al. 2016; Snyder et al. 2016).
Figure 15.6 summarize major reasons for the ripple effect.
Along with the identiﬁcation of the reasons for the disruption risks, risk mitigation
strategies have been developed with regards to proactive and reactive control stages
(Bode et al. 2011; Ivanov et al. 2017). Let us consider them in the next section.

15.6

Supply Chain Resilience

15.6.1 Resilience Framework
Supply chain resilience is the “ability to maintain, execute and recover (adapt)
planned execution along with achievement of the planned (or adapted, but yet still
acceptable) performance is therefore the next objective property of the supply chain”
(Ivanov 2018). Supply chain resilience is a multi-facet property that comprises a

15.6

Supply Chain Resilience

467

Fig. 15.6 Reasons for the ripple effect (Ivanov 2018)

number of components in both internal supply chain processes and in interaction
with the environment (Fig. 15.7).
One of the main objectives of supply chain management is to increase total supply
chain output performance, which is basically referred to as supply chain effectiveness (i.e., sales and service level) and efﬁciency (supply chain costs). At the same
time, achievement of planned performance can involve the impact of perturbations in
a real-time execution environment. Supply chain execution is subject to uncertainty
at the planning stage and disruption at the execution stage. Cost efﬁciency comes
with a huge hidden expense should a major disruption (i.e., a more severe impact
than a routine disturbance) occur. This requires supply chain protection against and
efﬁcient reaction to disturbances and disruptions. Therefore, supply chains need to
be planned to be stable, robust and resilient enough to (1) maintain their basic
properties and ensure execution; and (2) be able to adapt their behavior in the case of
disturbances in order to achieve planned performance using recovery actions.
In Fig. 15.8, we summarize relations of redundancy, robustness, resilience and
ﬂexibility (see also Ivanov and Sokolov 2013; Ivanov 2018).
First, different reserves (material inventory, capacities) can be referred to. Tomlin
(2006) and Chopra and Sodhi (2004) analysed the issues of risk mitigation inventory
and reserve capacity on supply chain resilience. It should be noted that risk mitigation inventory differs from classical safety stock and is considered to decouple from
disruptive risks. For this issue, valuable approaches and models for supply chain
design and planning under uncertainty were elaborated.
Second, new strategies such as leagile, agile and responsive supply chains can be
applied to make supply chains more ﬂexible in a wider sense of the word. The third
method is related to better coordination in supply chains and refers to the concepts
like collaborative planning, forecasting and replenishment. Fourth, a set of postponed decisions (product postponement, rolling/adaptive planning) can be used. All
these approaches can be referred to as supply chain redundancy.
The above-mentioned redundancies generally serve for two problem areas. First,
they are intended to protect the supply chain against perturbation impacts based on
certain reserves. This issue is related to the supply chain robustness. Second,
redundancies are created to amplify the fork variety of supply chain paths to react
quickly and ﬂexibly to changes of a real execution environment. This issue is related
to supply chain ﬂexibility.

Supply Chain Risk Management and Resilience

Fig. 15.8 Resilience control elements (Ivanov 2018)

The robustness of supply chains is a complex characteristic of a non-failure
operation, durability, recoverability, and the maintaining of supply chain processes
and a supply chain as a whole. This is connected with the creation of a reserves
system (the introduction of resource excessiveness) for the prevention of failures and
deviations in supply chain processes.
Recent literature has identiﬁed different methods to strengthen supply chains to
mitigate uncertainty impacts and ensure supply chain robustness. Different robustness reserves can include material inventory, capacities buffers, etc. For this issue,
valuable approaches and models for supply chain design and planning under uncertainty were elaborated.

15.6

Supply Chain Resilience

469

The ﬂexibility of supply chains is a property concerning its ability to change itself
quickly, structurally and functionally depending on the current execution state and
reaching supply chain management goals by a change in supply chain structures and
behaviour. This is connected with the creation of an adaptation system (with regard
to operations and resources) for the prevention, improvement, or acquisition of new
characteristics for the achievement of goals under the current environmental
conditions varying in time.
Basic areas of ﬂexibility include system, process and product ﬂexibility
(Fig. 15.9).
System ﬂexibility is composed of structural and strategy components. Companies
implement product and process ﬂexibility extensively (see e.g., new Volkswagen
production system (VPS) strategy). Coordination and sourcing strategies in supply
chains are also typical in practice. Many companies invest in structural redundancy
(e.g., Toyota extends its supply chain subject to multiple-sourcing and building new
facilities on the supply side). All these four elements of ﬂexibility can be seen as
strategies for mitigating the ripple effect at the mitigation stage and reacting at the
post-disruption stage.

15.6.2 Costs of Resilience
Increase in inventory, additional production capacities, and alternative transportation
methods or back-up facilities would increase costs. At the same time, these so-called
redundant elements would potentially lead to an increase in sales and service level.
The robustness elements would also reduce risk of perturbations which may inﬂuence schedule execution. Therefore, target objectives (e.g., on-time delivery) can be
better achieved. This will positively inﬂuence sales and service level. Redundancy
elements may also increase supply chain ﬂexibility and have positive effects on both
service level and costs. The resilient state of a supply chain requires a balanced
robustness and ﬂexibility which allows for achieving maximum service level with

Fig. 15.9 Supply chain ﬂexibility (adopted with changes from Ivanov et al. 2014b)

470

15

Supply Chain Risk Management and Resilience

disruption risk considerations at acceptable redundancy costs. These ideas are
simpliﬁed in Figs. 15.10 and 15.11.
In Fig. 15.10a, a supply chain of a retailer, a warehouse, and a factory is
presented. The factory orders 100 units of a product every day from factory that is
aligned with the daily production capacity of 100 units. No batching is considered in
this simple example. Daily shipments are assumed. The warehouse holds risk
mitigation inventory of 700 units as a proactive resilience policy. In Fig. 15.10b,
factory capacity is disrupted for 7 days. Considering the risk mitigation inventory of
700 units and daily demand of 100 units, this disruption does not affect supply chain
performance in terms of service level, i.e., the ratio of on-time delivered orders to all
placed orders.
Now let us consider Fig. 15.11.
The disruption proﬁle constituted in the work by Shefﬁ (2005) includes eight
phases: preparation actions, the disruptive event, the ﬁrst response, the initial impact,
the full impact, the recovery preparations, and the recovery and long term impact. In
Fig. 15.11, a general framework of supply chain performance and recovery analysis
is depicted. The major idea here is to observe the impact of different recovery
policies on supply chain performance. Figure 15.11b depicts that in case a factory
stops producing for 14 days, service levels will be disrupted since risk mitigation
inventory would help for 1 week only. In Fig. 15.11c, it can be observed that usage
of back-up factory mitigates the ripple effect and performance decrease. However,
both risk mitigation inventory and a back-up capacity increase supply chain costs.
It is evident that through the adaptation, supply chain ﬂexibility and robustness
are interrelated. From the dynamics point of view, the robustness elements can also
be considered as ﬂexibility elements and the ﬂexibility elements can also be considered as robustness drivers. This is quite natural since both robustness and ﬂexibility
serve as “uncertainty cushions” of a supply chain. Balancing the elements of
ﬂexibility and robustness at proactive and reactive control loops, different
constellations of service level, costs and stability can be analyzed methodically
and well-founded and with regard to a risk covering strategy and supply chain
management strategy (Fig. 15.12).
Figure 15.12 depicts an example of a typical multi-objective analysis with regards
to different proactive and reactive policies. We are interested in investigating the
impacts of different combinations of disruptions (i.e., two scenarios in Fig. 15.12),
proactive mitigation strategies and reactive recovery policies (A, B, C, and D) on the
supply chain performance in form of service level and costs. The combinations of
proactive mitigation strategies and reactive recovery policies (e.g., A—higher risk
mitigation inventory, B—a back-up facility, etc.) may differ in costs and service
level impacts for different disruption scenarios. The task of quantitative analysis
methods is to decide on what proactive and reactive policies need to be selected.
The study by Ivanov and Dolgui (2018) suggested a new approach to supply
chain disruption risk management where SC behavior is less dependent on the
certainty of our knowledge about the environment and its changes. The unpredictability of the occurrence of disruption and its magnitude suggests that designing
supply chains with a low need for “certainty” may be as important, if not more so,

than predetermined disruption control strategies. In this setting, this study calls for
the development of a new perspective in SC disruption management, i.e., lowcertainty-need (LCN) supply chains. Structural variety, process ﬂexibility, and
parametrical redundancy are key LCN supply chain characteristics that ensure
efﬁcient disruption resistance as well as recovery resource allocation. Two efﬁciency
capabilities of the LCN supply chain are low need for uncertainty consideration in
planning decisions and low need for recovery coordination efforts based on a
combination of lean and resilient elements.

15.7

KPI for Supply Chain Risk

Quantiﬁcation of SC risk is based on KPIs (key performance indicators) that can be
classiﬁed into operational and disruption risk KPIs with regards to bullwhip and
ripple effects, respectively (cf. Fig. 15.4).

15.7.1 Operational Risks
Disney and Towill (2002) suggested the use of inventory variance ratio (InvVarR) to
quantify the magnitude of bullwhip effect as the relation of inventory variance and
demand variance ratio at a generic node (Eq. 15.1).
InvVarR ¼

σ 2inventory =μinventory
σ 2demand =μdemand

ð15:1Þ

where variances of demand and inventory are denoted by σ, and μ are the average
values of demand and inventory.
The order rate variance ratio (OrdRVarR) operates in a similar way, see
Eq. (15.2).
OrdVarR ¼

σ 2order =μorder
2
σ demand =μdemand

where variances (σ) are computed according to Eq. (15.3):

ð15:2Þ

474

σ 2demand ¼

ðxdemand  μdemand Þ2 2

ð n  1Þ

P

ðxorders  μorders Þ2
ð n  1Þ

ð15:3Þ

where x is the demand or orders in a period, μ is the average demand or orders, and
n is the number of periods. If variance ratio measure is >1, then variance ampliﬁcation is present and the risk of the bullwhip effect occurring arises. If the variance
ratio measure is ¼ 1, then no bullwhip effect ampliﬁcation is present. If the variance
ratio measure is <1, then smoothing or dampening is occurring (cf. Heizer and
Render 2014, p. 499). Some extensions of the metrics (15.1) and (15.2) for multiechelon SCs have been proposed, e.g., in Vicente et al. (2017).

15.7.2 Disruption Risks
Ivanov (2018) suggested the use of ripple effect performance impact (PI) (Eq. 15.4).
PI ¼

Salesplan
Salesdisruption

ð15:4Þ

The PI index represents the relationship between the KPI planned (e.g., revenue
or sales) in a disruption-free mode and the real KPI in the case of disruption. Ideally,
PI ¼ 1. If the PI measure is >1, then disruption reduces SC performance. If PI
measure is <1, then the SC planning was performed in a non-optimal manner.
Consider an example of PI computation for the six SC designs (SCD) in
Table 15.4.
It can be observed in Table 15.4 that SC designs no. 4 and 6 can be considered the
most robust since their PIs are the lowest among the SC designs considered and
¼1.13.
Supplier reliability is a further important disruption risk KPI and can be computed
as shown in Eq. (15.5)
SR ¼

Quantityreceived
Quantityordered

ð15:5Þ

Equation (15.5) can be modiﬁed by considering on-time deliveries only. Other
relevant metrics are order ﬁll rate and lead time variance.
Time-to-recovery (TTR) and Time-To-Survive (TTS) also belong to disruption
risk KPIs. TTS is considered as the maximum time that the SC could operate and
match supply with demand after a disruption. In contrast, TTR is the time it would
take for a particular node to be restored to full functionality after a disruption
(Simchi-Levi et al. 2015). TTR/TTS are used to “identify bottleneck suppliers for
which it’s critical to obtain accurate TTR information and distinguish them from
other suppliers where even plus or minus 30% error in TTR information will have
very little impact on the supply chain.” (Simchi-Levi 2015).

For particular analysis purposes, additional KPIs for disruption risks can be used,
e.g., VAR (Value-at-Risk), CVAR (Conditional Value-At-Risk), resilience, robustness, ﬂexibility, adaptability, and reliability of SCs (Goh and Meng 2009; Schmitt
and Singh 2012; Kim et al. 2015; Chen et al. 2017; Mizgier 2017; Ivanov 2018;
Pavlov et al. 2018; Sokolov et al. 2016). Modern software such as anyLogistix, DHL
Resilience 360, and RiskMethods facilitate the computation of these and further
KPIs at the risk assessment, monitoring, identiﬁcation, recovery, and control stages.

Key Points and Discussion Questions

In this chapter, SC risk management has been introduced. Fundamentally, there are
four important categories that need to be analyzed in this domain, i.e., uncertainty,
risk, disturbance (the so-called perturbation impact), and disruption (operational
deviations).
• Can you explain how these four elements are mutually connected?
• Can you summarize uncertainty factors and the corresponding handling
measures?
• Can you explain the seven different supply chain risks?
We have seen that demand, globalization, lead-time, and Lean supply chains can
be considered as different types of risk in SCM. This means SCs are exposed to
recurrent operational risks and exceptional disruption risks. Summarize in your own
words factors relevant to operational risks under the Bullwhip Effect. Do the same
for disruption risks and explain the Ripple Effect and give some examples of the
Bullwhip- and the Ripple Effect.
• Where does information coordination help, and when would you suggest building
up inventory buffers?
• Is the explosion of a factory an operational or a disruptive risk? Is an explosion an
exceptional or a recurrent risk?
• What are low-frequency-high-impact risks? Are these operational or disruptive
risks?

Supply Chain Risk Management and Resilience

• What are high-frequency-low-impact risks? Are these operational or disruptive
risks?
• What are effects of the Ripple Effect that can be diagnosed in reduced SC
performance?
• What are two other good expressions that you know for the Ripple Effect?
• Can you summarize major reasons for the Ripple Effect and can you give
examples for recovery strategies or policies?
• What KPIs can we use to quantify operational and disruption risks?
SC managers do not only deal with SC risks. They also need to put strategies in
place to manage SC resilience. SCs need to be planned such that they are stable,
robust, and resilient, i.e. so they can cope with uncertainty in the planning stage and
are able to deal with disturbances and disruptions during SC execution.
• Can you give examples for proactive and reactive measures that will lead to SC
resilience?
• What are approaches to support SC redundancy?
• What are the four elements that enable companies to implement SC ﬂexibility?
SC ﬂexibility and robustness are interrelated. As we have seen, risk mitigation
inventory or considering a backup location, and purchasing items from an alternative
supplier, respectively, are useful strategies. These robustness and ﬂexibility
strategies have certain costs. Companies should therefore balance their robustness
and ﬂexibility investments and possible losses from disruptions to reduce the Ripple
Effect and mitigate decreased SC performance, which would lead to lost sales,
penalty payments, and is signiﬁcantly negative from a reputational point of view.

Introductory Case-Study: SupplyOn

In this case-study, we take you on a journey into the sensor clouds and consider a
new perspective on how they could transform working methods within aerospace
supplier networks. We will begin with the most important requirement for the
integration of sensor clouds: Collaboration! Collaboration between all parties
involved. Preferably via one central platform and connecting all major players within
an industry. It was this core idea which a number of aerospace companies envisioned
and put into practice many years ago. In a joint initiative, a central Supply Chain
Management hub was launched to effectively connect all relevant players through
one single jointly used system.
This SCM hub is called AirSupply and was developed by SupplyOn. Today,
more than 2500 customer/supplier relationships are powered by this platform, which
has matured into the standard solution in the aerospace industry for supplier collaboration. AirSupply provides the foundation for all main SCM processes such as
forecasts, orders, dispatch advices and invoices to be managed in a clearly structured
and highly efﬁcient manner.

16 Digital Supply Chain, Smart Operations and Industry 4.0

As a part of this Industry 4.0 initiative, SupplyOn analyzed the existing demand
and the incoming goods processes. The demand processes is already comprehensively covered within AirSupply (cf. Chaps. 3 and 6). The challenge came with the
incoming goods process: how to efﬁciently identify supply chain disruptions, detect
material damage early on and optimize the goods receipt process to ensure a stable
production with the highest possible capacity utilization.
Now let’s have a look at the resulting Industry 4.0 Initiative that led up to the
solution and then the solution itself. In 2016, an Industry 4.0 working group was set
up to collect process optimization suggestions from all departments. The most
promising projects would then be piloted and developed within an implementation
phase of 90 days, after which a decision would be made on which pilots would go
into productive use.
Now let’s go online and have a look at the piloted solutions. We started the
piloting process by ﬁrst identifying a speciﬁc sensitive part regularly subjected to
temperature or humidity impacts during transport. This view shows where the
delivery note is generated in AirSupply. All relevant ﬁelds are pre-ﬁlled with data
obtained from the preceding purchase order process.
As AirSupply supports the possibility of “pairing” material to a container and a
sensor, the worker can now assign, for example, 5 packets with 10 parts each to a
handling unit and then scan the connected sensor number. Now the supplier only
needs to enter the number of the sensor during the creation of the delivery note. All
other processes remain unchanged for the supplier. This was one of the central
objectives of the project to ensure the highest possible acceptance level on the
supplier side.
From this point on, the parts can be monitored throughout the entirety of the
transport cycle. The new SCPM (Supply Chain Performance Management) solution
continually displays the position and the condition of the parts in near real-time. The
data here is automatically derived from our AirSupply solution. In this particular
project, the position, temperature and humidity of the parts were tracked. The
temperature monitoring was important for a temperature sensitive adhesive and the
moisture monitoring was used for metal parts. Tracking the position of the parts was
important for two reasons: to monitor the lead time and to allow an automatic
“unpairing” of the sensor from the goods upon goods receipt.
The position of the parts or the containers is displayed as well as the distance
which has already been covered. The route still to be driven is displayed. The
position information in conjunction with the condition information allows a quick
analysis on which routes it could become problematic.
SCPM also checks whether the order and the transport are within the agreed lead
time. Software evaluates the number of days remaining until the order arrives at the
plant and whether or not the lead time will be exceeded. The material planer
therefore has an exact overview on the current status of an order at the top of the
screen.
All the data such as position and condition are stored and can be used for
reporting and analytics purposes. One of the resulting reports could look like this:
By simply clicking on a container type, the graphs indicate whether there has been a

16.2

SCOM Excellence and Digitalization

483

violation of the deﬁned temperature or humidity limits along the time axis. Different
drill downs are implemented—in this case the analytics period can also be adjusted.
The analysis of the data in this chart allows a quick identiﬁcation of all orders where
the lead time was exceeded, allowing for a quick identiﬁcation of transport bottlenecks.

16.2

SCOM Excellence and Digitalization

16.2.1 Operational Excellence
The term “excellence” is widely used in business. This section focuses on SCOM
excellence. Companies are striving to achieve excellence in SCOM, but they
increasingly face severe pressure from their business environments. Outside the
enterprises, numerous changes take place in the markets and with competition. In
addition, there are various types of risks, such as strikes, natural disasters, political
instability, or terrorist attacks that signiﬁcantly inﬂuence SC resilience. An additional factor is fast changing customer needs and expectations: it is a challenge to
manage and adapt continuously changing SCs, and, as a result, also necessary to
redesign those SCs and operations.
“Operational Excellence” is often mentioned in close connection with Lean
Thinking or Six Sigma. Ballé et al. (2017, p. 8) stated that “the aim of a Lean
strategy is to learn to solve the right problems and avoid wasteful solutions.” Martin
(2008, p. 605) deﬁned Operational Excellence as “an umbrella initiative including
Lean, Six Sigma, and Total Productive Maintenance (TPM),” which focuses on the
systematic usage of these philosophies and instruments to provide customer value. In
addition to Martin (2008), other authors looked at the aspects of Lean and Six Sigma
differently when trying to answer the key question: What is Operational Excellence?
Miller (2014, p.1) stated that “Operational Excellence is the relentless pursuit of
doing things better. It is not a destination or a methodology but a mind-set that needs
to exist across an organisation. Operational Excellence is not about perfection or
performing activities. It is about providing dramatic performance improvements and
ﬁnancial growth.”
Miller (2014) enhanced the view of Martin (2008), because he clearly pointed out
that the “Excellence” mind-set (one could also refer to the corporate culture) needs to
exist throughout the enterprise to achieve ﬁnancial targets. Duggan (2012, p. 28)
deﬁned Operational Excellence in one sentence with a focus on employees: “Each
and every employee can see the ﬂow of value to the customer and ﬁx that ﬂow before
it breaks down,” and he pointed out that “it clearly deﬁnes that waste elimination and
a culture of continuous improvement are not goals of Operational Excellence but
rather products of it.” Furthermore, Duggan (2012, p. 27) emphasized that

484

16 Digital Supply Chain, Smart Operations and Industry 4.0

Operational Excellence is “about how the operations side of the business supports
business growth.”
The signiﬁcant difference of “Operational Excellence” in addition to the classical
Lean and Six Sigma philosophies are the incorporation mindset, culture, and organizational behavior for improving performance with the objective of securing ﬁnancial growth. In this sense, Operational Excellence is an element which secures a
company’s growth strategy, and thus an incremental part of Strategic Management.
Operational Excellence is a dynamic and continuous ability that opens the door to
competitive leadership and high proﬁts in continually changing business
environments (cf. Hossenfelder 2010, p. 14). The dynamic factor is signiﬁcantly
relevant at times of digitalization.

16.2.2 From Operational Excellence to SCOM Excellence
Operational Excellence means searching for opportunities to accelerate value adding
processes, to eliminate wasted efforts, or to identify opportunities for quality
improvements. However, since it affects the entire organization and global SC
players, it is much more than this (Martin 2008). SCOM Excellence needs to be
considered as follows:
• a change enabler for dramatic performance improvements and ﬁnancial growth in
line with the strategic direction;
• a philosophy of providing superior value for customer by designing attractive
products and services, as well as highly efﬁcient value adding processes throughout global SCs;
• a cultural mindset that exists across an agile organization;
• a systematic approach including Lean, Six Sigma, and Total Productive Maintenance (TPM) focusing on the continuous pursuit of doing things better.

16.2.3 Digitalization as New Driver in SCOM Excellence
When SCM was being introduced to the management practices, it was popular to say
that “the company is as good as the SC behind it”. Christopher (2005) formulated the
proposition that the competition is not between ﬁrms, but rather between SCs. Today
and in the near future, specialists say that “the SC is as good as the digital technology
behind it”. Moreover, a new proposition can be formulated: competition is not
between SCs, but rather between the information services and analytics algorithms
behind them.
"

Practical Insights With the help of smart sensors and plug-and-produce
cyber-physical systems, the stations in the assembly system are capable

16.2

of changing operation processing and setup sequences according to the
actual order of incoming flows and capacity utilization (Theorin et al.
2017). In the front-opening, unified pods technology in the semiconductor industry, robots are used in real-time operation sequencing. Collaborative robots read the information about the products from sensors and
tags and decide flexibly where to forward a wafer batch next (Mönch et
al. 2012). Amazon recently applied for a patent for a self-learning robot,
including an automatic packaging system. This robot will be able to pickup items ordered and package them appropriately, while secure data
provides the opportunity to save the ideal packaging strategy of a
product. Blockchain applications to SCs are becoming more and more
important. The central idea is to increase visibility and efficiency based
on record keeping in the SC. New cloud-based analytics platforms such
as SupplyOn Industry 4.0 Sensor Clouds make it possible to control the
SC in real-time, and plan and adjust processes using up-to-date information. By simply clicking on a container type, the graphs indicate whether
there has been a violation of the defined temperature or humidity limits
along the time axis. The data analysis in this chart allows quick identification of all orders where lead time was exceeded, in turn allowing for
quick identification of questionable transports. Resilience360 at DHL
allows comprehensive disruption risk management by mapping the SC
end-to-end, building risk profiles, and identifying critical hotspots to
initiate mitigation activities and alert in near-real time mode on incidents
that could disrupt the SC.

We are living in times characterized by market dynamics as well as technological
and organizational changes. Competition is growing rapidly on a global scale:
customers expect individualized products in ever shorter frequencies. Innovations
are disrupting the current players and business models in all industries and services,
but what does it mean when we use the expression “digital revolution” or “digital
transformation”? Digitalization is a game-changer. It will lead to signiﬁcant changes
in business and society in terms of work conditions and consumption of goods as
well as cooperation and communication in value-chains. Furthermore, compared to
previous transformations, it is anticipated that fast companies will successfully
compete against slow ones (BMWi 2016, p. 8).
Throughout this book, the SCOM principles have been elaborated. In this chapter,
the connection between SCOM fundamentals and new technology is elaborated,
such as the linkage to digital or smart factors of value creation in terms of
conceptualizing and implementing the Factory of Future.

16.2.3.1 Digital SCOM Excellence Framework
Digital technology, respectively the digital transformation, enables the introduction
of intelligent factories, so called “Smart Factories”, or adjustable (adaptive) production and logistics networks. Thus, new ideas will be delivered through the implementation of Industry 4.0. In addition to this, Big Data Analytics (BDA), the usage

486

16 Digital Supply Chain, Smart Operations and Industry 4.0

of robots, augmented reality, additive manufacturing (AM), or technology for
tracking and tracing are factors which generate digital SC operations. All these
concepts and technologies will be considered in detail in the next paragraphs of
this chapter.
To develop a starting point for supporting the development of a Digital SCOM
Excellence Strategy covering multi-dimensional perspectives, a guiding framework
(“CORRIDOR-Model”) has been suggested (Kiehne and Tsipoulanidis 2016). The
CORRIDOR-Model serves as a guiding framework for inﬂuence assessment and
development of proactive or corrective actions. These lead to an aligned SC strategy
which focuses on SCOM Excellence using digital technologies. The CORRIDORModel is composed of the following elements:
Complexity Is Growing Companies are facing an increasing number of new
products and variants demanded by different markets. They need to cope with
various information and communication channels; this requires a holistic view of
the SC and the application of efﬁcient value adding processes. As we know, the
larger a SC gets, the higher the complexity.
Overview and the Overall Transparency Are Fragmented The SC and all
relevant processes of all SC partners cannot be determined to be “monitored and
orchestrated”. However, technology for tracking and tracing and supplier collaboration portals can increase SC transparency.
Risk and Vulnerability Some external factors can easily be predicted, and some
not. Some have a big impact, and some a low impact. A SC is not immune to risk and
thus it is vulnerable, but mitigation of SC risk can be achieved through reasonable
means.
Responsibility Is Key for All Players Involved This includes compliance to codes
of ethics, codes of conduct, and includes CSR and sustainability.
Information Flow/Information Availability Material ﬂow and information technology are closely connected; this is relevant for suppliers, producers, customers,
and partners in a SC. New technology, respectively the digital transformation, is
driving change as well.
Dynamics in the SC Environment The involvement of and focus on the customer
has led to rapidly changing product requirements according to customer needs,
changing components, new suppliers, and new locations. A SC requires adaptability,
respectively dynamic networks: digital technology will have to be implemented. In
addition, such systems evolve through adaptation and reconﬁguration of their
structures, i.e. through structural dynamics (Ivanov 2018).
Organizational Structure Roles and responsibilities per function inside and outside (with the partners and suppliers) need to be clear and talents developed

16.3

Development of Technology in SCOM

487

according to the changes in the business environment. This is strongly connected to
human change management.
Redesign of the SC Redesigning the SC in connection with (new) suppliers and
partners is frequently required as part of the strategy.
The CORRIDOR-Model is a good starting point to draft a digital SC strategy with
a focus on Excellence. The framework was successfully used to assess many
industries, such as food, retail, automotive, fashion, aircraft producers, general
merchandise, and electronics. The speciﬁc aspects will elaborated in the subsequent
sections.

16.3

Development of Technology in SCOM

Centuries ago, the way people worked underwent changes in parallel to advances in
technology and knowledge. Changes took place in the past, and they are also
currently taking place in the business environment. To better classify these
improvements, in principle four phases, or better four revolutions, can be identiﬁed
(BMBF 2013).

16.3.1 Three Industrial Revolutions
The ﬁrst industrial revolution was mechanization of the production processes. Steam
and water power was used to increase efﬁciency during the creation of goods. After
this, the principles of work separation and the electriﬁcation of the production ﬂoors
took place: this is the second revolution. The combination of the separation of workpackages and electrical power helped the industry to produce in larger quantities and
use moving production lines. One well known result of that era was the production of
cars, such as the Ford T-Model, on an assembly line. The ﬂow principle and product
creation in well planned work-packages led to the ﬁnal move from craft to mass
production.
The era starting with the 1970s was characterized by the increasing usage of
computer technology during the value creation processes. This information orientation of production represented the third industrial revolution. Electronics, information technology, and the ambition for automation were dominating objectives which
led to e.g., computer integrated manufacturing (CIM). During these three industrial
revolutions, signiﬁcant improvements in terms of productivity and efﬁciency were
made.

16.3.2 Fourth Industrial Revolution: Industry 4.0
Improvements did not end with the third revolution, today we are in the midst of the
fourth industrial revolution, which is based on digitalization. In other words, it is the
decade of Industry 4.0.
There is no unique deﬁnition of Industry 4.0. The main idea is that in the future
companies will intensively utilize and connect machines, materials, tools,
warehouses, transportation technology etc. in an intelligent way. This implies the
formation of Cyber-Physical-Systems (CPS). Materials, machines or devices can
exchange information mutually, set priorities, trigger action and help to schedule and
sequence the work in process. Value adding processes will improve themselves,
which means continuous improvement would no longer be precisely connected to
the human being.
Most new factory concepts share attributes of smart networking (Strozzi et al.
2017). As such, Industry 4.0 represents a smart manufacturing networking concept
where machines and products interact with each other without human control. SCs in
such networks have dynamic structures which evolve over time. Industry 4.0 enables
companies to produce customized products in small quantities. At the same time,
large amount of variants and throughput can be increased, capacities can be
exploited to a higher degree, and stock levels, transports, and emissions can be
reduced in parallel. It is obvious that this is the outcome of Industry 4.0 and the
avoidance of waste according to Lean Thinking has reached a new level that was
unachievable before (Buer et al. 2018). Because it is in complete unison with the
classical approach of Lean Thinking, it has also been referred to as “Leandustry 4.0”
(Tsipoulanidis 2015). Industry 4.0 also signiﬁcantly enables the reduction of SC
risks and resilience (Ivanov 2018). These two fundamental aspects of Lean Thinking
and risk mitigation offer new opportunities for achieving SCOM Excellence at the
times of digitalization.
To better explain how digitalization, Industry 4.0, and SCOM ﬁt together, a short
hypothetical case is presented.

A Hypothetical Case on Industry 4.0

Imagine that you are loading a truck with fresh strawberries. To ensure product
quality, the cold chain needs to be permanently monitored in the truck with the
cooler (to meet customer expectations). We also know via GPS where the
truck is at each point in time. With Machine-to-Machine (M2M) technology,
all collected data can be transmitted in real time, because the M2M technology
ensures connectivity and data transmission (it is comparable to a mobile phone
with a sim card).
Now imagine that the M2M device in the truck is communicating with a
central monitoring center and submits the data that is measured during the
journey to a computer in this monitoring facility on a regular basis.
(continued)

16.3

Development of Technology in SCOM

The result is that the machine (truck) is communicating with another
machine (computer in the monitoring center). Following that process, the
cold chain can be permanently documented (this prevents the shipment of
defective products). In other words, we can track and trace the shipped goods
on their way. Furthermore, if the truck has a technical problem and due to that
the cooling device does not ensure the proper temperature, the driver will be
notiﬁed (avoidance of bad processing).
From a logistical perspective, it does not make sense to continue the
journey with perished goods. Based on the GPS data, the next appropriate
waste disposal station should be identiﬁed and the driver should be instructed
to go there. This helps to reduce unnecessary transportation efforts.
Also, the truck will be guided to the destination using the shortest routes: it
will be redirected in case there are trafﬁc congestions. Furthermore, the next
repair facility can be contacted for the maintenance of the defective truck,
where spare parts can be pre-ordered and the capacity for the repair can be
scheduled to ensure shortest processing time and thus highest usability and
availability of the truck. This reduces SC risk, but it also means that overprocessing and waiting time is reduced.
In our case, we were assuming the truck was bringing strawberries from the
ﬁeld to a yoghurt factory. They will need to be informed early in advance that
the truck had a technical defect resulting in rotten fruit: the expected delivery
of the fresh strawberries cannot take place as initially planned. The shipment
of bad inventory is avoided.
Although this is a very unfavorable situation, the producing factory might
be able to order strawberries from an alternative supplier or change the
production volume to produce an alternative yoghurt, maybe with nuts or
vanilla ﬂavor. The competitive advantage is generated by the early use of
available information that allows higher ﬂexibility over the entire SC and
value creation network and better use of existing capacities. Proactive production rescheduling also protects the SC against it vulnerability; even though SC
risk cannot be fully eliminated, it can be mitigated.

A lot of the aspects summarized in the short case above are related to the
availability of data generated, stored, and analyzed during the various processes.
Recent surveys by Shaﬁq et al. (2015), Addo-Tenkorang and Helo (2016), Richey
et al. (2016), Oesterreich and Teuteberg (2016), Küpper et al. (2016), Schrauf and
Berttram (2016), Gunasekaran et al. (2016, 2017, 2018), Nguyen et al. (2017),
Moghaddam and Nof (2017), Hofmann and Rüsch (2017), Choi et al. (2018),
Ben-Daya et al. (2018) identiﬁed classiﬁcations of different digital technologies
and their impacts on SCM. Summarizing, the implementation of Industry 4.0 in
SCOM is based on two pillars, i.e.:

490

16 Digital Supply Chain, Smart Operations and Industry 4.0

• networking environment such as Internet-of Things and Cyber-Physical Systems
and
• enabling technology such as RFID and AM.

16.3.3 Internet of Things
Internet of Things (IoT) requires electronics, software, sensors, actuators, and
connectivity to operate successfully. Digital technology enables the implementation
of smart factories or adjustable production and logistics networks and provides
further possibilities for companies such as smart maintenance or smart logistics.
On the subject of smart manufacturing, Hentrich and Pachmajer (2016, p. 155)
summarized that production machines and processes are going to become more
intelligent from end-to-end and will be connected. The production will be fully
integrated from planning to execution on the shop-ﬂoor and production will react
ﬂexibly when changes in the sequence or process become necessary. Production
systems will be more ﬂexible and more intelligent as a result of new sensor
technology, intelligent robotics, and data analysis, so that also lot size 1 and
customized products can be created economically. Production will increase its ability
to innovate. For example, the maintenance of production systems will be optimized
through predictive analytics and remote monitoring via mobile technology, augmented reality, and 3D-printing of spare parts. In the ﬁnal scenario, production will
move into the cloud and become an on-demand-cloud-service.
Porter and Heppelmann (2015, p. 11) stated “We will see a whole new era of
‘lean’”. Data ﬂowing to and from products will allow product use and activities
across the value chain to be streamlined in countless new ways. Waste will be cut or
eliminated. In other words: Due to the introduction of Industry 4.0, a whole new
level of ‘Lean’ can be reached because the information and data that has become
available now, is necessary to avoid wastes which couldn’t be avoided beforehand
because of the enhanced information technology, data availability and grown
capabilities to analyse generated data” (Tsipoulanidis 2015).
In sum, “Industry 4.0 will involve the technical integration of Cyber Physical
Systems into manufacturing and logistics and the use of the Internet of Things and
services in industrial processes. This will have implications for value creation, business models, downstream services and work organisation” (BMBF 2013, p. 14). The
principles around the Cyber Physical Systems are explained subsequently.

16.3.4 Cyber Physical Systems
There are multiple deﬁnitions regarding the expression “Cyber Physical Systems”.
According to Edward A. Lee (2008), referenced by the VDI (2013), “Cyber-Physical
Systems (CPS) are integrations of computation with physical processes. Embedded
computers and networks monitor and control the physical processes, usually with

16.3

Development of Technology in SCOM

491

feedback loops where physical processes affect computations and vice versa.” The
fundamental difference between the classical automation processes and CPS is that
today an open infrastructure—the Internet—is used for communication and data
exchange (VDI 2013, p. 2).
Furthermore, the real and the virtual world are now connected and this is done by
converting passive components into active, intelligent systems. Due to the interaction of previously passive systems with e. g. sensors or intelligent communication
devices, the components are enabled to transmit data and information from the real
into the virtual world, i.e. to other machines, humans for further data analysis.

16.3.5 Smart, Connected Products
To understand the power of the digital transformation, the role of smart, connected
products has to be clariﬁed. According to Porter and Heppelmann (2015, p. 4), so
called “smart, connected products” are a combination of three core elements. These
are physical components, “smart” components, and connectivity components, as
shown in the subsequent illustration. Now what does this mean? “Smart components
amplify the capabilities and value of the physical components, while connectivity
ampliﬁes the capabilities and value of the smart components and enables some of
them to exist outside the physical product itself. The result is a virtuous cycle of
value improvement” (Porter and Heppelmann 2014, p. 5) (Fig. 16.1).
The physical components are represented by the mechanical and electrical parts
or modules, such as the housing or the cooling device of a refrigerator. In addition, a
smart component needs to be added to make the physical product intelligent, i.e.,
“smart”. Examples are sensors, control systems, actuators, microprocessors, data
storage, software, the embedded operating system, and the user interface (see Porter
and Heppelmann 2014). In the example of the refrigerator, a sensor is used to
measure temperature to avoid icing or even to scan the items which are stored in
the fridge.
To enable the refrigerator to exchange the gathered information with its environment, a connection to the outside world needs to be established. This means the
smart product requires a connectivity component. As Porter and Heppelmann (2014,
pp. 5–6) state: “Connectivity components comprise the ports, antennae, and
protocols enabling wired or wireless connections with the product. Connectivity
takes three forms, which can be present together”:
• One-to-one: An individual product connects to the user, the manufacturer, or
another product through a port or other interface—for example, when a car is
hooked up to a diagnostic machine.
• One-to-many: A central system is continuously or intermittently connected to
many products simultaneously—for example, many Tesla automobiles are
connected to a single manufacturer system that monitors performance and
accomplishes remote service and upgrades.

492

16 Digital Supply Chain, Smart Operations and Industry 4.0

Fig. 16.1 Concept of smart, connected products (based on Porter and Heppelmann 2015)

• Many-to-many: Multiple products connect to many other types of products and
often to external data sources—for example, an array of types of farm equipment
are connected to one another and geolocation data to coordinate and optimize the
farm system. Automated tillers inject nitrogen fertilizer at precise depths and
intervals, and seeders follow, placing corn seeds directly in the fertilized soil.
Connectivity serves a dual purpose. First, it allows information to be exchanged
between the product and its operating environment, maker, users, and other products
and systems. Second, connectivity enables some functions of the product to exist
outside the physical device in what is known as the product cloud.

16.3.6 Smart Supply Chains and Smart Value Adding Networks
A smart product is equipped with sensors, actuators etc. to exchange data with the
environment and therefore the third criterion—connectivity—is necessary. Now
how does a smart product inﬂuence SCs to become smart value adding networks?
Think about smart products such as a car, an elevator, a train, or an aircraft and their
connection to the SC. During their lifetime, these smart products generate data.
Actually, a lot of data is generated, which has led to so-called “Big Data”.

16.4

Digital SCOM Framework

493

And this is the difference—smart products generate also data regarding the user
behavior, usage conditions, and the use of proﬁles. This helps us understand why
products might fail due to certain usage conditions. This new knowledge supports
the improvement of existing products, improved maintenance, and the prediction of
failures prior to their potential occurrence.
It also signiﬁcantly helps to improve the product development of the next
generation of products. The data generated by the smart product in use also helps
in terms of the monitoring of the product during its use (for example during the
operation of a train, the condition of its operating devices are monitored and spare
parts can be ordered and the maintenance work scheduled early before something
fails). This is important for the preventive maintenance of products (i.e. planned and
unplanned repairs, proactive recognition of wearing of components, defects of
parts). Unplanned down-times are avoided or reduced.
Because of monitoring, the right amount of spare parts can be kept, necessary
resources for replacement can be scheduled, and the availability of the product
increased. This leads to the reduction of unnecessary inventory, resulting in less
transportation, avoidance of over-production, etc. Thanks to the amount of data
generated during the product’s lifetime, indications about good or poor supplier
quality might also be possible, through the prevention of defective batches. This
means that sourcing processes, the process of supplier evaluation and supplier
development, and thus the SC is signiﬁcantly affected.

16.4

Digital SCOM Framework

The technology analysis in Sect. 16.3 allows us to draw the following digital SCOM
framework (Fig. 16.2).
BDA, AM, Industry 4.0, and advanced tracking and tracing technologies can be
considered in regard to four major SC processes, i.e., plan, source, make, and
deliver. Therefore, the areas of digital planning, manufacturing, sourcing, and
logistics can be classiﬁed. Moreover, IoT, cloud technology, robots, and sensors
facilitate the technical implementations of these technologies.
This classiﬁcation, in line with the SCOR model (cf. Chap. 4), will be further used
in Sects. 16.5–16.8 where relevant approaches concerning the usage of digital
technology in SCOM will be summarized. However, it is unlikely that the presented
approaches and technologies will only be applicable for one of the major processes
according to the SCOR-Model. The aspect of BDA might be used for sourcing,
making, delivering, or returning processes, while the AM might, for example, be
used for sourcing or for making processes. Robots could be used in manufacturing,
logistical, or retail processes etc. In essence, multiple applications and thus a very
broad utilization and process coverage is expected, as the following sections summarize. The attempt in Sects. 16.5–16.8 is to create a framework that links digital
technologies to the primary value adding processes derived from the SCOR model.

Digital Technology in the “Plan” Processes

In this section, a few examples are given of how planning processes can be supported
by digital technologies. First, we focus on BDA. Second, the creation of a so-called
digital twin in the early beginning of the product life cycle which aids in planning the
SC and its operations is given as an example.

16.5.1 Big Data Analytics
Generally, “Big Data” is a widespread expression, which is used to summarize the
large amount of unstructured or semi-structured data, which are produced day by day
by companies, their devices, machines, or products in use. It requires a lot of effort to
structure these data and a lot of work and expertise to analyze the data once it’s has
been uploaded into a relational database. The characteristic aspect of “big” in BDA is
related to the sheer amount of data, which is generated, adjusted, or modiﬁed day by
day.
Big data has been characterized in literature by 5Vs: volume, variety, velocity,
veracity, and value (Wamba et al. 2015, 2017). Veracity and value are particularly

16.5

Digital Technology in the “Plan” Processes

495

important since data analysis shows the real value of big data. BDA is based on
knowledge extraction from vast amounts of data, facilitating data-driven decisionmaking.
"

Practical Insights Pharmapacks ships the merchandise that we expect to
find in a drug store. Pharmapacks used a pricing software called “Master
Mind” to increase their market share and revenue. It updates prices every
45 min and manages inventory and sales/demand forecasts. In another
example, to produce cylinder heads at its plant in Untertürkheim,
Germany, Mercedes-Benz uses predictive analytics to examine more
than 600 parameters that influence quality (Küpper et al. 2016).

BDA has been undoubtedly the most elaborated area of digital technologies
application to SCM over the last decade. Johnson et al. (2016) and Simchi-Levi
and Wu (2018) analyzed the application of BDA in retail. Retailers must continuously strive to grow their revenue, margins, and market share. One method for doing
this is price optimization models, which calculate the variance of demand as price
levels rise or fall, and then combine this information with the relevant cost and
inventory data in order to recommend prices that could maximize revenue and
proﬁts. Nguyen et al. (2017) showed that optimization is the most popular approach
in the prescriptive analytics application to logistics and transportation.
BDA applications to SCM can also be seen in procurement processes,
manufacturing shop ﬂoors, promotion actions in the omnichannel model, routing
optimization, real-time trafﬁc operation monitoring, and proactive safety management (Addo-Tenkorang and Helo 2016; Gunasekaran et al. 2016, 2017; Nguyen et
al. 2017; Zhong et al. 2017). Nguyen et al. (2017) identiﬁed some areas where BDA
can be applied to SCM in the near future. These areas include quality control in
manufacturing, dynamic vehicle routing, and in-transit inventory management in
logistics/transportation, order picking, and inventory control systems in
warehousing. Niesen et al. (2016) and Papadopoulos et al. (2017) pointed out that
BDA can help in improving SC risk management and disaster-resistance. Kinra et al.
(2017) analyzed computer aided textual analysis within BDA with applications to
logistics transportation systems.
Summarizing, the ability and capacity to analyze the relevant data for a company
is fundamental element for achieving SCOM excellence.

16.5.2 The Digital Twin
The expression “digital twin” is used to describe when a virtual clone is created. This
means that the engineers generate an item during the product development stage.
This digital representation of the product is then further enhanced with additional
data while the real product is made and during its usage and maintenance. The virtual
and real product exchange status data are collected or measured by the sensors
throughout the product’s life.

496

16 Digital Supply Chain, Smart Operations and Industry 4.0

Porter and Heppelmann (2015, pp. 6–7) pointed out that a “digital twin is a
virtual-reality replica of a physical product. As data streams in, the twin evolves to
reﬂect how the physical product has been altered and used and the environmental
conditions to which it has been exposed.”
One objective of the principle of the digital twin is to identify product errors at an
early stage, to learn about and improve the product, and to check the performance of
the product during its usage. The digital twin can therefore be used for condition
monitoring and constant assessment of the status of the good while it is in operation
and when it collects the generated data.
In other words, the digital and the real product form the twins which exist in
parallel from the early stage of the idea, throughout the design and production
simulation or production planning, until the product is really physically created
and further during its usage, and until its maintenance and repair or until its removal
from production. Thus the digital twin has a huge potential for the improvement of
engineering, manufacturing, and for maintenance processes. The insights generated
throughout the entire product life cycle and the lessons learned from beginning to
end help companies to continuously improve their products and to offer additional
services.
Siemens (2017) summarized the characteristics of the digital twin in the following
way: “The digital twin is the epitome of the digitalization of plants and machinery—
the virtual copy of a real machine or system. And the twin is indeed increasingly
proving that it can help ensure optimized machine design, efﬁcient commissioning,
short changeover times, and smooth operation.”
This means that the digital twin provides valuable inputs for the creation of the
next generation of the product and the concept of the digital twin offers the potential
for new business models or services that are, for example, based on BDA.
Let us look at a mini case from practice (Siemens 2017), which focuses on the
potential and achievements of the digital twin.
"

Practical Insights The special-purpose machine manufacturer Bausch +
Ströbel uses software and digitalization as the key to consistency in its
engineering. It expects an increase in efficiency of at least 30% by 2020
thanks to the time saved during engineering alone. Another example is
Schunk, the world market leader in clamping technology and gripping
systems, which is also using digitalization solutions for its electrically
controlled gripping system components. This new engineering process
will, it is hoped, lead to significantly shorter project timelines, faster
commissioning, and a considerable increase in efficiency when building
similar plants.
The digital twin’s potential to increase quality and efficiency thanks to
the improved documentation of processes and machines is just as
exciting. In the future, every manufacturer will know exactly which
component has been installed with which features in which of its
products—allowing them to provide a targeted response to problems

16.6

Digital Technology in “Source” Processes

497

and to optimize processes. In its Simatic production facility in Amberg,
Germany, Siemens is already using a comprehensive documentation and
evaluation system and has achieved an extremely low level of errors in
production.
The digital twin ensures greater efficiency and productivity in other
sectors as well: with the step from integrated engineering to integrated
operation, Siemens enables the process industry to build a comprehensive data model from plant engineering to operation. Digitalization
ensures a shorter time to market, greater flexibility, and increased efficiency. This gives companies the opportunity to respond effectively to
the volatility and diversity of global markets and to increase productivity
as well as energy and resource efficiency.

16.6

Digital Technology in “Source” Processes

Once the processes have been planned, sourcing activities need to be initiated. Of
course, electronic data interchange (EDI) has been a well-known approach for
managing the connection and information ﬂow between involved companies for
decades. Other means include WebEDI, which connects partners within their
supplier-customer relationships, or the usage of Supplier Collaboration Portals
(SCPs) for the consideration of online-shops for procurement activities.

16.6.1 eProcurement
E-catalogues, e-invoicing, or e-auctions can facilitate sourcing activities. Not new,
but still valid is the fact that eProcurement (see also Sect. 3.1.1) is a core process
within eSCM since it uses Internet Technology (IT) to facilitate purchasing processes (Wannenwetsch and Nicolai 2004, pp. 91–92). eProcurement supports
companies in improving transparency concerning the supplier base, negotiations,
the alignment within the company, or supporting cost-intensive and long-lasting
sourcing tasks through a better information exchange. Furthermore, information
technology helps to obtain more accurate, fast, and up-to-date information regarding
customer needs and business processes. It also provides an overview on market
changes and supports better planning, coordination, and controlling. Importantly,
information technology better connects companies, suppliers, and customers and at
the same time provides early warning indications. To sum up, eProcurement helps
companies to reduce costs, increase sourcing security, reduce sourcing throughput

498

16 Digital Supply Chain, Smart Operations and Industry 4.0

times, increase ﬂexibility and quality, and improve the relationship between the
involved parties.
In addition to the aforementioned factors, Chopra and Meindl (2013, p. 507) saw
the following aspects as important trends that will impact IT in SCM:
• The growth in software as a service (SaaS);
• Increased availability of real-time data;
• Increased use of mobile technology.
They also stated that “the increased use of mobile technology coupled with realtime information offers some supply chains an opportunity to better match demand
to supply using differential pricing (Chopra and Meindl 2013, p. 507).

16.6.2 Supplier Collaboration Portals
In Sect. 3.1, we introduced eProcurement, Vendor Managed Inventory (VMI), EDI
and Supplier Collaboration Portals (SCPs) to facilitate SC processes with a special
focus on VMI. It is the purpose of this section to refer to SCPs as an approach to
manage the inbound and outbound ﬂow of materials efﬁciently, to manage performance, and thus to describe how SCPs can be embedded in a digital SCOM strategy
striving for excellence.
SCPs are successful solutions for efﬁciently connecting suppliers, service
providers, and customers via a platform that supports transparent supplier processes.
Generally, a SCP supports the management processes via a steering cockpit. This
serves the forecasting, planning, and monitoring of the value adding activities and
provides transparency and visibility of SCM activities. Furthermore, the project
management processes during product development [advanced product quality
planning (APQP)] can be managed to secure the smooth start of the project. The
fundamental sourcing processes [e.g., quotation requests (RFQ)] are supported by
the platform to provide production (status of goods received, on-time availability of
materials) with the necessary materials. Delivery [dispatch and advanced shipment
notiﬁcation (ASN)] of the items is handled via the SCP. For SC managers, the
avoidance of SC disruptions, the availability of undamaged components, and fast
usability of the materials from goods receipt are enormously important. SCPs are
powerful tools for these critical processes. Even more, the location of parts in certain
containers or their status regarding humidity or temperature can also be tracked when
the transmitted sensor data is processed by the SCP.
In parallel, continuous improvement processes can be run, clarity on payment
processes provided, and importantly the return process, in the sense of managing
complaints, can be part of the SCP solution. Often claim management is connected to a
practical problem solving tool that enables companies to handle complaints or defects
using the “8D Report” (eight disciplines report). The 8D Report consists of form
sheets to document the problem solving process according to a standard routine of
eight steps or disciplines (Schmitt and Pfeifer 2010). To manage SC performance, the
related key performance indicators (KPIs) are tracked and allow the SCM manager to

16.6

Digital Technology in “Source” Processes

499

identify deviations or problems and take corrective actions. The SCP can be seen as a
repository of data and information, so that processes can also be analyzed retrospectively. Overall, the SCP helps to connect the involved parties in SCM in real-time and
to improve the transparent ﬂow of information, SCM visibility, and to enable collaboration using “what-if” scenarios for better decision making. The portals also support
ﬂexibility and proactivity, leading to improved SCM performance.
As in the example of SupplyOn (see Sect. 16.1) documented, SCPs play a fundamental role in supporting companies to deploy excellently managed digital sourcing
processes. In other words, SCPs can be considered a core attribute of digital SCs.

16.6.3 Digital Trends for Excellence in Sourcing
New sourcing technologies to achieve excellence in procurement are considered to
have a huge future potential, as digitalization is very likely the future success factor
for the efﬁcient sourcing of tasks. In particular, the following digital technologies are
considered in sourcing (Decken 2018).
• Augmented Reality (e.g. to be used for the visit of suppliers)
• Blockchain Technology enables collaborative document management, payment
processes, digital signatures, and documentation.
• Data and Text Mining helps to analyze texts and data using algorithms.
• Digital Data Management recognizes mistakes and errors, sorts, and excludes
inactive datasets.
• Enhanced Procurement Platforms can be used for the sourcing processes of
personnel or technical services.
• Identiﬁcation of Sourcing Synergies using software or artiﬁcial intelligence
• Artiﬁcial Intelligence for the imitation of human interfaces within the sourcing
processes (e.g. for the reading, analysis, and evaluation of PDFs or Excel-Tables)
• SCM Security Rating as assessed and evaluated by artiﬁcial intelligence
• Smart-Contracts to support automated contract adjustments in case of changing
parameters

16.6.4 Blockchain
Initially, the Blockchain concept was developed to secure the ﬁnancial transactions
of the crypto-currency Bitcoin. Recently, the applications of Blockchain technology
have begun to revolutionize different aspects of SCOM. The central idea is to
increase visibility and efﬁciency based on record-keeping in the SC. Blockchain
applications to SCOM become more and more important to enhance the scale and
scope of digital processes along with creation of information pipeline systems and
SC ﬁnance applications (Hofmann et al. 2018).
A Blockchain is a decentralized database that exists as copies in a network of
computers. It is a chain of blocks, because the data and information stored is

500

16 Digital Supply Chain, Smart Operations and Industry 4.0

captured in blocks. It is also a platform to execute the so called ‘smart contracts’ as
transactions. The list of all transactions is stored as copies throughout all further
evolvements on numerous computers (a network of even hundreds of computers).
As a result, if an illegal or unauthorized modiﬁcation takes place on one of the
computers, it can be traced back for veriﬁcation purposes. The copies are checked
regarding their consistency from the perspective of the value (e.g., if the veriﬁcation
value is the same on all but one computer, the manipulation is detected). Thus, the
Blockchain is a technology that cannot be manipulated. Participating organizations
beneﬁt from high visibility through a secure data sharing mechanism, enabling them
to plan with a greater certainty. Blockchains store the data about the location of
assets at any point in time, the ownership or the custodianship of assets, and their
transactional status.
The Blockchain, a relatively simple technology, is expected to be used extensively
in sourcing processes, e.g., for contract management, archiving of customs documents,
certiﬁcates at deliveries, or for patent management. Contracts in SCs often involve
multi-party agreements, with regulatory and logistical constraints. Further
complexities may arise from operations in different jurisdictions, as well as dynamic
features embedded in the contracts. The ﬂow of information in an SC plays a critical
role in the efﬁciency of the operations. Regulatory processes (e.g., customs) can be
expedited using Blockchain by improving conﬁdence in documentations. This, in turn,
can result in reductions in wastage, risk and insurance premiums.

Practical Insights In the food industry, it is of critical importance to
establish confidence in food safety through accurate and comprehensive
documentation of the production process. This includes the location of
ingredients’ production, as well as methods of processing and distribution. On this frontier, Dole, Driscoll’s, Tyson, and Nestlé are collaborating
with IBM to develop a Blockchain for the food supply system. Among the
issues the companies are looking to address is food contamination. IBM
and Walmart are also researching how to increase food safety control in
the SC using Blockchain technology (IBM 2017).
In SCOM, Blockchain is also being used for SC contracts, which often
involve multi-party agreements, and regulatory and logistical constraints.
Further complexities arise from operations in different jurisdictions, as
well as the dynamic features embedded in the contracts. The flow of
information in a SC plays a critical role in the efficiency of operations.
Regulatory processes (e.g. customs) can be expedited by improving
confidence in documentation. This, in turn, reduces waste, risk, and
insurance premiums. IBM and Maersk are collaborating to create trust
and transparency in global SCs (IBMblockchain 2017). They are developing a distributed contract collaboration platform using Blockchain technology. Maersk estimates that shipping a single container of flowers from
Kenya to Rotterdam requires nearly 200 communications. How can the
efficiency of the global SC be improved? In their approach, each distinct
entity involved in the transaction is allowed to access this system.
Shipping from the port of Mombasa requires signatures from three
different agencies and six documents, the smart contract will

16.6

Digital Technology in “Source” Processes

501

automatically generate after the system receives the signatures. Simultaneously, when documents about inspection, sealing of a refrigerator,
pick up by the trucker, and the approval from customs communicated
to the port of Mombasa are uploaded, all participants can see the data,
allowing the appropriate entity to prepare for the container.

Blockchain technology provides a global tamperproof repository for documents
and shipping events, and all the data are secure and transparent. Because of this,
third-party intermediaries can be eliminated, resulting in efﬁciency, low costs, less
delay, less fraud, and the possibility to have private networks. Additionally, it can
also increase customer and partner trust. Blockchain technology can facilitate a truly
digital SC.

16.6.5 Robotic Process Automation and Artificial Intelligence in
Procurement
Automated processing to support routine sourcing activities such as “procure-topay” is another form of digitalization. These kinds of activities include conducting
price searches for items or making a purchase requisition. Although it is called
“robotic processes automation” (RPA), it is not a physical robot made from steel that
acts, but a software application that performs the tasks that are normally done by a
person. It is not necessary that the RPA software does everything, but it supports a
person in performing critical or relevant tasks. In other words, the processes are
conducted by software robots that run necessary activities using artiﬁcial intelligence (AI). AI software continuously learns and shapes its knowledge using
examples. The machine uses experience and feedback, which means that it is not
programed (or coded) to solve one single problem.
Where are potential areas for RPA or AI in procurement? Generally, repetitive or
administrative tasks can be automated in procurement. This could be clerical
activities in classical direct, as well as indirect, procurement. Processes in indirect
procurement should also be assessed with regards to their potential to be electronically supported, which might reduce uncoordinated purchasing. Often the purchasing of indirect materials (such as buying external maintenance or repair services,
travel booking, sourcing of ofﬁce furniture, or buying indirect materials like ofﬁce
supplies etc.) can be digitalized or automated. The transaction costs for indirect
materials are generally high, because of the difﬁculty of selecting goods: the requests
are more randomly placed and ﬁrms do not have one system for indirect materials
(see Chopra and Meindl 2013, p. 470). When individual procurement activities are
done by departments in isolation, i.e. without a structured approach, it is referred to
as maverick buying; a huge potential is expected if maverick buying can be limited
by appropriate technology.

Digital Technology in “Make” Processes

Many of the digital technologies that belong to Industry 4.0 have a close connection
to make processes, and are connected via the Internet. This is where the name
Internet of Things arose in relation to SCOM. In the following section, core
technologies are presented, which mainly focus on physical value adding processes,
but they can also be used in other SC areas, as well as outside the industrial world,
e.g. in medical care (3D printing of prosthetics or use of robots to assist staff in
hospitals) or in farming.

16.7.1 3D Printing and Additive Manufacturing
Historically, metal subassemblies or components have often been created by casting,
milling, drilling, pressing, or turning. Other examples regarding the connection of
single loose parts are gluing, riveting, or welding. In this sense, Koether and Rau
(2012) refer to the use of for example shaping, reshaping, separating, joining,
combining, or coating processes. Historically, often material structures took their
ﬁnal shape by material removal (e. g. in the case of milling, drilling, or turning),
which is a subtractive technology. However, there are also manufacturing processes
in which material is added. In 1990, Fritz and Schulze had already referred to
sintering, a process in which (simply explained) metal or ceramic powder is heated
and then pressed into the ﬁnal shape of the component.
According to the International Organization for Standardization (ISO, www.iso.
org, 2017), “Additive manufacturing (AM), also known as 3D printing, is the process
of joining materials layer upon layer, as opposed to “subtractive manufacturing”
methods such as machining.”
Khajavi et al. (2014), Holmström and Gutowski (2017), Feldmann and Pumpe
(2017), Li et al. (2017) described the applications of AM to operations and SCM.
Those applications reach from spare part logistics to redesigning global SC production and sourcing strategies. The core of AM applications to SCM is the use of 3D
printers at different stages in the SC to increase manufacturing ﬂexibility, achieve
shorter lead times, increase product individualization, and reduce inventory.
"

Practical Insights UPS and SAP developed a joint technology which
allows UPS to manufacture items using 3D printing directly at the distribution centers. This contributes to a faster and more efficient SC. Such an
integration of production, sourcing, and distribution is also positive for
increasing the speed of reactions to possible disruptions in the SC. In
another example, Adidas Speedfactory has introduced the innovative
technology of 3D printing to its production process, taking the next step
towards fully high-tech and automatic manufacturing. The Speedfactory
is based on an automatic production process to allow manufacturing to

16.7

Digital Technology in “Make” Processes

503

move closer to consumer markets while producing faster than ever
before.
Previously, the main manufacturing facilities of Adidas were located in
Asia, most of them in China, Vietnam, and Indonesia. Under these
conditions, the delivery of finished sneakers to Germany took about 3
months. By building the new Speedfactory in Ansbach, Germany, in an
area belonging to the German industrial company Oechseler, the completion time of one pair of sneaker was reduced to five hours. Having a
Speedfactory located in Germany, Adidas is now able to adapt production more intensively to customers’ demands and wishes.
In high contrast to the foreign production facilities, production processes at the Speedfactory are almost entirely automatic, with half a
dozen machines being part of the shoe manufacturing. First, a knitting
machine produces the fabric used for the sneaker’s surface. Using a laser,
another machine cuts the fabric into the correct shape. Simultaneously,
the shoe sole is put together from plastic on the other side of the factory.
With 160 employees working at the Speedfactory, the overall production
process requires fewer personnel than usual. In 2017, the Speedfactory
started mass producing with a planned annual outcome of 500,000 pairs
of sneakers. Initially, the Speedfactory will cover the production of more
expensive and complex sneaker models, such as running shoes, to
achieve higher quality (Welt 2016).

The advantages of such a project are numerous. Storage of ﬁnished goods
becomes less important and even unnecessary since the Speedfactory, which is
local and fast, can produce the exact number of shoes that is actually sold. In
addition, personalized models can be delivered much more easily and quickly to
customers because of the short distances. Another economic advantage of the
Speedfactory is an increase in efﬁciency because of the ongoing work of the
machines. It is important to mention that AM allows the creation of structures in
ways which were never possible using traditional production techniques. Furthermore, AM allows the simpliﬁcation of structures to create completely new component geometries, reduce the number of parts, and combine multiple parts into one.
AM also is a key technology for reducing the weight of the components through
geometry, which also helps to reduce the amount of material needed.
Companies from various industries, such as automotive, aerospace, defence, medicine, consumer goods, or agricultural tractors consider AM in various areas (D’Aveni
2015). In general, they see major potential for AM in the creation of tools, components
with functional integration, replacement parts, and the customization of mass products.
According to Müller and Töppel (2014, p.7), it is common for the additive or
generative manufacturing processes, as they are also called, to follow the sequence
shown in Fig. 16.3.
Müller and Töppel (2014) showed that a 3D-CAD volume model is a prerequisite
for all generative production processes. This 3D model is sliced into several thin
virtual layers using special software. Then, the ﬁnal product is created in a generative

504

16 Digital Supply Chain, Smart Operations and Industry 4.0

Fig. 16.3 Principles of generative production processes (based on Müller and Töppel 2014, p. 7)

or additive process in which volume elements are added generally in subsequent
layers and the ﬁnal product is created. Materials used for additive production
processes include metals, ceramics, or plastics.
For SCOM, the core of the AM applications to SCM is the use of 3D printers at
different stages in the SC to increase manufacturing ﬂexibility, achieve shorter lead
times, increase product individualization, and reduce inventory.

16.7.2 Virtual Reality and Augmented Reality
In the previous section on digital technology in the sourcing process, it was mentioned that augmented reality is a potential tool to prepare and assist procurement
team visits to suppliers. In order to understand that striking digital innovation, let us
look at the concept of Virtual Reality (VR). VR is computer generated reality. Like
many universities, the University of Shefﬁeld (www.shefﬁeld.ac.uk) operates a
VR-Laboratory and they summarized that “Virtual Reality is a technology which
allows interacting with a 3D computer-simulated environment as if it was real,
whether that environment is a simulation of the real world or an imaginary world.”
The user enters this virtual environment be either wearing VR-glasses or similar
devices like a head-mounted display. In the industrial environment and often in the
early stages of product development, the user enters a 3D cinema which is a so called
CAVE (Cave Automatic Virtual Reality).
The CAVE is used when products are designed and the engineers, planners, and
operators want to assess functionalities, tolerances, and accessibility or even check
assembly processes. The CAVE is used for example in the automotive, railway,

16.7

Digital Technology in “Make” Processes

505

aircraft or turbine industries. VR-glasses are used for training purposes for logistical
processes. The operator wears the VR-glasses and carries hand-held controlling
devices. What is shown through the glasses is a completely virtual world, and the
user can practice picking and kitting processes. The quality of the virtual representation is fascinating, as practical experience shows. Using VR, it is possible for the
automotive industry to share best-practice solutions from one site to another, or train
new employees very efﬁciently.
In contrast to this, it is important to understand the concept of Augmented Reality
(AR). AR is a technology which adds a computer-generated image onto the user’s
view of a real environment. The AR technology converts data and their analyses into
pictures and animations, which are then added to our real environment (see Porter
and Heppelmann 2018). In this way, AR enhances (in this sense augments) a real
view with an unreal additional layer: digital information or visualization are
projected on what the user practically sees. This can be compared to information
that is written on a window and the user looks through this window into the real
environment. As Westerman et al. (2014, pp. 247–248) summarized “augmented
reality meshes real-world environments with additional data and presents a revised
environment with computer-generated sensory forms such as sounds, graphics, and
video. [. . .] Augmented reality will also change your internal processes.”
AR is already being used in production today, where operating instructions are
displayed in the logical sequence of the assembly processes or to enhance maintenance processes, where a service operator receives instructions about what to replace
in which sequence by looking at the defective component. AR is also used within
logistical processes, where the pick worker or forklift truck driver receives enhanced
information by looking through a device (like an AR glass) which shows which shelf
to pick for which item in which quantity. The expression “smart glasses” is used for
an AR device that is worn like a pair of eye glasses. In the medical ﬁeld, AR is used
to educate future medical doctors for surgery, for example. For SCOM, the technology of Augmented Reality surely contributes to the generation of competitive
advantage while value adding transformation processes take place.

16.7.3 Robotics
The term “robot” was coined by Karel Capcek in 1921 (Brynjolfsson and McAfee
2015, p. 39). A robot is an engineered machine, which interacts in the physical world of
factories, warehouses, or ofﬁces to increase efﬁciency or perform repetitive, monotonous tasks. In the medical environment, robots can assist nurses, for example, to avoid
heavy activities that are not ergonomic, such as when patients need to be lifted. Robots
are also used to perform extremely dangerous tasks, e.g. when bombs are deactivated
(bomb squad) or when unknown territories like buildings need to be entered.
According to Robot Institute of America “A robot is a reprogrammable, multifunctional manipulator designed to move material, parts, tools, or specialized
devices through various programmed motions for the performance of a variety of
tasks” (Robot Institute of America 1979, see Gupta and Arora 2013, p. 309).

506

16 Digital Supply Chain, Smart Operations and Industry 4.0

Brynjolfsson and McAfee (2015, p. 39) referred to the three laws of robotics:
• A robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being
to come to harm.
• A robot must obey the orders given it by human beings except where such orders
would conﬂict with the First Law.
• A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conﬂict
with the First or Second Law.
The robots commonly have three main characteristics. First, there are the sensors,
which support the gathering of information about the robot’s environment. Of
course, there are various types of supporting devices employed to guide the robot’s
behavior and its actions, such as the use of cameras, microphones, thermometers, or
accelerometers to mention a few. Second, are the actuators (e. g. electric motors,
hydraulics, pneumatics etc.) and effectors. These might be the tools at the ends of the
robot’s arms like pliers, hammers, screw drivers, spot-welding device, and motors
for manipulation or handling devices, or lights or speakers. In other words, the
actuators are the parts that activate the machine to perform the real value adding
work. Third, there is also the control system for each robot, which can be considered
the center for its artiﬁcial intelligence.
It is expected that the total number of industrial robots will be above 3.05 million by
2020, as compared to 1.828 million in 2016 according to the World-Robotics-Report
2017 (VDI Nachrichten 2017, p. 3). Furthermore, it is expected that the annual growth
rate will reach 14%. The main reasons for the increased demand for robots is the need
to produce with higher ﬂexibility and to be able to better react to customer needs in
shorter cycles. Traditional customers of robots are the automotive, retail, electronics,
and logistics industries, who have been using robots for decades. Additionally, small
and medium sized companies are increasingly using robots in their operations.
According to Statista (2017), the tremendous growth in sales of robots is largely
driven by the automotive sector, which accounted for over 100,000 new installations
in 2016. As a consequence, robot density is particularly high in those countries that
have a strong automotive industry. For example, in Japan, there are 1562 industrial
robots installed per 10,000 automotive employees, as Statista (2017) identiﬁed.
A typical and classical example is the production and assembly robot. The robots
integrate strength and ﬂexibility to assist in production sites for electronics, metal
and machinery, rubber and plastics, food and beverage industries as well as the
pharmaceutical and cosmetics industry. Historically very these robots are ﬁxed and
immobile installations, but in the future moving robots in the shape of snakes or
spiders will be developed, so they can be very ﬂexibly used, e.g. a crawling robot to
conduct welding processes in aircraft production.
Another example is the assisting robot in a car garage. Such a robot would bring
wheels, bolts, and tools to the operator. The non-value adding and heavy work of
searching, motion and movement, bringing, and lifting is done by the machine, while
the value adding tasks of positioning, ﬁtting, ﬁxing, and checking are performed by
the skilled operator who can perform the task under much better and more ergonomic
working conditions.

Digital Technology in the “Delivery” Processes

In this context, the expression Cobot needs to be mentioned, as increasingly the
human being and the robot perform tasks in cooperation: they actively collaborate.
This is how this term was coined: it is used to describe the collaboration of a robot
with a human, thus called “Cobot”.
A similar scenario is valid for hospitals, where the medical staff is assisted by a
robot lifts the patient, when a medical treatment is required, or for drawing blood
from the patient. Mini robots can also be swallowed and then be moved in an
externally coordinated way through a patient’s body for wound detection.
Robots are also used in farming or agricultural. For example they are used to
prune vines in the vineyards (vine-bot) or to assist in pulling lettuce from the ﬁelds
(lettuce-bots). Robots can also be used for cutting or harvesting crop. In an enlarged
scenario, where you have (autonomous) agricultural tractors or other devices that
communicate with silos and the monitoring center, the expression “smart farming” is
used to describe a system of connected agricultural machines that perform tasks, run
diagnosis, provide fertilizers, and are externally monitored. Smart farming goes far
beyond the pure use of robots.
On construction sites, automated bulldozers might be guided by the pictures taken
by a drone, i.e. a ﬂying robot, or an “unmanned aerial vehicle” (UAV). During
construction work at a site, the quality of the work performed can be monitored and
documented. How many times the construction machine compressed gravel to
secure a certain contractually required density or how often certain areas were
bulldozed can be recorded.
Of course, drones can be used for more than elevated observation of construction
locations during value creation. They can be used to perform replenishment of items or
for intralogistics processes. This will be introduced with examples of other machines
using the digital technology to support delivery processes in the next section.
In retail or warehousing, intelligent robots are also used to assist in cyclecounting (also in supermarkets) or in logistics for picking and kitting processes.
Very popular examples are the Kiva-Systems warehouse robots, which bring the
items from the shelves to the picking and kitting worker, increasing productivity.
These were some examples of how robots can support “make” processes. Other
applications will be discussed in the following chapter on technology in “deliver”
processes according to the SCOR model.

16.8

Digital Technology in the “Delivery” Processes

Smart connected products have enabled companies to rethink their entire value chain
and have supported them in increasing efﬁciency in planning, sourcing, making,
delivering, and returning products. How is this connected to the subject of smart
logistics or the use of digital technology to execute delivery processes? Smart
logistics is an approach for connecting transportation devices, vehicles, products,
materials, pallets, and load units. Using digital technology and data analytics,
tracking and tracing can be performed and companies can optimize routes and
loads per shipment. This section is focusing on the investigation of smart logistical
devices and their primary application in delivery processes in SCOM.

508

16 Digital Supply Chain, Smart Operations and Industry 4.0

16.8.1 Drones or Unmanned Aerial Vehicles
A drone is a ﬂying robot, or an unmanned airplane or aircraft that can be remotely
controlled or reach a destination autonomously under using software, known geographic coordinates, embedded sensors, and GPS data. Formally, drones are
unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) or unmanned aircraft systems (UAS).
With regards to SCOM, drones can also be used for the transportation of goods
and packages. This might be to deliver goods to areas that are difﬁcult to reach and to
ship ordered packages to customers to secure last-mile delivery. In 2017, drones
were tested by UPS to carry packages from the delivery truck to the house of the
customer (SupplyChain247 2017). Amazon tested the delivery of their goods from a
ﬂying warehouse to the customers by drone.
Drones can also assist in conducting cycle counting or checking inventory. For
this, the ﬂying robots are equipped with an RFID reading device. As the development of drones, like that of robots, is taking place rapidly, it is only possible to
provide an inspiration for drone use within this book.

16.8.2 Smart Driverless Transportation Systems
Driverless transportation systems (DTS) are mainly used in intralogistics and the
warehousing. Such DTS increase safety during loading and unloading of materials
and ﬁnished goods. These devices assist operators in every step from goods receipt
and storage to order picking and preparation for shipment. In addition to the classical
driverless transportation devices have been used decades, smart features are related
to their precise positioning, guiding, route optimization, machine diagnostics, or
real-time condition or loading monitoring abilities. DTS can operate individually or
be coupled and connected.
Generally, DTS provide a higher reliability of operations due to a reduction in human
errors, leading to higher productivity in warehousing or intralogistics and cost savings.
There are numerous use cases of DTS and we will take a look at some examples.
Practical Example

One possible DTS application is the ﬂexible connection of two production
lines. Such a connection might be necessary for the onward transportation of a
vehicle body. Bodies were previously moved from line to line via permanently
installed transport stations. Any modiﬁcations are therefore expensive and
time-consuming. With the use of driverless transport vehicles, however, the
body is loaded at the end of one line and transported to the start of the other as
if by magic. DTS technology is also used for so-called mobile pickers. This
form of parts supply, which can replace ﬁxed-route supply trains in production
shops, makes it possible to deliver “just in time” or “just in sequence”.
At the Ludwigsfelde Sprinter plant south of Berlin, driverless transport
vehicles are already supplying assembly line workers fully automatically with

prepared “shopping baskets” from the logistics and picking areas. Take door
pre-assembly: where parts containers were once lined up in tight rows along
the production line and employees had to ﬁnd, fetch, and install the parts
themselves, you now only see the occasional tool wagon and data terminals.
Everything else an employee needs to assemble a side door is brought by a
driverless transport vehicle in so-called “carsets”, which contain the right parts
and arrive at the line exactly in sequence with the respective vehicle.
A trailblazing pilot project is also currently underway at the Hungarian
Mercedes-Benz plant in Kecskemét, where all materials are brought line-side
for ﬁnal assembly in pre-picked carsets by DTS vehicles. Not only does this
eliminate walking distances for personnel, it also means that at the end one
look into the “shopping basket” shows whether all parts have been installed—
a further simple and effective contribution to quality assurance.
Examples taken from the publication by Daimler AG available at the
Global Media Site: “The driverless transport system (DTS): Autonomous
mobility around the plant”
These examples above from Daimler show in detail how Operational Excellence
can be achieved using digital technology.

16.8.3 Smart Forklifts, Pallet Movers, and Cranes
Using a communication technology, the control system assigns certain pick orders
and sends them to the closest forklift, which can then be maneuvered by the operator.
In the case of fully automated, or smart, forklifts, the operations are performed
completely autonomously, i.e. without an operator.
The Auto Pallet Movers (APM) are examples of such smart forklifts. In principle,
they are an automated, reliable, and efﬁcient solution for vertical order picking.
According to the producer Jungheinrich, their APM ERC215a has a lifting capacity
of 1.5 tons. APMs contribute to eliminating errors in picking and improved safety.
Examples are automated signals, speed controls, the use of anti-slip technology,
collision detection, and fork speed optimization. Such devices also increase safety in
a warehouse by choosing the optimal speed and routes based on the environment.
Smart forklifts or Pallet Movers can be equipped with additional technology such as
barcode scanners and distance sensors. Furthermore, technology for e.g. freight
documentation, proof of delivery, RFID identiﬁcation, tracking and synchronization
of delivery routes etc. can be installed.
Smart cranes have a broad set of applications, ranging from large warehouses to
ports, yards, and the (un-) loading of various heavy freights. Examples for the use of
(smart) cranes are related to the movement of steel coils or for paper roll handling.
However, they are also used in shipbuilding, train production, and container
handling, i.e. in metals processing.

510

16 Digital Supply Chain, Smart Operations and Industry 4.0

Today, the companies that provide smart cranes also offer smart features or
devices for the modernization or retroﬁtting of existing cranes with smart modules.
Smart cranes are used for waste disposal or in container ports to handle containers
between ships, trains and trucks. A well-known example is the so-called
“smartPORT” in Hamburg, which is also called the intelligent port (HPA 2017).
The HPA stated that the smartPORT is characterized by 10 key-elements:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

Navigation in Real-Time
Green electricity from the land
Intelligent switching points
Mobile all-purpose sensors
Smart maintenance
Virtual depot
Port monitor
E-mobility in the port
Parking for professionals
Renewable energies.

At the container terminal in the port of Hamburg, automated guided vehicles
AGVs operate autonomously, and this is done with the help of thousands of
transponders that are embedded in the ﬂoor. Besides the AGVs, a complementary
SmartPORT cloud application was installed and launched in 2015—jointly developed by T-Systems and SAP (Deutsche Telekom AG 2015). It aims to improve the
operational trafﬁc and trade ﬂow as well as the overall infrastructure by
interconnecting all involved parties. In the cloud, data collected about freight,
infrastructure, trafﬁc, and location of vehicles and containers can therefore be
consolidated and analyzed. Through the integration of smart logistical devices and
an IT-system, the automation of the majority of container, truck, and unit load device
transportation between the wharf and storage areas could be realized. According to
T-Systems (2018), the developed digital transportation management solution has
great potential for new value networks because of the following factors:
•
•
•
•
•

Intelligent infrastructures for a faster ﬂow of goods;
Real-time analysis of comprehensive SC data;
Overall platform provides a constantly updated situation picture;
Better synchronization of dynamic logistics processes;
Unbroken shipment tracking improves distribution planning and delivery
reliability;
• Cost transparency by coupling logistics and ﬁnance systems.
Summarizing, smart logistical devices can positively inﬂuence SCOM processes
by, for example, supporting processes inside a warehouse with regards to safe (un)
loading of goods, more efﬁcient inventory management, or shorter picking cycles.
Smart devices can help reduce the number of accidents, increase transport visibility,
and support truck drivers. Looking at the delivery processes around the “last mile

16.9

delivery”, i.e. when the shipment is handed over to the customer, a shorter delivery
time could be achieved and the environmental friendliness of the vehicles improved.
In combination with tracking and tracing, this means SC visibility is improved.

16.9

Qualitative and Quantitative Potential of Digital
Technology in SCOM

As we know from Sect. 9.5, Lean Thinking has contributed to the generation of
competitive advantage in SCOM. Basic ideas of Lean Thinking are, for example, a
strong customer focus, cooperation, respect, lifelong learning, and continuous
improvement, which means in simpliﬁed terms that it is about generating added
value for customers while preventing wasted effort. The digital transformation with
its inventions and technologies offers huge potential, as this chapter has
demonstrated. Thus, the combination of the digital transformation with the Lean
principles is a signiﬁcant factor contributing to SCOM Excellence and the reduction
of SC risks (Tsipoulanidis 2017b; Ivanov et al. 2016; Dolgui et al. 2018). This is
summarized in Fig. 16.4.
In this context, Scheel et al. (2015) stated that “traditional lean has lost its teeth”,
which might be due to the insufﬁcient use of technology to climb to new levels of
Lean (Tsipoulanidis 2017a). As a result “digital lean is giving rise to a new era in
operations excellence (Scheel et al. 2015, p. 1).” Schneider (2017, p. 36) also stated

Fig. 16.4 From Lean to Leandustry 4.0 (Tsipoulanidis 2017b)

512

16 Digital Supply Chain, Smart Operations and Industry 4.0

“Lean before Industry 4.0”: in processes and structures, an organization must be
optimized according to Lean principles before applying Industry 4.0 technologies.
Now, not only information and big data is available, but also the computational
power required to further process and analyze it (see Westerman et al. 2014;
Brynjolfsson and McAfee 2015). This enables ﬁrms to reduce wastes which couldn’t
be avoided beforehand. Furthermore, it also offers new ways to analyze the
generated big data, to run better and more reliable prognosis, and to implement
successful measures for SC risk reduction and resilience (Ivanov et al. 2018).

16.9.1 Qualitative Improvements of Digital SCOM
The aforementioned improvements in SCOM with the help of digital technologies
lead to resource efﬁcient production and logistics according to the needs of the
customers. Table 16.1 provides an overview on the qualitative potentials of digital
technology in SCOM which uses the avoidance of the seven wastes originating from
Lean Thinking as a guiding framework.

16.9.2 Quantitative Potential Assessments of Digital SCOM
According to a survey by Alicke et al. (2016, p. 7), “the potential impact of Supply
Chain 4.0 in the next 2–3 years is huge—up to 30% lower operational costs and a
reduction of 75% in lost sales while decreasing inventories by up to 75% are
expected.” Another huge factor is the potential reduction of forecasting errors.
Due to predictive analytics in demand planning, it is expected that forecasting errors
can be reduced by 30–50%, as Alicke and his team found out.
The consulting company 4Flow presented a case at the company AGCO, where
logistics costs were reduced by 28% because of the implementation of their digital
supply chain concept (4Flow 2016). Overall, signiﬁcant improvements are expected
to be achieved over the next 10 years. Furthermore, “industrial-component
manufacturers stand to achieve some of the biggest productivity improvements
(20–30%), for example, and automotive companies can expect increases of
10–20% (BCG 2015).”
Other companies refer to productivity improvements of approximately 10% due
to the use of RFID along the value chain. Furthermore, it was determined that
increased transparency and ﬂexibility leads to optimized use of resources. In the
farming industry, up to 15% increase in productivity can be achieved (Deutsche
Telekom AG 2013). Wildemann (2016) demonstrated that productivity in the
automotive sector has increased by 10–15%. In addition, inventory levels are
expected to be reduced by 30% due to the combination of material and information
ﬂows. As presented earlier, there is a steadily growing number of robots, or cobots
(as well as BDA, 3D printing, or AR etc.) which are used across many industries.
Asche (2017) presented the impressive example that the weight of a part can be
reduced from 14.3 kg to 2.9 kg when it is 3D printed.

Identiﬁed qualitative improvements
Real-time data can be used for transportation route optimization and
improved ﬂeet utilization. Additive manufacturing AM (see also 3D
Printing) leads to data exchange instead of part shipments; 3D printed parts
can have a signiﬁcantly lower weight, leading to lower fuel consumption.
When better point of sales (POS) and consumption data is available,
production can be done according to customer demand. Irregularly
required spare parts or customized component can be printed on demand.
Digital Inventory Management or Supplier Collaboration Portals can
support optimization of supply networks and harmonize operations,
material ﬂows, and logistics.
The human workforce can be supported e.g. by Augmented Reality (AR);
to shorten the learning curve, gives guidance and reduces the potential for
human errors. Machines (e.g. robots; cobots; exosceletons, gesturecontrolled logistical vehicles. . .) can conduct e.g. non ergonomic
(e.g. heavy), dangerous (e.g. dust, heat), monotonous (e.g. sorting) or
repetitive tasks.
Smart operational units will determine the most appropriate production
sequences and lot sizes. Robots can help to reduce machine set up times
signiﬁcantly. 3D printing can help to produce samples or speciﬁc tools
faster. Real-Time status reports via track & trace and information
regarding trafﬁc conditions can help to reschedule routes.
Due to more accurate sales data, better forecasting and interpretation of
demand patterns for production planning and simulation will be possible.
Closer cooperation with customers (co-creation), will allow the production
of goods in lot size one, i.e. in the appropriate quantity/speciﬁcally small
series. For individual or rare parts, 3D printing might be used.
Smart factories are able to conﬁgure production conditions and sequences.
Items communicate independently and wirelessly with other units.
Production processes can be improved, logistical replenishment processes
can be initiated according to demand, and condition based maintenance
work can be speciﬁcally conducted: Thus, various types of overprocessing can be reduced.
Monitoring and diagnosis during operations, logistics, or maintenance can
be supported. Quality can be steadily supervised according to the Jidoka
and Poka-Yoke Principle (stop problematic process, solve it, avoid errors,
do not ship them). Better in-process monitoring of end-to-end operational
conditions (temperature, humidity etc.) increases quality throughout the
value network.

Robots are getting more intelligent and thus they can become a real assistant for
the classical workers and conduct 30–50% routine tasks. Another example is that
due to the usage of robots for machine set up tasks, waiting time can be reduced by
50% (Continental Automotive Spain 2017).
This potential varies from industry to industry and should be considered ﬁrst
indications. In essence, all sources identiﬁed signiﬁcant improvements due to the
digital transformation in SCOM. This intensively contributes to a reduction of the

514

16 Digital Supply Chain, Smart Operations and Industry 4.0

presented 7 + x wastes of classical Lean Thinking. In addition, 3D printing can also
be seen as a signiﬁcant factor for reducing SC risk. When a supplier might not be
able to deliver the goods or a supplier no longer exists, it might be a solution to
follow a strategy of producing these components using AM (Ivanov 2018).
To summarize, there is a strong link between the implementation of digital
SCOM technologies and improved performance. For example, a reduction of
waiting time leads to higher capacity utilization. A reduction of over-produced
items leads to lower inventory levels and the capability of BDA supports more
robust SC processes. In that sense, Lean principles in line with SC resilience (cf.
Chap. 15) are the key potentials of digital SCOM.

16.9.3 Possible Obstacles and Limitations of Digital SCOM
A more connected world no doubt brings many beneﬁts – and some dangers. The
previous section described the potential beneﬁts the digital transformation will have
on SCOM. At the same time, we should also consider the possible limitations,
obstacles, and negative consequences digitalization might have. Table 16.2
summarizes the chances and challenges of digital technology applications to SCOM.
The chances of SCOM digitalization were analyzed in Sects. 16.9.1 and 16.9.2.
With regards to limitations, the issues of skills, security, and standards are key points
that need to be considered. Employees require new skill sets that enable them to
conduct data analytics, run prognosis, operate SCPs, collaborate with robots, and so
on. Engineers will need to learn new ways of thinking to design parts and products
that can be 3D printed etc. Furthermore, employees on the shop ﬂoor and colleagues
conducting clerical or administrative tasks might be afraid they will be replaced by
steel and AI. As with all technological developments, there have been some jobs lost
and new jobs created. In early days, the workers in warehouses carried goods on their
shoulders and now they use a forklift truck or pallet jack. In the future, there will be
staff being responsible for monitoring how the automated systems perform the work.
Efﬁciency and competitiveness are fundamentally important, but companies also
have a social responsibility: the right balance must be found. In other words,
companies striving for digital SCOM processes need to critically assess cost,
beneﬁts, speed, quality, and human involvement during value creation. Ideas to
strike this balance include robot taxes or the need for producers to clearly specify the
ratio between human and automated value add (like a human labor depth ratio) to
limit the associated number of job losses due to digitalization.
The lack of standards is also frequently mentioned as an obstacle towards
digitalization. Especially small and medium sized companies show hesitance
because they do not know exactly if a costly investment in the right new technology
will pay off. There is no right answer to this subject. It is more the case that the aspect
of standards and standardization needs to be assessed when digital strategies are
drafted and respective decisions are going to be taken.
Another crucial subject is related to limited trust in security and cyberattacks.
Companies carefully observe data security issues, data theft, attacks, dependence on

information technology, correctly working algorithms and so on. Managers raise the
question: If all my data is stored in a cloud that is hosted by an external company,
what are the possible risks which are connected to that? Again, there is no precise
answer. The only answer is that cyber security or dependence on cloud solution
providers is extremely important and companies will need to very carefully assess
how safe their data and information is. Thus, it is another item on the list of critical
evaluations and decisions when it comes to the implementation of a digital SCOM
strategy.
Another result of smart technology in value adding processes is related to the
re-design of production networks. Companies are reassessing their industrial footprint. Companies that were initially under pressure of cost efﬁciency might have
shifted their capacities to low cost countries in Asia. Now, as salaries and wages
increase in Asian production sites, a trend of re-shoring can be diagnosed, as the
example of the Speedfactory has shown. There is also a second trend that sees
countries in Africa as the new global workbench, as (Sun 2017) described. Even
Chinese ﬁrms consider the shift of production capacity to Africa. European
companies might consider the European Balkan countries as alternative to an
Asian factory (here the main driver besides the cost of production is geographical
proximity, so it is not purely related to digitalization).
Finally, business models might also be changed in line with the implementation
of new smart solutions or new service providers will appear who specialize in the
industry of 3D printing on demand.
It is impossible to mention all the obstacles and limitations, but it is important to
emphasize that there are two sides of the digital coin. It will be very difﬁcult to avoid
digital technology in business and SCOM, but it is important to make a critical
assessment and to evaluate what-if-scenarios in the development of a digital SCOM
strategy. One very important aspect though is corporate responsibility. This is why
the human being should always be in the center of digital SCOM decisions.

16.10 Key Points and Discussion Questions
Disruptive innovations such as digitalization and Industry 4.0 inﬂuence the development of new paradigms, principles, and models in SCOM. The Internet of Things
(IoT), Cyber Physical Systems, and smart, connected products facilitate the development of digital SCs and smart operations. Digital technologies applications to SCOM
include Big Data Analytics (BDA), advanced manufacturing technologies with
sensors, decentralized agent-driven control, advanced robotics, augmented reality
(AR), advanced tracking and tracing technologies, and additive manufacturing (AM)
(Fig. 16.5).
While the individual contributors (e.g., robots, sensors, radio frequency identiﬁcation (RFID), agents, modular factories, etc.) are not really new, they are becoming
more practical and companies more receptive to using them to stay competitive. In
addition, an attempt to interconnect these local solutions using the progress in data

processing technologies can be observed in practice. As such, this trend calls for new
principles and models to support SCM of such future factories.
• Can you summarize the major developments throughout the four industrial
revolutions?
• What are the main elements of smart, connected products?
• Where do you see reasons for criticism? Discuss the pros and cons of the digital
transformation besides the aspects of the generation of competitive advantage.
• Where do you see potential to create new business and new jobs and where do
you see risk concerning job losses?
On the technology side, ongoing developments, such as Industry 4.0, AM, smart
sensors and intelligent materials, open new opportunities, but also create new
challenges for ripple effect analysis in the SC. Examples of the impacts of new
engineering technologies on the SC are the localization of production, high ﬂexibility, and reduced SC coordination complexity.
This chapter has shown that there are numerous applications of digital technology
in SCOM. Of course, the presented examples only reﬂect a small portion of the
digital possibilities in SCOM and it is important to highlight that the development in
this area is taking place at a very high speed.
• Can you give examples for the application of digital technologies and relate them
to the processes according to the SCOR-Model (plan, source, make, deliver,
return)?

518

16 Digital Supply Chain, Smart Operations and Industry 4.0

• Can you explain the following terms in your own words: Big Data Analytics,
Industry 4.0, Blockchain, digital twins, robots, additive layer manufacturing,
RFID, and tracking and tracing systems?
• Can you connect these technologies also to the digital SCOM framework and
explain how they are successfully connected as a systematic concept?
• Do you recall which suggested framework helps to evaluate a supply chain and to
draft a strategy for digital SCOM Excellence?
Immediate beneﬁts of applying digital technology in SCOM are higher transparency, increased capacity usage, cost saving, and elevated safety as well as reduced
SC risk, which are all examples of achieving SCOM Excellence by using technology
in the digital transformation.
Finally, we note that this chapter does not pretend to be encyclopedic and rather
seeks to highlight the role of digitalization in SCOM with the objective of identifying
the perspectives that can be leveraged in the near future in exploring how digital
technologies can improve decision-making support and performance in SCOM.
• Make a recap regarding the potential which digital SCOM offers to reduce SCM
risk and how it helps to climb new levels of Lean.

16.11 Case-Study “Smart Usage of Big Data Along the Supply
Chain: Big Data Analytics Between Companies,
Value-Added and the Impact of Risk and Complexity
Management”
Learning Goals
• Understand the complexity of big data projects along the supply chain;
• Understand pain points for suppliers, such as data conversion and concerns about
sharing machine data;
• Understand how organizational restrictions play a role;
• Understand the challenges of setting the right goals and the need to have a ﬁtting
project setup;
• Understand the challenges facing suppliers who need to share some data and keep
other data private.
Situation
An Aerospace manufacturing Tier1 company is in a ramp-up phase for a new
Aerospace program (for a cadence increase of a new aircraft model). Therefore,
this Tier1 company is seeking to secure its inbound supply chain with its own key
suppliers. First steps are planned to receive, evaluate, and interpret production data
from such suppliers. An affected Tier 2 pilot supplier is requested to provide forecast
and production progress data to the Tier1 company.

16.11

Case-Study “Smart Usage of Big Data Along the Supply Chain: Big Data. . .

519

Target
The CEO of the Tier1 company wants to secure his supply chain, since he has to
manage the ramp-up of a new aircraft program for one major Commercial Aircraft
OEM. For this purpose, he requests demand and production data from his strategic A
suppliers, which will ideally be available to use for his own company’s analytics.
Through increased supply chain visibility, the competitiveness of the Tier 1company
in managing the ramp-up will be strengthened. He requests that the Tier 2 supplier
listed above acts as the pilot supplier and shares the related production data.
Complication
The Chief Digitalization Ofﬁcer at the Tier 1company has just been appointed. As
budget and skilled employees are scarce, he seeks to implement a proof-of-concept
(PoC) within a few months to show he can perform and reach his objectives even
with limited efforts. As the IT department is facing serious bottlenecks, the development of an internal solution is not feasible as long as they are not in the lead for the
PoC and receive additional resources.
The Tier 2 supplier does not build upon standard a production system, but for
years has built upon dedicated legacy systems with proprietary interfaces, such as a
CSV download. The main purpose of the Tier 2 supplier is to stay in business, so he
approves joining the proof-of-concept with the Tier1company even though the value
added is questioned by some employees and the workload is already at the limit,
because of the program ramp-up for the Aerospace OEM. Furthermore, the Tier
2 supplier wants to keep control of which production data he will share with the
Tier1company (Fig. 16.6).
Frame Conditions
• The given timeframe for the proof-of-concept is only 3–4 months.
• The budget at the Tier1company is limited, but if the proof-of-concept proofs
successful, the board has promised to release a further budget.
• Business processes of the Tier 1company and Tier 2 supplier (e.g. usage of
forecast, before the order process starts) and IT tools (including the ERPs) are
different.

Instructions
Organize yourselves in teams of four people (or at least three). Answer the following
ﬁve questions and prepare a short (max. 10 min) presentation of the results.
Explore which interest in the Aerospace OEM drives the Tier 1 company to invest
in the Big Data PoC (proof of concept). Methodology wise, please ﬁll in the aim grid
below (Fig. 16.7).
Discuss the Pros and Cons of a Make-or-Buy decision in terms of the Big Data
solution in the Tier1 company. Consider not only ﬁnancial factors, but also the
availability of IT resources, time-to-market and collaboration factors, or if different
partners with non-standardized IT tools seek to collaborate.
Discuss in which sequence the following steps (which are randomly listed below)
would have to be organized to ensure a successful project. For this purpose, number
the steps in the correct sequence in the column on the right (the ﬁrst step is already
entered).
Project steps (in random order below)

1. The Tier 1 company has limited available manpower to staff the project. The
project lead is a business expert in supplier collaboration, but only can invest ½
FTE (1 FTE ¼ 1 full-time equivalent). In addition, the manager of the IT
department can only give him limited support of 20 man days, but only for 3
months.
Explore how the shortage of available internal resources is likely to impact
(a) Project scope
(b) Project timeline
(c) Probability of developing an in-house solution from scratch versus involving
external expertise
(d) Probability that industry clusters (e.g. cross-company Aerospace
organizations, supporting small and medium Aerospace suppliers) are
involved
(e) Development of new advanced IT interfaces (e.g. Web Services) versus
integration of in-use ﬁle formats (like CSV, Excel), with all their limitations
2. During the course of the project, not all (ideally) required data are available.
(a) Forecast data about future customer-side demands towards the supplier are
not always available.
Explore which impacts on supply chain security and related stock levels the
as-is situation has and which improvements are linked to better supply chain
visibility (¼ more transparency about future material demand, and from the
supplier).
(b) Different legacy systems at the Tier1 company in manufacturing planning and
execution only provide limited data export functionalities. Concretely, only
CSV ﬁles are generated once per night in a so-called “batch run”.
Explain how this bottleneck will impact expectation management towards
the sponsoring management for the scope of the project.
Which restrictions apply?
Which beneﬁts (in terms of supply chain predictability and visibility) will
still apply? In this context, explore how a high OTD (on-time delivery)
performance can contribute to avoid expensive stockouts.
3. Explore why the Tier 2 supplier will seek to maintain control over which
production data he shares with the Tier1 company. In this context, please consider
the deviating interests of the Tier 1 company, who wants production-related data
from the Tier 2, and of the Tier 2 supplier, who wants to stay in business, even if
in his own production, not everything always works perfect.

522

16 Digital Supply Chain, Smart Operations and Industry 4.0

Then explore how the Tier 2 supplier could still maintain control process- and
IT-wise.
4. Explore which beneﬁts the Tier 1 company can expect if the project succeeds.
For this purpose, please consider Porter’s Competitive Five Forces regarding
industry competition.

Pricing and Revenue-Oriented Capacity
Allocation

17

Learning Objectives for This Chapter
Pricing refers to the activity of determining the sales price for a material product or a
service. Intuitively, one would derive the price of a product or service from its
production costs. However, this is only one strategy of pricing: you calculate the
corresponding production costs, add a certain proﬁt margin, and get the sales price
by summing up the production costs and the proﬁt margin. Yet how can you set the
sales price if your production costs vary signiﬁcantly from each unit produced due to
non-smooth cost curves? What is an adequate price for a product if you know that
different customers come along with different levels of willingness to pay for it? In
these cases, it might become necessary to set an individual price for the next product
unit sold and/or the next customer who wants to have this unit.
You might think that pricing belongs to marketing. So why should you as a
SCOM manager be educated in pricing? Assume that your company has developed a
new product. Its introduction into the market should be made as successfully as
possible. Therefore, an offensive advertising strategy accompanies the physical
provision of the product. A signiﬁcantly discounted product price is announced.
Consequently, a lot of prospective customers will buy this product and a huge
number of units must be transported to the retailers as a result. This is only possible
if the responsible transport manager in the supply chain of the new product is
informed about the expected quantities to be moved so that he can provide the
necessary transport resources. Assume now that after a certain period, the market
introduction of the new product has been concluded successfully and the price
discount ends. Consequently, the price increase induces a reduction in the demand
from the market so that fewer quantities must be moved into the retail outlets. Again,
it is necessary to inform the transport manager about this pricing variation so that he

Pricing and Revenue-Oriented Capacity Allocation

can implement measures to allocate less transport capacity to this product. We have
studied the interdependencies among expected or forecasted demand as well as
operations planning as sales and operations planning (S&OP) in detail in
Chap. 12. Assume now that you use your own capacities to manufacture the product:
price variations are now coupled with capacity allocations.
In general, the demand for a product varies if the price is adjusted. A price lift
results in the reduction in demand expressed by the number of sold units. A price
reduction typically results in a lift in the number of units demanded. In this way, the
interaction of price and demand affects supply chain operations planning. As you
have read in the other (previous) chapters of this textbook, a huge amount of effort is
spent adjusting the capacities of a supply network to ﬁt as tightly as possible to
demand. Therefore, a price reduction inducing a demand increase will immediately
lead to the scarceness of these capacities. Vice versa, if we increase the supply
network capacities to increase the throughput with the goal of lifting the quantity
provided to the market, a price reduction for this product will often be necessary. We
can observe a correlation between available capacities and pricing decisions. This is
the most important reason a SCOM manager should be able to understand pricing
decisions.
If your production capacity is scarce, but customers are willing to pay high prices
for your products (services), how can you decide which customer(s) you are going to
serve at which prices? Revenue Management (RM) is a managerial discipline that
tries to formulate answers to questions like these related to pricing decisions and
capacity allocations.
RM provides tools that enable us to set every price so that we earn the maximal
sum of revenues with the deployed (or available) resources and allocated capacities
considering available demand as well as resources. It is unconditionally necessary to
manage several challenges to realize this naive idea:
• We have to consider in our pricing scheme the willingness of each individual
customer to pay for each product. This is referred to as the customer’s perspective
in RM, especially in pricing.
• We need to take the available capacities of the requested resources into account if
we are setting prices and allocate capacities for customers. In addition, we need to
coordinate the interaction of several resources if the provision of a product or
service requires the deployment of two or more resources. This is the capacity
perspective in pricing and therefore the service provider’s perspective in RM.
• We must be able to quantify upcoming customer demand to make the best
capacity allocation decisions. This is the forecasting perspective in RM.
After you have carefully worked on the content of this chapter you
• will be familiar with the concept of demand-oriented pricing as a powerful tool to
maximize the revenues from a market;
• are able to understand different pricing scenarios and their unique challenges;

• will know that pricing relies on the allocation of capacity to market segments
and/or customers and you will be trained to identify adequate capacity allocation
decisions;
• will be equipped with tools (models and algorithms) that can support you in your
pricing decisions. Especially, you will be able to exploit price-demand and
demand-price functions for the determination of proﬁt-maximal prices.

17.1

Case Study: FRISIA COASTAL SHIPPING: The Story of Jördis
and Tjark

Tjark grew up in the North-Western part of Germany called East Frisia. It is a
maritime landscape situated between the North Sea (in the North), the Netherlands
(in the West), and the Weser River (in the East). Born in the small harbor village
Neuharlingersiel, he spent his childhood as the son of a ﬁsherman who owned a
ﬁshing boat. Tjark accompanied his father as often as possible during his daily
sailing trips. He liked to be on the water and he liked the special weather on the sea.
This was one of the reasons why he decided to become a professional seafarer. After
he had ﬁnished school, he decided to sign a contract with the Navy to work as a sailor
for 2 years. After he had left military service, he started a study program to become a
captain. He concluded his training with the certiﬁcate “Master Mariner” and a
graduation document as qualiﬁed nautical ofﬁcer. Soon he found a job as the
commander of a big container vessel. Over 10 years, he sailed over all the oceans
and harbored in all major ports in the world. When he was 38, he married a women
from his home village. Her name is Jördis. She gave birth to twins soon after. Since
Tjark wanted to see his two children grow up and to support his wife, he decided to
resign his captain’s job. Today, he has just returned from his last trip to his home
town Neuharlingersiel and he has a plan to earn enough money for the life of his
family in the future.
Since he became the captain of a large container vessel, Tjark also dreamed of
following in the footsteps of his father and becoming a captain of a coastal boat
sailing along the Frisian Coast. He does not necessarily want to be a ﬁsherman, but to
spend as much time as possible on a smaller boat in his home waters and be his own
boss. From time to time, Tjark studied websites that listed coastal vessels for sale.
During his last journey on board the big container vessel cruising through the Paciﬁc
Ocean, he found out that the coaster FRISIAN STORM is for sale. The FRISIAN
STORM is a very speciﬁc vessel. Its full length is around 30 m and it has a 6 m beam.
It has been designed to sail through the ﬂat waters around the East Frisian Islands
Borkum, Juist, Norderney, Baltrum, Langeoog, Spiekeroog as well as Wangerooge
and along the East Frisian Coast (Fig. 17.1). With her very ﬂat ship’s hull and a small
draught, the FRISIAN STORM can operate in this navigated area independently of
the cyclic rise and fall of the sea level (that is regularly around 3.5 m every 6 h).
Furthermore, she offers a huge transport capacity of 180 tons and has a maximal
speed of approximately 18 knots, which is very fast. In addition, she has a crane on

530

board, so she is independent of landside transshipment equipment. The intended
price is fair since the FRISIAN STORM is well in shape and well maintained.
Tjark’s business idea is to use a vessel like the FRISIAN STORM to offer a
regular, reliable, and quick transport service between selected ports on the Frisian
mainland and the aforementioned East Frisian Islands. Such a service is not available
at the moment, so Tjark can exploit and close a gap in the supply of the islands. The
service can follow a pre-published timetable throughout the year.
To realize his dream of operating a vessel like the FRISIAN STORM, Tjark needs
to acquire cargo. Being originally from the East Frisian Coast, Tjark knows the local
transport market situation quite well. Every year, 1.4 million tourists travel to the
islands and booking approximately 10 million overnight stays. Of course, the peak
season is the summer (May until September) when a lot of general cargo (food,
beverages, day-to-day necessities) is requested from the islands to provide enough
supply to host the tourists. During the winter period, a lot of construction material is
needed to perform renovations as well as to construct new buildings on the islands.
Tjark is convinced that his business idea can be realized and he is able to provide the
expected transport services. He tells Jördis, his wife, about these plans.
Jördis likes her husband’s idea since she can understand his wish to return to the
root of the family and become an independent captain with his own vessel sailing
thought the native coastal area. However, being the mother of two small children she
is a little bit afraid about the economic part of her husband’s plan. Therefore, she
asks her parents their opinion. Her parents have never been involved in the seafarer’s
business, but they have been independent business persons for several decades.
Together, they run and own a company that sells insurance policies, especially for
business customers. Due to this job, both of them know lots of other business
persons who are active in East Frisia. When her mother listens to the sorrows of
her daughter related to the plan of her husband to open a small shipping company,
she has an idea. She asks Jördis to convince Tjark to wait for a few days until he
proceeds developing his new business.
After 2 days, Tjark gets a telephone call from his mother-in-law. She tells him that
she has found someone who could support him in starting his new business. Tjark is
curious and agrees to meet this person for a business lunch. When Tjark enters the

17.1

Case Study: FRISIA COASTAL SHIPPING: The Story of Jördis and Tjark

531

selected restaurant, his mother-in-law introduces Ole. Ole is the project manager of
the regional construction company FRISIA REAL ESTATE who is involved regularly in most of the construction projects on the East Frisian Islands. Currently, Ole’s
company is quite unsatisﬁed with the existing opportunities to bring the required
construction material from the mainland to the islands. With regard to improving the
reliability of the material provision, Ole formulates the following offer: during the
peak period in winter (October to April) FRISIA REAL ESTATE guarantees to book
60 tons payload every day and during the summer period FRISIA REAL ESTATE
will pay for 20 tons payload per day. Furthermore, a 5-year contract will be agreed
between Tjark and FRISIA REAL ESTATE in which the freight rate per ton is ﬁxed
to 25 € (summer period) and 15 € (winter period).
Tjark has calculated the average monthly operation costs of the FRISIA STORM
including staff, bunker oil, administration, insurance rates, and load interest by
11,000 €. Considering the aforementioned offer, he will have guaranteed monthly
revenues from FRISIA REAL ESTATE of 15,000 € (summer) respectively 27,000 €
(winter) for the ﬁrst 5 years. Consequently, he decides (1) to start his business with
the name FRISIA COASTAL SHIPPING and (2) to sign the contract with FRISIA
REAL ESTATE. This contract convinces his bank to support him with a loan to buy
the FRISIA STORM. Next, he guides his attention to the development of his
business concept for offering maritime transport services between the East Frisian
Islands and the East Frisian mainland. He derives the following ideas:
• The contract with FRISIA REAL ESTATE covers all monthly ﬁxed costs.
• The FRISIA STORM’s residual payload capacity can be used to serve several
other customers and generate additional revenues. These revenues (reduced by a
small amount for additional bunker costs and some administrative costs) increase
his monthly gain.
• Tjark deﬁnes the following transport services. Every day one shuttle between his
home base port Neuharlingersiel and one of the seven islands will be established.
On Monday, the FRISIA STORM sails from Neuharlingersiel to Borkum and
returns the same day. Every Tuesday, Neuharlingersiel is connected with Juist
and so on.
• Based on the deﬁned transport services, Tjark wants to offer the following
products to prospective customers: an “individual transport” of a certain quantity
to be moved between Neuharlingersiel and an island (or in the reverse direction)
or a “combined transport” which enables a customer to book capacity on two or
more services (including a return-service) at the same time.
Tjark discusses these pillars of his new business with Jördis. She likes the ideas.
However, she asks his husband a very critical question: “Tjark, which price do you
want to assign to your prospective customers served in addition to the FRISIA
REAL ESTATE CONTRACT?” Currently, Tjark has no answer to this question,
but an idea comes up. He remembers a meeting he had with his former classmate
Karl, who is now in the maritime cruise business. During this meeting, Karl talked
about how cruise shipping companies sell the rooms on the big cruise ships. He

532

17

Pricing and Revenue-Oriented Capacity Allocation

decided to contact Karl. A few days later, Tjark calls Karl. Unfortunately, Karl has
no explicit knowledge of how the cabin prices are set, but he says that a department
called “Revenue Management” takes care of the pricing. From a quick Google
query, Tjark learns that revenue management (RM) is a managerial discipline that,
among other issues, takes care of the pricing of products and services. A few
textbooks are suggested; Tjark selects one and starts to read.
The textbook of Chopra and Meindl (2010) suggests that a balance between the
demand and offer associated with a service and/or a product is of critical importance
for the creation of value since it prevents costly capacity adaptations over time. In
this context, Talluri and Van Ryzin (2004) state that RM follows a strategy that is
complementary to SCM, since it tries to level out the fulﬁlled demand. Here, Tjark
nods his head. “Yes, this is what I need: a mechanism that helps me to ensure that the
FRISIA STORM sails completely ﬁlled on each trip at reasonable prices”. He
continues to read and learn. In particular, Tjark is looking for answers to the
following questions related to the pricing of the services of his company:
• What are the interdependencies between the price for a product and the needed
resource capacity deployed to produce the service? What is an “optimal” or “best”
price for a service and how can it be identiﬁed? (Sect. 17.2)
• How can optimal prices for several customers be ﬁxed if these customers compete
for a scarce resource, i.e. if there is not enough capacity to allocate enough for all
customers? (Sect. 17.3)
• How can he identify the best prices if the services are produced in a network of
more than one resource, i.e. if a customer wants to bargain on prices for several
different services in parallel? (Sect. 17.4)
• How can he adjust prices during the sales activities if he ﬁnds that the originally
proposed prices do not work properly, i.e. are too high or too low? (Sect. 17.5)

17.2

Non-competitive Pricing

Tjark has another former classmate who is now the sales director of a regional retail
company called FRISIA-CC. FRISIA-CC is an organization that runs approximately
100 retail outlets in the East Frisian region. Among these outlets, some are on the
East Frisian Islands so that FRISIA-CC has to take care that the island-based outlets
are reliably supplied with the complete assortment. This former classmate’s name is
Susanne, and she is responsible for organizing the supply of the retail outlets. Tjark
contacts Susanne and ask to meet. At the beginning of this meeting, Tjark explains
his new business. Furthermore, he tries to ﬁnd out whether Susanne is interesting in
starting a business relationship between FRISIA-CC and FRISIA COASTAL
SHIPPING. Susanne is interested since it was reported to her that the current supply

17.2

is unreliable and expensive. She decides to give Tjark a chance and starts the
following conversation:

Susanne:

Tjark:

Tjark, I’m very interested in giving you an order to contribute to the
supply of our retail outlets on the island. What kind of service can you
offer?
Well, I want you to offer a shuttle service between Neuharlingersiel and
the seven islands with one weekly return service to each island. For each
service, we should ﬁx the capacity to be moved expressed in tons in a
contract as well as the price or rate per ton. You can then let me move
everything you want to be moved as long as the sum weight does not
exceed the agreed capacity. Every week, you pay for the agreed capacity. Would this be an acceptable setup for you?
Yes, we should start with this setting. I think, the most important issue is
the rate per ton to be ﬁxed. My major challenge is the heterogeneity of
the retailers on the islands. Depending on the transportation costs, the
quantity to be moved (per week) varies. So, after you have suggested
your rate, I will be able to give you the tons you can move per week to an
island.
Ok, I think I got it. The rate determines the demand, right?
That’s correct! Since we are both interested in setting up efﬁcient and
reliable transport services I have decided to provide you with some
information about our customers and their willingness to pay. From
recorded data, we can conclude that not more than 50 tons have been
demanded from a single island in a week independently from the
transport rate. Furthermore, we know that not a single retailer will use
our transport service if the rate per ton is greater than 100 € per ton. We
suppose that they are deploying other transport service providers in this
case to realize the supply.”
So, the rate per ton can vary between 0 € per ton at the least and 100 €
per ton at most?
Yes, this is correct!
Do you have an idea of how price sensitive the retailers are? I want to
know how many tons we lose if we increase the rate and how many
additional tons we can acquire if we reduce the rate per ton.
To be honest, we have no clear knowledge about it. In the past, we
documented what happened with the total demanded quantity if we
adjusted the transport expenditures after we incorporated several other
service providers one after another. Our feeling is that there is a proportional correlation between the announced rate and the demanded
quantity.
Ok, Susanne, I think that I have enough information now to work out a
rate per ton. Thank you very much for your support. I will submit the
rate to you tomorrow so that we can start operations as early as possible.

Fig. 17.2 Price-demand function for the customer FRISIA-CC

After this conversation, Tjark summarizes what his exercise is. He has to ﬁx a
freight rate popt that will enable him to earn as much revenue with FRISIA-CC as
possible. This rate must be set between pmin ¼ 0 and pmax ¼ 100 €. If he would offer
the transport for free, Nmax¼ 50 tons payload is possible. If he increases the rate by
1 € he will lose α tons of payload. The payload loss rate is

Now he can write down the acquired payload as a function PDF(p) of the price
p per sold unit (ton) as shown in Eq. (17.1). This function is called the price-demand
function.
This function is plotted in Fig. 17.2 as a think black line. If Tjark sets the rate
(“revenue per ton”) to p ¼ 20 € then he acquires 40 tons payload. For p ¼ 50 € he
will sell 25 tons and for p ¼ 70 € the total payload sold will be 15 tons.

Tjark expresses the revenues by the function REV(p) as the multiplication product
between the determined rate p and the induced sales quantity PDF(p) as expressed
by Eq. (17.2). For the three aforementioned rates, the revenues are represented by the

areas bounded by dotted lines (REV(20)¼20∙40 ¼ 800 €), continuous lines (REV

Tjark wants to know for which rate p he earns the maximal revenue sum. For this,
he is going to identify an optimal value popt that maximizes the function REV. First,
Tjark differentiates REV and formulates its ﬁrst derivative REV0 as given in
max
Eq. (17.3). Next, Tjark is looking for a root of REV’. The only one here is p 2 .
max
Finally, since the second derivative function of REV is the constant function 2Npmax
max
the root popt ¼ p 2 gives the only maximum of the revenue function REV. In our
case, it is popt ¼ 50 €/ton. If Tjark ﬁxes the rate for FRISIA-CC to 50 €, he
maximizes his revenues from this customer. He has to allocate 25 tons for
FRISIA-CC. The sum of earnings from FRISIA-CC is 50 €/ton  25 ton ¼
1250 €. The ﬁxed rate is called the individually optimal rate (price) for the customer
FRISIA-CC.
A visualization of the revenue function is provided by Fig. 17.3. It can be seen
that the maximal revenue sum is achieved at the rate 50 €/ton. Table 17.1 compiles
the capacity allocation for the shuttle services in the winter period made so far. We
see that the agreed rates are different for the two customers.
Tjark ﬁnally summarizes the steps for the calculation of the individually optimal
rate:
(a) Determine the price-demand function PDF(p) that maps the rate p to the
number of sold items.
(b) Determine the revenue function REV(p) ¼ PDF(p)∙p to calculate the overall
sum of earned revenues if the rate is set to p.

(c) Identify the rate that maximizes REV(p) by calculating the root position(s) of
the ﬁrst derivative function of REV(p).
This procedure can be applied even if the PDF is non-linear but differentiable. We
demonstrate this by means of another prospective customer that is contacted by
Tjark. NORTH-WIND is a maintenance and repair company specializing in
MRO-services for off-shore wind generators. This company is responsible for a
huge number of wind power stations in the north of the seven East Frisian Islands.
They have a combined repair shop and spare part warehouse on each of the islands.
NORTH-WIND and FRISIA COASTAL SHIPPING have agreed to start a common
business to setup regular supply and disposal of items needed for the NORTHWIND repair shops.

For the determination of the rate to be proposed to NORTH-WIND, Tjark ﬁrst
estimates the PDFNW( p) given in Eq. (17.4), which is not an afﬁne linear function of
the rate p, but a strong monotonically decreasing function of the rate p. Tjark decides
to use the parameter Nmax ¼ 70. The resulting curve is shown in Fig. 17.4.
The revenue function REVNW( p) stated in (17.4) now has a maximum rate of
around 99 € per ton (cf. Fig. 17.5). This corresponds to an allocation of 49 tons for
NORTH-WIND.

17.3

Pricing with Scarce Capacities

After Tjark has allocated the capacity for the customer NORTH-WIND, he
summarizes capacity allocations made so far.
Table 17.2 shows the daily reservations as well as the agreed upon rates. He
discovers that 46 tons are still available to be sold and allocated to customers. This is
the reason Tjark decides to put more effort into the acquisition of additional

customers and sell the residual capacity. He sets up a website and sends emails to
potential customers.
Tjark was able to reserve all required capacity to realize the optimal rates, i.e. the
resource capacity was not scarce. However, what happens if not enough capacity is
available? Such a shortage of capacity appears in two different situations. We will
investigate both. We assume that the contract with FRISIA REAL-ESTATE is ﬁxed
and can no longer be modiﬁed so that we can allocate only 120 tons per day.

Situation 1: Shortage in the Capacity Allocation for Only One Customer
PDF X ðpÞ ¼ 250  e0:3p

ð17:5Þ

After Tjark started his marketing activities, he receives a call from another
potential customer called Customer-X. This customer offers a maximal demand
Nmax ¼ 250 Units (if rate p ¼ 0), but the demand decreases if the rate increases
according to PDFX( p) deﬁned in (17.5) and plotted in Fig. 17.6.
The plot of the corresponding revenue function REVX(p) is shown in Fig. 17.7.
The application of the procedure (a)–(c) determines the individually optimal rate popt
¼ 34 €/ton. This rate can be realized if CUSTOMER-X can be served with
approximatively 90 tons. Tjark is alarmed since the residual payload capacity on
board of the FRISIA STORM is only 46 tons. He decides to increase the rate offered
to the customer step-by-step until PDFX indicates a demand not exceeding 46 tons:
Tjark has to raise the rate to 57 € per ton.
Tjark has solved the capacity shortage problem, but he wants to know the “price”
of shortening the allocated capacity for CUSTOMER-X. If he would have sufﬁcient
capacity, he could earn 34 €/ton  90 ton ¼ 3060 €. With the increased rate of 57 €
per ton he is able to sell 46 tons so that the revenue equals 2622 €. If he shortens the
capacity allocated to the “last served” customer he cannot realize the 438 € (“lost
revenue”).
Situation 2: Shortage While the Capacity Allocation for Several Customers
In the previous situation, CUSTOMER-X was the last customer that asked to be
served. Immediately before, NORTH-WIND was accepted and before this customer,
FRISIA-CC was processed. Tjark has allocated capacity for the three customers in
the sequence of their appearance (“First-Come/First-Serve” or FCFS). He wants to
understand the impacts of determining rates (prices) sequentially. He understands
that for the early customers the “best” pricing decisions are made as long as sufﬁcient
capacity is available. As soon as the residual capacity is less than the optimal amount

17.3

Pricing with Scarce Capacities

539

Fig. 17.6 PDF for the CUSTOMER-X

Fig. 17.7 Revenue function REVX for the CUSTOMER-X

of capacity needed, the previous decisions might become sub-optimal. Here,
sub-optimality refers to necessary revisions of previously made pricing and capacity
allocation decisions. However, it is impossible to revise a pricing decision after a rate
(as well as the accepted quantity) has been announced to the customer.
With respect to the aforementioned ﬁndings, Tjark decides to reorganize the
pricing process. Instead of immediately processing a customer, Tjark wants to
“collect” several pricing requests in order to decide simultaneously about the prices
and the capacity allocations for all collected customers. His intention is to improve
his pricing decisions by assigning scarce capacity to the most proﬁtable customers
(who exhibit the highest willingness to pay) instead of the ﬁrst arriving customers.

revenues from all n customers.
The previously described decision problem represents an optimization problem in
which the sum of overall revenues received from all n customers is maximized.
It is helpful to model this decision task as a mathematical optimization model
(cf. Chaps. 7, 8, and 12). To setup such a model, we have (1) to declare the decision
variables, (2) to formulate constraints, and (3) to deﬁne an objective function.

With respect to (1) we deﬁne pi to be the placeholder for the rate assigned to
customer i (i ¼ 1, . . ., n). We use the price-demand-function PDFi for the determination of the required capacity for customer i. The ﬁrst constraint is that the sum of
all allocated capacities for the n customers is bounded by the available resource
capacity Ctotal, as shown in Eq. (17.6). Prices must be non-negative and must not
exceed the maximal willingness to pay according to Eq. (17.7). The sum of collected
revenues from all customers must be maximal subject to Eq. (17.8).
The solving of the optimization model (17.6)–(17.8) requires elaborated
procedures. In general, and depending of the type of the price-demand functions,
the model is non-linear. In the following, we demonstrate the general applicability of
the model by using the Excel Solver introduced in Chap. 7. Figure 17.8 presents the
data (white cells), decision variable cells (light grey), and calculated cells (dark grey
cells) used to instruct the Excel Solver-Tool. The formulas in column F are as
follows: 50 + (50  0)/(0  100)*D4 (cell F4), SQRT(70^2  (0.5*D5)^2)
(in cell F5) as well as 250*EXP(0.03*D6) coded in cell F6. We calculate the
revenue sum gained from each customer (cells H4–H6) by multiplying the cell
values from columns D and F and the objective function cell H8 contains the sum
of the cells H4–H6.
The parameter setting for the Excel Solver is shown in Fig. 17.9. Since neither the
constraints nor the objective function are linear expressions, it is necessary to select a
general purpose solver algorithm. Here, we selected the algorithm GRG-nonlinear.
After Tjark has pressed the solve-button in the solver’s dialog window, the solver
tool fetches all data from the spreadsheet and processes all necessary calculations.
After this, it returns the prices in the variable cells D4–D6 (Fig. 17.10).

Tjark now compares the revenues gained in FCFS and simultaneous pricing.
First, he observes that the revenue sum is larger in the solution for the simultaneous
pricing setup. 93.92 € more are earned if Tjark waits until he has collected the
relevant data from all three customers. Second, Tjark discovers the reason for the

542

increased revenue sum in the simultaneous pricing setup: CUSTOMER-X who is
processed as last customer in the FCFS setup should be granted access to more
capacity than available after FRISIA-CC as well as NORTH-WIND have been
processed. Furthermore, the rate agreed with NORTH-WIND should be increased
slightly to compensate for the reduced capacity allocated to FRISIA-CC and
NORTH-WIND (Table 17.3).

17.4

Setting Optimal Prices in Resource Networks

Jördis and Tjark have successfully established their business. For several years now
their company has sailed with freight on board between Neuharlingersiel and the
seven East Frisian islands. All customers are quite satisﬁed since they have to pay
appropriate and acceptable prices for the transport service. Today, Tjark is thinking
about a business expansion. He wants to enter into the business of passenger
transportation. The current trigger is an offer to buy a second vessel, the SEA
DOG. The SEA DOG is in good shape and the price is fair. The maximal capacity
is 80 passengers (PAX), but its speed is so great that it can shuttle between up to
three island per day (e.g. three return-trips originating from Neuharlingersiel).
Jördis, the wife of Tjark, has an idea for how this vessel can be deployed. Her
business concept for the SEA DOG is based on the observation that a lot of potential
PAX need a transport from an island to the mainland and in the reverse direction
(or vice versa) while others only book a one-way trip. Together with the regional
tourist ofﬁce and some travel agencies, Jördis wants to offer these customers the
opportunity to book capacity for a single trip or a return-trip on the SEA DOG. These
“service products” are composed of single trips between Neuharlingersiel and an
island or between an island and Neuharlingersiel. On each of these trips the number
of seats that can be sold is limited. She therefore interprets the trips as the resources.
Table 17.4 contains the available resources. According to long term contracts
with some hotels on the islands, Jördis and Tjark have successfully allocated some
seats on the SEA DOG. The residual capacity CAPavail
shown in the right column of
k
Table 17.4 gives the number of SEATS that can be sold directly by Jördis and Tjark.

We call the set of resources R. One-way tickets require one resource, but each
return ticket requires the deployment of two resources. It is necessary that both
resources offer enough capacity. This is different to the aforementioned setups in
which each product corresponds to exactly one resource. Let P denote the set of
products. Such a pricing problem is called a network pricing problem (Brotcorne
et al. 2011).
The core pricing process should be as follows. All customers are local travel
agencies (TAs) that offer foreign tourists trips to and from the island, often with
overnight accommodation. These TAs collect the maximal demand Dijmax (expressed
as seats on the SEA DOG) in week X and submits it to Jördis and Tjark by Friday
10:00 a.m. in the week X-1. Each TA submits their individually collected maximal
demand. Immediately, Jördis and Tjark consolidate the demand collected from the
TAs. They determine the prices and return them to the TAs. All participating TAs are
collected in the set C. Tjark likes this concept, both to take the decision to buy the
SEA DOG and to extend the service of FRISIA COASTAL SHIPPING to serving
the market of infrequent, ad-hoc customer requests. They plan to put the SEA DOG
in service and start all required preparations together with the TAs.

Table 17.5 lists the submitted demand information from the three participating
TAs.
Now Tjark is looking for a procedure to determine the rates for the incoming
customer inquiries. He wants to reformulate/adapt the decision model (17.6)–(17.8).
He has to set |C|∙|P| individual prices in parallel so that the sum of revenues earned in
week X is maximized as already done. Now, four restrictions have to be considered
during the price determination:
• Each rate must fall into the interval between 0 and the maximal accepted price
Pijmax .
• The served demand must fall into the interval between 0 and the maximal demand
Dijmax .
• The residual capacity CAPavail
of a deployed resource must not be exceeded.
k
• The served demand PDFij() must be an integer.
Tjark assumes that all TAs exhibit a simple PDF for each product. In particular,
he decides to reuse the afﬁne-linear PDF shown in Eq. (17.1) where the slope
Dijmax  0
αij ¼
represents the functional dependency between the ﬁxed rate and
0  Rijmax
the available demand of customer TAi for product j. He introduces the non-negative
decision variable pij to represent the rate assigned to TAi for product j. Furthermore,

Again, the maximization of the gained revenue sum is addressed (Eq. 17.10). This
sum is achieved by adding up the revenues from all customers and all products. The
ﬁnal rate varies between 0 and the maximal possible rate (17.11), but the maximal
demand cannot be exceeded by the allocated capacity for each customer as well as
each product (17.12). The network constraint (17.13) ensures that the available
resource capacities are respected. Only integer values are accepted for the allocated
capacity (17.14).
Figure 17.11 contains a spreadsheet calculation scheme as the base for an Excel
Solver-Tool-oriented rate optimization system. The light grey shaded cells D4:N6
are selected to represent the determined rates.
The conﬁguration of the Solver-Tool interacting with the spreadsheet in
Fig. 17.11 is presented in Fig. 17.12. The ﬁrst constraint $D$22:$N$24 <¼
$D$16:$N$18 realizes (17.11). Constraint (17.12) is represented by the second
entry in the list of constraints (Fig. 17.12). Finally, the expression $O$36:$O$47
<¼ $P$36:$P$47 takes care of the consideration of the limited capacities of the
involved resources.
The Solver-Tool returns the revenue-maximal collection of 33 individual rates
(Fig. 17.13). To be able to realize these rates it is necessary to allocate the number of
seats to the three travel agencies given in the cells D22:N24. These values are in
general non-integer values. Here, rounding is often not reasonable since the proposed capacity allocation falls exactly into the middle of an interval between two
integer values. It is therefore necessary to enforce that the Solver-Tool uses only
integer values for the allocated quantities. Tjark ﬁrst extends his spreadsheet by the
cells D29:N31 that contain the distance of the proposed capacity allocation to the
nearest integer value (Fig. 17.14). For example, cell D29 is determined using the
formula ¼ABS(ROUND(D22;0)-D22). Tjark limits the values in the cells D29:N31
to 0.001 each by adding a corresponding additional constraint to the solver conﬁguration (Fig. 17.15). After the Solver-Tool re-executes, it now returns integer values
(or values that are very close to an integer value) for the allocated capacity (cells D4:
N6 in Fig. 17.14).

546

(17.10)–(17.14)

The Solver-Tool has returned 33 prices. Here, we ﬁrst detect that different prices
are again determined for different customers. This phenomenon is called price
discrimination (Kimes 2010) when the service provided to all customers is similar.
Besides this fact, as we have already observed in the previous setups, we also see that
the highest prices are realized if a product requires access to a scarce resource like
3, 10, or 12.

17.5

Dynamic Pricing: Pricing in Reaction to Observed Market
Developments

We have learned in the previous sections that the discrimination of prices for
different customers as well as demand-based pricing contribute to maximizing the
revenue sum we can earn with a resource of ﬁxed capacity from a heterogeneous
market. In all our pricing models, we have exploited the price-demand functions
speciﬁed for different customers and/or products. If these functions are properly
deﬁned then the calculated prices are appropriate. However, if the sales period is
long or if the underlying market circumstances change during the sales period, a

17.5

price-demand function might become inappropriate and, consequently, the derived
prices will become inappropriate as well. An idea for handling this situation is to try
to adjust the price-demand function and the prices for upcoming customer demand.
The next section introduces the reactive and market-driven price update concept,
often called Dynamic Pricing (DP).

17.5.1 Business Extension by Coastal Tours
FRISIA COASTAL SHIPPING grows further. Jördis and Tjark earn a fair amount of
money every season. However, they want to extend and diversify their business in
order to protect it. They discuss several ideas and opportunities, but do not ﬁnd an
adequate business idea. One evening, they sit together with some old friends who
have just returned from their holiday trip to the Caribbean Sea. They report a
so-called “island hopping tour”. This is a round trip by boat starting at their hotel
location and visiting ﬁve islands in a ﬁve day trip. Every evening they were on
another island where they could do some sightseeing or explore the island on their
own. Jokingly, one of the friends says: “Maybe you can offer a similar round trip

Back in the ofﬁce next morning, Tjark comes back to the friend’s remark and
heads to Jördis:
Tjark:

Jördis:

Jördis, I think our friend had the right idea for a new business when he
mentioned the seven-island-round-trip. Some ideas ran through my mind
last night. You know that we maintain excellent business connections with
most of the hotel owners on the islands. Maybe we can convince them to
cooperate together and offer these round trips.
The same idea came to my mind during the dinner with our friends and,
yes, I think this idea is a realistic one. It is not necessary to offer such a
round trip regularly with high frequency. But during the off-peak-seasons

it would be possible if we have a boat available and the hotel owners see
the opportunity to sell additional accommodation. The only issue is again
the pricing of this new product. I have neither an idea about the willingness
to pay for such a quite exhausting seven-day-excursion nor a realistic
estimation of which type of tourist will come. We need more information
about that, don’t we?
Of course, I agree with you. Do you remember Christina and Mark?
Christina and Mark? Oh, you mean the two young persons we met last year
during a tourist convention. They were involved in some tourist projects in
Egypt, weren’t they?1
Yes, these two quite polite persons. During a business lunch, they reported
a little bit about their projects. If I remember correctly, they were involved
in new project development. Maybe they can help us estimate who the
customers might be and/or the market segmentation for the several-dayround-trip offers. I think I will send them an email immediately.

On the same day, just before Tjark ﬁnishes his daily work, he receives an email
from Christina:
Hi Tjark, nice to hear from you and Jördis. What a nice idea to think about the “7 islands
within 7 days round trip”. It is quite special—we have also developed some special desert
round trips here in Egypt ☺. If I remember correctly, we got some surprises when we
evaluated our ﬁrst ideas and interviewed some old customers and business partners about the
potential willingness to pay. We found that there is no real individual willingness to pay!
However, the booking time seemed to inﬂuence the possible price. There were three
customer groups. We had the “early birds”, who booked early (up to 3 weeks before the
departure of our bus). All early birds exhibited a similar willingness to pay. They absolutely
wanted to participate in such a round trip. The second group was the group of tourists who
arrived in the hotels and found out that there is only desert in the surrounding area. They
wanted a guided tour to experience the life in the desert. We called them “arrived birds”. I
contrast the early birds who arranged pre-booking often from home to the arrived birds who
made on-site bookings in our local travel agencies. Again, all member of the arrived birds
exhibited a similar willingness to pay. But this was different from the willingness to pay
observed for the “early birds”. Finally, the third group was called the “late birds”. They could
be convinced to take a round trip by progressive on-site advertising to complete a “perfect
holiday experience”. All late birds have a similar willingness to pay, but it was quite high
compared to the willingness to pay observed for the two other groups (I suspect that they are
quite relaxed and in a good mood). I hope that my experience helps you to develop your own
business. Please let me know about your success. Hope to see you again, Christina.

Jördis also reads the email reply. Both discuss the content and soon ﬁnd out that
the decision situation differs signiﬁcantly from the decision scenarios before. The
pricing scenarios investigated so far report scenarios with the necessity of assigning
individual prices to individual customers (or groups of customers). The determined
prices were not changed during the complete sales period. Here, it is necessary to

1

17.5

551

assign different prices to different parts of the sales period, but these prices apply for
all customers (so they are announced to all customers). In summary, they discovered:
• Early birds book during the ﬁrst third of the booking period and pay a price of p1
per person.
• Arrived birds book during the second third of the booking period and accept the
price p2.
• Late birds book during the ﬁnal third of the booking period and a price of p3 is
possible.
Again, a conversation about the new business opportunity is initiated between
Jördis and Tjark.

This is funny. There are different prices for the same product, but the price
is determined mainly by the time it is sold.
That is true, but the booking time is strongly connected to a special group
of customers.
“Yes, you are right. Do you think that we could assume we also have a
similar segmentation of potential customers? This is a necessary prerequisite if we want to start the round-trip business.
Well, a deﬁnitive answer is impossible, but I think, yes, there are some
similarities between the two cases in the desert and here at the Frisian
Coast. Maybe the early birds would be formed by all those tourists who
have dreamed about a cruise trip, but do not want or cannot effort to do it
on the regular cruise vessels abroad.
Oh, that’s a good idea. These persons will make a longer plan and book
quite early. In another case, we often have very bad weather conditions
here in the region. All those customers who have booked a 2 week stay
could be convinced to take the island round trip if the weather conditions
are bad after they have arrived and they realize that it is absolutely
impossible to spend the next days on a beach side. This would be our
group of arrived birds.
Correct, and here is the third group, the late birds: all tourists who have
arrived and who discover that besides the pure nature there is nothing to
experience here. For them, such a cruise can be a very interesting experience full of highlights.
“Haha, now you are exaggerating. But in general, you are right. What do
you think: should we go ahead with the development of our business idea?
Yes, I think we should go ahead. However, I see one big challenge: it is
again the pricing. How can we decide when to change the price and which
prices should we use?
We should investigate variable prices. Maybe we can re-apply some of the
price-setting tools we have already used.

552

Pricing and Revenue-Oriented Capacity Allocation

Jördis and Tjark start learning about the variation of product prices. Customers
recognize these price updates as variable prices during the sales period. Here,
variable pricing describes the general idea of adjusting the price of a product at
certain times during the sales period (McCarthy 2010). There are different
implementations of variable prices.
• Seasonal pricing implements price adjustments and the time of the price updates
are announced to the customers, so that the customers can anticipate (or even
know) when a price will be updated. It is not necessary in seasonal pricing that
customers are informed about the time and extent of price adjustments, but it is
necessary that the service provider knows exactly when and how much the prices
are updated. In seasonal pricing, the prices do not depend on the actual realized
demand.
• In Dynamic Pricing (DP), the update of a price is mainly triggered by an
exogenous factor like the incoming market demand. The service provider sets
the rules for the price update, but has only limited (or even no) control of the time
and extent of the price adjustment (Maglaras and Meissner 2006).
In the reminder of this section, we accompany Jördis and Tjark and report their
ﬁndings about DP issues and the application to the decision scenario for the sales of
the coastal tour tickets.

17.5.2 Decision Situation Modelling
It is necessary to partition the complete sales period S into T sales sub-periods S1, . . .,
ST. A price pt (t ¼ 1, . . ., T) has to be ﬁxed for every sales sub-period. If we know the
price as well as the quantity qt sold in period t, then we calculate the revenue gained
in period t by ptqt. Summing up these products over all sales periods determines the
sum of gained revenues. This means we are looking for a set of optimal prices that
maximizes the revenue sum earned over the complete sales period S. Again, an
optimization problem has to be solved. A set of prices must be ﬁxed.
If we assume that the willingness to pay in each sub-period is homogeneous for
all customers in a sub-period, and if we assume that the price pt is a function ft of the
offered quantity described by a known PDF ft, i.e. pt ¼ ft(qt), then we are able
formulate the decision situation as a mathematical optimization model.

The optimization tries to maximize the sum of earned revenues over all
sub-periods (17.15). We can further assume that during the complete sales period
only a limited capacity CAP can be allocated for the accepted customer requests.
This restriction is expressed by constraint (17.16).

ð17:17Þ

f t ðpt Þ ∈ f0; 1; 2; . . .g 8t ∈ f1; . . . ; Tg

ð17:18Þ

Since the quantity qt represents the number of tickets to be sold in period t, this
number must be non-negative and is not allowed to exceed the maximal demand
(17.17). Furthermore, the quantities are restricted to integer numbers (17.18).
0  pt  ptmax 8t ∈ f1; . . . ; T g

ð17:19Þ

Of course, each period-speciﬁc price must be non-negative and must not exceed
the period speciﬁc maximal price Ptmax (17.19).
The mathematical optimization model (17.15)–(17.19) represents the decision
task of determining several prices pt simultaneously for all sub-periods. The exploitation of the PDFs f1, . . ., fT also determines the quantity qt offered in each period t to
achieve the sales price pt. Solving this model means ﬁnding the best partition of the
available capacity over all sub-periods. A certain amount of the available capacity is
assigned to each period. Again, this model is very complicated to solve since the
objective function (17.15) is, in general, non-linear like the two constraints (17.16)
and (17.17). In Sect. 17.5.3, we will explain how the best capacity distribution over
all sales periods is made. We will use the following example that represents the
pricing task for the island-trip scenario of Jördis and Tjark.
With the help of some business partners like the regional tourist ofﬁce, some hotel
owners, and a market review, Jördis and Tjark have conﬁrmed that the split up of the
sales period into three sub-periods to address the three outlined customer groups is
reasonable. Furthermore, they have decided to use PFDs f1, f2 as well as f3 of the
form (17.1) with the parameters given in Table 17.6.
Jördis and Tjark decide to plan the deployment of a boat with a capacity of CAP ¼
100 passengers for the ﬁrst attempt. They decided to use a booking period comprising T ¼ 3 consecutive weeks before the boat’s departure. It is expected that the early
birds will book in the ﬁrst week, the arrived birds in the second week and, ﬁnally, the
late birds in the third and ﬁnal week. It is necessary to determine three prices p1, p2 as
well as p3 for the island round trip. We are now ready to setup the model (17.15)–
(17.19) for the island round trip sales scenario.

17.5.3 Pricing and Capacity Distribution over the Sales Period
Jördis and Tjark need to ﬁnd the three optimal prices. The objective function (17.20)
is not linear, but quadratic. In addition, 10 restrictions must be considered while
evaluating different price vectors p ¼ ( p1, p2, p3). Therefore, a manual calculation of
the best prices is not a good idea. However, due to the non-linearity of the objective
function, the application of linear programming (Chap. 12) is not possible. To
approximate the best price decisions, we can apply the Excel Solver-Tool again
using a heuristic that applies some rules to determine the prices, but which does not
provides any information about the quality of the returned solution.

17.5.3.1 Using the Excel-Solver-Tool
A spread-sheet that contains all information for the pricing problem is given in
Fig. 17.16. White cells contain values that are parameters of the scenario. Greyshaded cell contain derived or calculated values and the black cells are reserved to
host the decided prices. Again, it is necessary to ensure that the determined price pi

17.5

Dynamic Pricing: Pricing in Reaction to Observed Market Developments

555

Fig. 17.16 Spreadsheet that contains all information associated with the optimization model
(17.20)–(17.24) used by Jördis

(row 15) is associated with an integer value for the associated number of tickets/
passengers (PAX) qi (row 9). We use again the technique to specify a maximal
allowed deviation (given in row 12) from an integer value (given in row 10).
The required Solver-Tool conﬁguration is presented in Fig. 17.17. Since we do
not have a linear optimization model (Chap. 12), we cannot use a simplex-algorithmbased solving method. Therefore, we select the evolutionary algorithm. This is an
algorithm to identify feasible solutions with good objective function values. However, the returned solution is not necessarily an optimal solution since the evolutionary algorithm cannot be proved to return optimal solutions. It is a heuristic, which
means that is follows some rules to identify a feasible solution without any guarantee
that this solution is optimal.
Jördis sets up the aforementioned spreadsheet and conﬁgures the Solver-Tool.
She starts the solver and after a long period a solution is returned into the spreadsheet
shown in Fig. 17.18. The complete capacity is allocated. However, the price for the
second sales period is set to 0. Consequently, only the ﬁrst as well as the last period
contribute to the total revenue of 3500 €. Jördis is worried about this result. If she
manually inserts the tentative price of 33.32 € for the second period then she
observes an increase in the total revenue of 5232 € (Fig. 17.19) though only
90 out of 100 tickets are sold.
Tjark also experiments with the spreadsheet tool. Surprisingly, Tjark reported a
completely different result, as shown in Fig. 17.20. For the ﬁrst week, the price is set
to 126.00 €, for the second week it is 100.00 €, and for the third week it is 87.50 €.
The expected numbers of bookings are 16 (week 1), 30 (week 2) and 40 (week 3), so
that 86 tickets will be sold in total. The total revenue sum is 8515.95 €.

Jördis wants to know how her husband got these very different price proposals.
He explains that he has manually inserted the prices p1 ¼ 150 €, p2 ¼ 50 € as well as
p3 ¼ 100 € and, without having cleared the cells D15:F15, he started the solver.
Both Jördis and Tjark discuss their ﬁndings. They conclude that the solver
approach is not a reliable tool for their purpose. They want to have a more trustful
and transparent procedure for price determination over all periods.

17.5.3.2 Pricing Heuristic
Jördis and Tjark consult the textbook by Talluri and van Ryzin (2004) to learn about
alternative procedures for the determination of the prices for the different periods.
Finally, they ﬁnd a procedure. It is based on the idea of consecutively distributing all
capacity units over the available periods based on their marginal proﬁt. The procedure works as follows: the marginal proﬁt of the ﬁrst ticket is calculated for each of
the three periods. The period p* with the highest marginal proﬁt is identiﬁed. If the
marginal proﬁt is positive then the ﬁrst ticket is assigned to period p*. Otherwise, the
procedure stops since no positive proﬁt margin is achieved anymore. The iteration

558

17

Pricing and Revenue-Oriented Capacity Allocation

step is complete. In the second iteration, the marginal prices are determined again for
all periods. The period with the highest positive marginal proﬁt receives the second
ticket and so on. This iterative stops if all tickets are distributed or only negative
marginal proﬁts are observed for all periods.
The PDF f1 maps the price determined for a ticket in period 1 to the number of
tickets to be sold in the ﬁrst period. Jördis and Tjark wants to know how much the
revenue sum increases if an additional ticket is sold in the ﬁrst period. It is therefore
necessary to know which price is appropriate if a desired number of tickets should be
sold in the ﬁrst period. Therefore, they search for an appropriate Demand-PriceFunction (DPF) g1 for the ﬁrst period. This DPF has the property g1( f1( p)) ¼ p, so
that g1 can be interpreted as the inverse function of the PDF f1.
In general, an afﬁne linear function f ¼ a  bx has the inverse function gðyÞ
¼ ab  1b y, since we have gð f ðxÞÞ ¼ ab  1b f ðxÞ ¼ ab  1b ða  bxÞ ¼ ab  ab þ x ¼ x.

Table 17.7 contains the resulting DPFs g1, g2, g3 for the three periods. They can
be used to determine the required price gi(q) to sell the quantity q in period i. Jördis
and Tjark can use these DPFs to conduct a quantity-based revenue calculation for
each period. Therefore, they have to multiply the intended selling quantity q with the
associated market price gi(q) in period i. The function Ri ðqi Þ≔qi ∙ gi ðqi Þ calculates the
period-speciﬁc revenue sum depending on the quantity qi assigned to period i. The
three functions are deﬁned in (17.25)–(17.27) and printed in Fig. 17.21.
Assume now that Jördis and Tjark have not yet assigned any capacity unit to a
period, i.e. q1 ¼ 0, q2 ¼ 0 and q3 ¼ 0. Now, they wanted to earn the maximal
possible additional revenue with the ﬁrst capacity unit (which corresponds to the ﬁrst
ticket). As can be seen in Fig. 17.21, the steepest ascent is achieved in the dashed
graph which belongs to period 2. This means the ﬁrst ticket earns the maximal
revenue sum in period 2. So, the ﬁrst ticket should be sold (and therefore be
assigned) to period 2 and we update q2 ¼ q2 + 1 ¼ 1.

Now the second ticket has to be distributed and assigned to one of the three
periods. In order to enable the calculation of the revenue increase caused by the next
ticket in the three different periods we can use the ﬁrst derivative functions R1 0 ðq1 Þ,
R2 0 ðq2 Þ and R3 0 ðq3 Þ of the period-speciﬁc DPFs. These are shown in (17.28)–(17.30).
Jördis and Tjark have to compare the values
R1 0 ð0Þ ¼ 150
€,

580=
R2 ð1Þ ¼ 3  193:30 € and R3 ð0Þ ¼ 175 €. Again, the highest revenue increase
is observed for period 2 so that also the second ticket goes to period 2 and we update
q2 ¼ q2 + 1 ¼ 2. Next, R1 0 ð0Þ ¼ 150 €, R2 0 ð2Þ ¼ 560=3  186:67 € and R3 0 ð0Þ ¼ 175 €.
The third ticket is assigned to period 2 and it is q2 ¼ q2 + 1 ¼ 3. For the fourth ticket,
Jördis and Tjark continue with the comparison of R1 0 ð0Þ ¼ 150 €, R2 0 ð3Þ ¼ 180 €
and R3 0 ð0Þ ¼ 175 € so that also the fourth ticket is sold in period 2. For the ﬁfth
ticket, Jördis and Tjark get R1 0 ð0Þ ¼ 150 €, R2 0 ð4Þ ¼ 520=3  173:3 € and R3 0 ð0Þ
¼ 175 €. Now, the third period is the best period and it is q3 ¼ q3 + 1 ¼ 1. For the
sixth ticket, it is necessary to compare R1 0 ð0Þ ¼ 150 €, R2 0 ð4Þ ¼ 520=3  173:30 € and
R3 0 ð1Þ ¼ 170:63 €. As a result, the sixth ticket is sold in period 2 and the update q2 ¼
q2 + 1 ¼ 5 is made and so on.
Table 17.8 contains the complete distribution procedure over 100 iterations
(100 tickets).
The major result of this distribution procedure is that after the complete procedure
has terminated we see that q1 ¼ 40 tickets are sold in period 1, q2 ¼ 26 tickets are

brought into the market in the second period and the remaining q3 ¼ 34 tickets are
sold in period 3. Using the three period-speciﬁc DPFs Jördis and Tjark can calculate
the appropriate prices p1, p2 as well as p3. They determine p1 ¼ g1(40) ¼ 90 €, p2 ¼
g2(26) ¼ 113.33 € and p3 ¼ g3(34) ¼ 100.63 €. The total revenue is 40  90 € +
26  113.33 € + 34  100.63 € ¼ 9968 €.

17.5.3.3 Reactive Price Updating
Before Jördis and Tjark start the ﬁrst sales period for the island round trips, they
summarize what they have done in the round trip pricing process:
Tjark:

Actually, we have assigned a price to each sales period and each of the
prices depends on the quantity we plan to sell there. We update the price
for the round trip so that we have a variable pricing scheme. So far, I got
the clue. But is this really a DYNAMIC pricing approach? The prospective

17.5

Jördis:

Jördis:

561

customers do not know when and how we update the price for the round
trip, but we do know it. So where is the surprising and a priori unknown
element?
If we sell exactly 40 tickets in the ﬁrst period then we do not need to update
the prices p2 and p3. We can reveal p2 to the customer at the beginning of
the second sales period. However, if the capacity (number of ticket)
assigned to a period is exhausted before the ﬁrst period is over, we have
greater than expected demand which means that less capacity is left for the
two remaining periods. Due to this demand underestimation, we have to
update the remaining capacity and its distribution over the last two periods.
Compared to the initial planning, we have less capacity so that the prices p2
as well as p3 should be increased (too much demand, demand under
estimation). Since we do not know the actual realized demand in sales
period 1 or even a priori if and when 40 tickets will be sold, we do not
know in advance when the ticket prices have to be updated and by
how much.
Ok, I understand. But if at the end of the ﬁrst period less than 40 tickets are
sold, then we have overestimated the demand here. Since we have more
capacity left to be sold in the second as well as in the third period we can
expect that we have to lower the prices p2 as well as p3, don’t we?
I suppose so. But let’s test what happens. We can assume that at the end of
period 1, we have sold only 30 tickets instead of 40 tickets. We now have
to distribute 70 tickets over the remaining periods 2 and 3 using the
iterative procedure introduced in Sect. 17.5.3.2. We can see the results in
Table 17.9: Iterative distribution of the 70 tickets over second and third
period (overestimation of demand in the ﬁrst period). We assign now q2 ¼
30 tickets to the second period and q3 ¼ 40 tickets to the third period. If we
apply the DPFs then we get the updated sales prices p2 ¼ g2(30)¼100 € as
well as p3 ¼ g3(40) ¼ 87.50 €.
In the ﬁrst period we have earned 2700.00 €. Without the adaptation of the
prices we would have gained 26  113.33 € ¼ 2946.58 € in period 2, but
34  100.63 € in period 3. Overall, the updated revenue over all three
periods is 9068 €. Applying the updated prices in the second and the third
period we expect to gain 2700 € + 3000 € + 3500 € ¼ 9200 €. The
adaptation of the prices in response to the unexpected low demand in
period 1 partially compensates the revenue loss from the ﬁrst period in
the two remaining periods.
That’s true. Let’s see what happens if we underestimate demand in the ﬁrst
period. If we actually sell 50 tickets instead of 40 then we have scarceness
in the two remaining periods or at least in the last period. If we distribute
the 50 remaining tickets one after another over the two remaining periods
we will assign 22 tickets to period 2 but 28 tickets to period
3 (Table 17.10). The associated ticket prices in the two last periods are

Tjark:

p2 ¼ g2(22) ¼ 126.67 € resp. p3 ¼ g3(28) ¼ 113.75 €. Is there a ﬁnancial
beneﬁt from the price adaptation?
Yes. We have gained a revenue sum of 50  90 € ¼ 4500 € in period
1. Without the adjustments of capacities and prices we would get a run out
situation in period 3. From period 2 we earn 26  113.33 € ¼ 2946.58 €,
but in the third period we could sell only 24  100.63 ¼ 2415.12 €. The
total sum of revenue without price adaptation would be 4500 € + 2946.58 €
+ 2415.12 € ¼ 9861.70. After the adaptation we can earn 4500 € + 22 
126.67 € + 28  113.75 € ¼ 10,471.74 €. We were unable to achieve this
sum in our initial pricing since the used DPF g1 is g1(50) ¼ 75. Here, the
price update after period 1 enables us to deal better with this unexpected
scenario.

The resulting prices obtained in the rolling horizon application of the pricing
heuristic during the transition from period 1 to period 3 are summarized in
Fig. 17.22. The continuous line shows the proactively determined prices which
should be applied if the estimated demand is actually observed after a sales period
has ended. If the actual realized demand in period p remains below the forecasted

Fig. 17.22 Dynamic Pricing results after replanning between period 1 as well as 2

demand, i.e. if the demand arising in this period has been overestimated before
period 1, then prices in the subsequent periods must be lowered (dashed line). If the
actual demand in the ﬁrst period exceeds the estimated demand for this period then
we encounter a situation in which the residual capacity is too low to fulﬁll the
quantity assigned to the two remaining capacities. Here, re-pricing leads to increased
prices to reduce the offered capacity (dotted line).

17.5.4 Summary of Dynamic Pricing
We have introduced a multi-period pricing problem in which the overall resource
quantity must be distributed over the available sales period. The overall sales period
is partitioned into a ﬁnite number of sub-periods and it must be decided how much
will be offered in each sub-period. The application of the demand-price-function
calculates appropriate prices for the product or service considered in each
sub-period. To overcome shortcomings resulting from demand forecast errors, prices
can be updated between adjacent sub-periods if the end of a sub-period has been
reached. As a result, prices for a product or service may be updated unpredictably as
well as be demand-driven over time: this is called Dynamic Pricing (“rolling horizon
pricing”). The capacity distribution task is represented as a mathematical optimization model. It is nonlinear and so complex that an out-of-the-box-solver is unable to
reliably identify appropriate prices. Therefore, we have investigated a heuristic to
determine contingents for each sub-period which feed the demand-price-functions
used to determine period-speciﬁc sales prices. This procedure is also applied in a
rolling horizon framework to adjust prices to actual demand.

Pricing Lessons Learned and Open Issues

Pricing Lessons Learned and Open Issues

The central component of every demand-oriented pricing approach is the pricedemand function (PDF) that maps the price (rate) for a product to the demand for the
priced product. Also, its “inverse”, the demand-price-function, can be used to couple
prices with demand. An “optimal” price induces a maximal sum of earned revenues
by deploying at least one resource. If this capacity is not scarce and the revenue
function is differentiable, then this optimal price can be identiﬁed by differential
calculus techniques (Sect. 17.2). If the available capacity is scarce, it becomes
necessary to identify which customer or product uses the available resource capacity
is the most effective way. For this purpose, the pricing decision task has to be
represented by a mathematical optimization model in which the prices are the
decision variables to be ﬁxed. This model is solved by an adequate model solving
software. The returned set of optimal prices represents the best decision for when
several customers compete for resource utilization (Sect. 17.3). Network pricing
addresses pricing decisions if more than one scarce resource is available and
deployed for the realization of products (Sect. 17.4). Again, the determination of
optimal prices for the products offered requires the speciﬁcation and solving of a
mathematical decision model. If the price-demand-function can only be estimated,
then it becomes necessary to adjust prices in response to an observed market
behavior. This is called Dynamic Pricing and represents a reactively repeated
decision task to be solved (Sect. 17.5).
Although we have seen that the model-based pricing approaches discussed can be
used to determine revenue maximal prices, it is necessary to understand under which
circumstances these pricing approaches can be applied. Of course, it is necessary that
the PDF/DPF is available. However, the market situation also has to be checked. If
there is competition in the market considered then impacts of price variations can be
boosted or moderated if the other market participants follow their own goal to
acquire and attract as much market demand as possible. Therefore, some textbooks
and articles assume that the considered service provider/producer has a strong
market position, as in a monopolistic market setup.
Pricing is only the ﬁrst step at the beginning of a sales (sub)period to maximize
the revenues by treating different customers individually. RM provides additional
techniques for skimming the complete customer surplus. During the sales period,
customers with different willingness-to-pay are encountered. In this case, it is
necessary that the capacity provider evaluates each customer’s request individually.
If the willingness-to-pay is less than a least price (“bid price”), the provider must
refuse to fulﬁll this request: it is rejected. This technique is called capacity control
(Petrick et al. 2010). Customers whose requests have been accepted and who have
already paid sometimes do not use the capacity reserved due to short-term
cancellations and no-shows. The unused capacity cannot be ﬁlled up 100% again
since the sales period is already closed. To avoid a situation where scarce and
perishable capacity remains unused, more than 100% of the capacity is sold during
the sales period with the goal of ensuring complete capacity usage even if no-shows
appear. This RM-technique is called overbooking (McGill and van Ryzin 1999).
