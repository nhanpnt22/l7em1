                                            opening page of each chapter; the model is enhanced to accent the process of strategic
                                            planning being fluid rather than merely a sequence of silo activities.

                  place romance, hiring away rival firms’ employees, wildlife welfare, and sustainability. This text
                  reveals why “good ethics is good business” and why this is a strategic issue. The sustainability
                  discussion is improved to promote and encourage firms to conduct operations with respect for
                  the environment, an important concern for consumers, companies, society, and AACSB.

               etc. created by the author. Each video is associated with multiple-choice questions to help students
               assess their learning.

               Solving Teaching and Learning Challenges
                The primary challenge facing strategy professors is to keep students engaged while m           ­ aking sure
                business skills are learned. This text leads all others in being practical, skills-­oriented, and ­unfolding
                in the same manner as the process of actually doing strategic planning ­unfolds. ­Students and pro-
                fessors alike appreciate this practical approach presented in a concise, conversational, and exciting
                manner—­beginning with the integrative model of the ­strategic-management process that unifies all
               ­chapters. All of the 11 end-of-­chapter Mini-­Cases, 471 Review Questions, and 62 Assurance-of-
               Learning Exercises are designed s­ pecifically to apply chapter concepts.

               The Case Rationale
               Case analysis remains the primary learning vehicle used in most strategic-management classes,
               for five important reasons:
                   1. A
                       nalyzing cases gives students the opportunity to work in teams to evaluate the internal operations

                                                    This MyLab assessment includes 25 multiple-choice questions for each case, comprising
                                               10 Basic questions that simply test whether the student read the case before class, and 15 ­Applied
                                               questions that test the student’s ability to apply various strategic-management concepts. The 15
                                               Applied questions are presented in three sets of five that pertain to key concepts of particular
                                               importance for the respective case. This testing feature enables professors to determine, before
                                               class if desired, whether students (1) read the case in Basic terms, and/or (2) are able to Apply
                                               strategy concepts to resolve issues in the case. For example, the MyLab case Basic question may
                                               be: In what country is Domino’s Pizza headquartered? Whereas a MyLab case Applied question
                                               may be: What are three aspects of the organizational chart given in the Domino’s Pizza case that
                                               violate strategic-management guidelines?

               The David Approach Is Unique
               This textbook is globally considered to be the most practical, skills-oriented strategic manage-
               ment textbook on the market. All chapters unfold from a widely used integrative model of strate-

               seminal theories in strategy. The David approach is “learning by doing”—students develop skills
               that can enhance their own employability through numerous features, such as 62 new Assurance-

                                      Developing Employability Skills
                                      Using this text, students learn how to actually do strategic planning—this is a huge employability
                                      skill because employers recognize the benefits of employees having an understanding of what a
                                      firm is trying to achieve and why. Nearly all students using this text also use the free strategic-
                                      planning template at the www.strategyclub.com author website; many students include this skill
                                      on their resume to showcase their experience using this Excel software commonly used by busi-
                                      nesses for doing actual strategic planning.

                                                     tive model of the strategic-management process (illustrated in Figure 1-1), and defines
                                                     basic activities and terms in strategic management. The primary focus of this textbook

                                 LO 1.1     What Is Strategic Management?
                                            Strategic management is the art and science of formulating, implementing, and evaluating
                                            cross-functional decisions that enable an organization to achieve its objectives. As this definition
                                            implies, strategic management focuses on integrating management, marketing, finance, account-
                                            ing, production, and information systems to achieve organizational success. Strategic manage-
                                            ment can also be defined as the executive-level activity of distributing resources across products
                                            and regions to gain a sustainable competitive advantage over rivals.
                                                  Firms have liberty to compete many different ways in a variety of geographic areas, so deci-
                                            sions must be made regarding what markets to enter, what markets to avoid, which competitor’s
                                            space to invade, and which to avoid. A firm’s survival can hinge on these decisions being right;
                                            this textbook unveils the process needed for making effective strategic decisions. For example,
                                            Westinghouse Electric’s recent strategy to build a new generation of nuclear power plants was
                                            ill formulated and thus resulted in bankruptcy and eventual acquisition (in 2018) by Canada’s
                                            Brookfield Business Partners LP.

    The legendary football coach of the Green Bay Packers, Vince Lombardi
    (1913–1970) changed a losing culture into a winning culture. Founded
    in 1919 and headquartered in the small, frigid Wisconsin town of Green
    Bay, the Packers are the only nonprofit, community-owned major league
    professional sports team in the United States. The third-oldest franchise
    in the National Football League (NFL), the Packers were perennial losers
    until Vince Lombardi took over in 1959 as head coach and general man-
    ager. The very existence of the Packer franchise was in jeopardy when
                                                                                                                                  Stock Photo




    Lombardi arrived in Green Bay. Coming off a 1–10–1 season and 11
    straight losing seasons, Lombardi led the Packers to 3 NFL champion-
    ships in his first 7 seasons. The Pro Football Hall of Fame says: “Lombardi

                    Formulating strategies such as deciding what to produce and where, when, and how to
               compete is what leads to a sustainable competitive advantage. Even the best strategies must
               be implemented well through operational- or tactical-level activities like hiring and motivating
               employees, cutting costs, benchmarking, outsourcing, securing financing, and keeping facilities
               warm (or cool). Implementation activities are vitally important and must be monitored by strate-
               gists, but effectively formulated strategies, more so than operational tactics, is generally what
               leads to sustained competitive advantages.
                    To gain a sustainable competitive advantage, firms need to provide unique products and
               services. Uniqueness matters. For example, Apple’s computers, iPads, and iPhones all run on
               Apple’s unique operating system; the only way to have an iPhone is to also be a user of Apple’s
               operating system. To assure “effective uniqueness,” firms must accept concessions in the strategy
               process to gain a sustainable competitive as exemplified in the Apple example. Another example
               is Rolex, and the company not offering cheaper lines of watches. Rolex has resisted increasing
               market share by offering new cheaper product lines to attract new customers. Instead, Rolex has
               maintained its unique reputation and market share as the top luxury watch brand in the world.
               Rolex, and all successful firms, thus make tradeoffs and tough decisions throughout the process
               of developing, producing, and selling products.
                    Chapter 2 discusses core values, vision, and ­mission—items that represent the starting point
               for developing and nurturing a firm’s uniqueness. Everything in strategy flows from a particular
               firm’s core values, vision, and mission, and all successful firms are different (unique) from rival
               firms in some key ways.
                    The term strategic management is used at many colleges and universities as the title for the
               capstone course in business administration. This course integrates material from all business
               courses, and in addition, introduces new strategic-management concepts and techniques being
               widely used by firms. Two special features of this text are a Cohesion Case (on Coca-Cola) and
               end-of-chapter assurance-of-learning exercises, as described in Table 1-1.

               Strategic Planning
               The term strategic management in this text is used synonymously with the term strategic plan-
               ning. The latter term is more often used in the business world, whereas the former is often used
               in academia. Sometimes the term strategic management is used to refer to strategy formulation,

               TABLE 1-1 A Cohesion Case and Assurance-of-Learning Exercises
                   A distinguishing, popular feature of this text is the Cohesion Case, named so because a written case on
                   a company (Coca-Cola) appears at the end of this chapter, and then all other subsequent chapters feature
                   end-of-chapter assurance-of-learning exercises to apply strategic-planning concepts, tools, and techniques
                   to the Cohesion Case company. Coca-Cola is a well-known, well-managed global firm undergoing stra-
                   tegic change. By working through the Coca-Cola–related exercises, students become well prepared to
                   develop an effective strategic plan for any company (case) assigned to them. Case analysis is a core part
                   of almost every strategic-management course globally.
                         We are thrilled to provide new sets of end-of chapter assurance-of-learning exercises. All exercises
                   have been carefully designed to “assure learning” by applying chapter concepts, tools, and techniques
                   in a fun and meaningful way to best assure that competence is gained in particular employability skills
                   discussed near the end of this chapter. The four sets of assurance-of-learning exercises that appear at the
                   end of each chapter are as follows:
                   Set 1: Strategic Planning for Coca-Cola—Exercises that apply chapter material to the Coca-Cola Cohesion
                   Case Company; these exercises ready students for doing case analysis as “knowledge application and
                   analysis” and “information technology” skills are honed.
                   Set 2: Strategic Planning for My University—Exercises that apply chapter material to your college or
                   university; these exercises ready students for doing case analysis in nonprofit organizations as “business
                   ethics and social responsibility” and “data literacy” skills are honed.
                   Set 3: Strategic Planning to Enhance My Employability—Exercises that apply chapter material to in-
                   dividuals instead of companies; these exercises prepare students for making career choices and enable
                   students to apply strategy tools, techniques, and concepts to enhance their own career.
                   Set 4: Individual versus Group Strategic Planning—Exercises that apply chapter material by comparing the
                   effectiveness of individual versus group decisions; these are fun in-class group activities that yield “a winning
                   individual and a winning group” for each exercise as critical-thinking and collaboration skills are honed.

    34    PART 1 • OVERVIEW OF STRATEGIC MANAGEMENT

                                 implementation, and evaluation, with strategic planning referring only to strategy formulation.
                                 The purpose of strategic planning is to exploit and create new and different opportunities for
                                 tomorrow; long-range planning, in contrast, tries to optimize for tomorrow the trends of today.
                                      The term strategic planning originated in the 1950s and was popular between the mid-1960s
                                 and the mid-1970s. During these years, strategic planning was widely believed to be the answer
                                 for all problems. At the time, much of corporate America was “obsessed” with strategic plan-
                                 ning. Following that boom, however, strategic planning was cast aside during the 1980s as vari-
                                 ous planning models did not yield higher returns. The 1990s, however, brought the revival of
                                 strategic planning, and the process is widely practiced today in the business world.
                                      A strategic plan is, in essence, a company’s game plan. Just as an athletic team needs a good
                                 game plan to have a chance for success, a company must have a good strategic plan to compete
                                 successfully. Profit margins among firms in most industries are so slim that there is little room
                                 for error in the overall strategic plan. A strategic plan results from tough managerial choices
                                 among numerous good alternatives, and it signals commitment to specific markets, policies, pro-
                                 cedures, and operations in lieu of other, “less desirable” courses of action.

                                 The Strategic-Management Model
                                 The strategic-management model shown in Figure 1-1 is a widely accepted, comprehensive
                                 depiction of the strategic-management process.1 The process conveyed does not guarantee suc-
                                 cess, but it does represent a clear and practical approach for formulating, implementing, and
                                 evaluating strategies. Relationships among major components of the strategic-management pro-
                                 cess are shown in the model, which appears on the opening page of all subsequent chapters with
                                 appropriate area of the model shaded to show the particular focus of the chapter. This text is
                                 organized around the model because it reveals how organizations actually do strategic planning.
                                 There are three important questions to answer in preparing a strategic plan:
                                       Where are we now?
                                       Where do we want to go?
                                       How are we going to get there?

                                      Identifying an organization’s existing vision, mission, objectives, and strategies is the logi-
                                 cal starting point for strategic management because a firm’s present situation and condition may
                                 preclude certain strategies and may even dictate a particular course of action. Every organiza-
                                 tion has a vision, mission, objectives, and strategy, even if these elements are not consciously
                                 designed, written, or communicated. The answer to where an organization is going can be deter-
                                 mined largely by where the organization has been!
                                      The strategic-management process is dynamic and continuous. A change in any one of the
                                 major components in the model can necessitate a change in any or all of the other components.
                                 For instance, various third-world countries coming online could represent a major opportunity
                                 and require a change in long-term objectives and strategies; a failure to accomplish annual objec-
                                 tives might require a change in policy; or a major competitor’s change in strategy might require
                                 a change in the firm’s mission. The activities represented in Figure 1-1 are not independent silos;
                                 they represent an interrelated process. Thus, activities for strategy formulation, implementation,
                                 and evaluation should be performed on a continual basis, not just at the end of the year or semi-
                                 annually. The strategic-management process never really ends.
                                      In Figure 1-1, perhaps the most important “activity” is the feedback loop because strategy
                                 must be thought of as a “verb rather than a noun.” The stages of strategic management (formula-
                                 tion, implementation, and evaluation) are so fluid as to be virtually indistinguishable when one
                                 starts and the other ends. Continuous feedback enables firms to readily adapt to changing condi-
                                 tions; when anyone is preparing an external or internal assessment or even implementing strategies,
                                 they should be mindful of the firm’s vision and mission. The feedback loop reveals that a change
                                 in any strategic-planning activity can impact any or all other activities. For example, changes in
                                 a firm’s mission can impact all other activities; everything a firm does should be mission driven.
                                      Note in Figure 1-1 that business ethics, social responsibility, environmental sustainability,
                                 and international issues impact all activities in the model, as discussed in Chapters 10 and 11,
                                 respectively. Regarding business ethics, recent research revealed in the Ethics Capsule 1 con-
                                 cludes that “trustworthiness” is the most important variable in doing business.

                     The strategic-management process is not as cleanly divided and neatly performed in practice
               as the strategic-management model suggests. Strategists do not go through the process in lock-
               step fashion. Generally, there is give-and-take among hierarchical levels of an organization. To
               develop a strategic plan, many organizations conduct formal meetings semiannually to discuss
               and update the firm’s vision, mission, opportunities, threats, strengths, weaknesses, strategies,
               objectives, policies, and performance. These meetings are commonly held off premises and are
               called retreats. The rationale for periodically conducting strategic-management meetings away
               from the work site is to encourage more creativity and candor from participants. Good communi-
               cation and feedback are needed throughout the strategic-management process.
                     Application of the strategic-management process is typically more formal in larger and well-
               established organizations. Formality refers to the extent that participants, responsibilities, author-
               ity, duties, and “basic approach” are objective and clear rather than subjective and vague. Smaller
               businesses tend to be less formal. Firms that compete in complex, rapidly changing environ-
               ments, such as technology companies, tend to be more formal in strategic planning. Firms that
               have many divisions, products, markets, and technologies also tend to be more formal in apply-
               ing strategic-management concepts. Greater formality in applying the strategic-management
               process is usually positively associated with organizational success.2


               Stages of Strategic Management                                                                                                      LO 1.2
               The strategic-management process consists of three stages: strategy formulation, strategy
               implementation, and strategy evaluation. Strategy formulation includes developing a vision and
               mission, identifying an organization’s external opportunities and threats, determining internal
               strengths and weaknesses, establishing long-term objectives, generating alternative strategies,
               and choosing particular strategies to pursue. Strategy-formulation issues include deciding what
               new businesses to enter, what businesses to abandon, whether to expand operations or diversify,
               whether to enter international markets, whether to merge or form a joint venture, and how to
               avoid a hostile takeover.

    36    PART 1 • OVERVIEW OF STRATEGIC MANAGEMENT

                                               Because no organization has unlimited resources, strategists must decide which alterna-
                                          tive strategies will benefit the firm most. Strategy-formulation decisions commit an organiza-
                                          tion to specific products, markets, resources, and technologies over an extended period of time.
                                          Strategies determine long-term competitive advantages. For better or worse, strategic decisions
                                          have major multifunctional consequences and enduring effects on an organization. Top managers
                                          have the best perspective to understand fully the ramifications of strategy-formulation decisions;
                                          they have the authority to commit the resources necessary for implementation.
                                               Strategy implementation requires a firm to establish annual objectives, devise policies,
                                          motivate employees, and allocate resources so that formulated strategies can be executed effi-
                                          ciently. Strategy implementation includes developing a strategy-supportive culture, creating an
                                          organizational structure, redirecting marketing efforts, preparing budgets, developing and using
                                          information systems, devising tactics, and linking employee compensation to organizational
                                          performance.
                                               Strategy implementation often is called the “action stage” of strategic management.
                                          Implementing strategy means mobilizing employees and managers to put formulated strategies
                                          into action. Often considered to be the most difficult stage in strategic management, strategy
                                          implementation requires personal discipline, commitment, and sacrifice. Successful strategy
                                          implementation hinges on managers’ ability to motivate employees, which is more an art than a
                                          science. Strategies formulated but not implemented serve no useful purpose.
                                               Interpersonal skills are especially critical for successful strategy implementation. Strategy-
                                          implementation activities affect all employees and managers in an organization. Every division
                                          and department must decide on answers to questions such as “What must we do to implement
                                          our part of the organization’s strategy?” and “How best can we get the job done?” The challenge
                                          of implementation is to stimulate managers and employees throughout an organization to work
                                          with pride and enthusiasm toward achieving stated objectives.
                                               Strategy evaluation is the final stage in strategic management. Managers desperately need
                                          to know when particular strategies are not working well; strategy evaluation is the primary means
                                          for obtaining this information. All strategies are subject to future modification because external
                                          and internal factors constantly change. Three fundamental strategy-evaluation activities are (1)
                                          reviewing external and internal factors that are the bases for current strategies, (2) measuring
                                          performance, and (3) taking corrective actions. Strategy evaluation is needed because success
                                          today is no guarantee of success tomorrow! Success always creates new and different problems;
                                          complacent organizations experience demise.
                                               Formulation, implementation, and evaluation of strategy activities occur at three hierarchi-
                                          cal levels in a large organization: corporate, divisional or strategic business unit, and functional.
                                          By fostering communication and interaction among managers and employees across hierarchical
                                          levels, strategic management helps a firm function as a competitive team. Most small businesses
                                          and some large businesses do not have divisions or strategic business units; they have only the
                                          corporate and functional levels. Nevertheless, managers and employees at these two levels should
                                          be actively involved in strategic-management activities.
                                               Peter Drucker says the prime task of strategic management is thinking through the overall
                                          mission of a business—

                                             that is, of asking the question, “What is our business?” This leads to the setting of objec-
                                             tives, the development of strategies, and the making of today’s decisions for tomorrow’s
                                             results. This clearly must be done by a part of the organization that can see the entire busi-
                                             ness; that can balance objectives and the needs of today against the needs of tomorrow; and
                                             that can allocate resources of men and money to key results.3


                                 LO 1.3   Integrating Analysis and Intuition
                                          Edward Deming once said, “In God we trust. All others bring data.” The ­strategic-management
                                          process can be described as an objective, logical, systematic approach for making major
                                          decisions in an organization. It attempts to organize qualitative and quantitative informa-
                                          tion in a way that allows effective decisions to be made under conditions of uncertainty. Yet
                                          strategic management is not a pure science that lends itself to a nice, neat, one-two-three
                                          approach.

                     Based on past experiences, judgment, and feelings, most people recognize that intuition
               is essential to making good strategic decisions. Some managers and owners of businesses pro-
               fess to have extraordinary abilities for using intuition alone in devising brilliant strategies. For
               example, Will Durant, who organized General Motors (GM), was described by Alfred Sloan as
               “a man who would proceed on a course of action guided solely, as far as I could tell, by some
               intuitive flash of brilliance. He never felt obliged to make an engineering hunt for the facts. Yet at
               times, he was astoundingly correct in his judgment.”4 Albert Einstein acknowledged the impor-
               tance of intuition when he said, “I believe in intuition and inspiration. At times I feel certain that
               I am right while not knowing the reason. Imagination is more important than knowledge because
               knowledge is limited, whereas imagination embraces the entire world.”5
                     Although some organizations today may survive and prosper because they have intuitive
               geniuses managing them, most are not so fortunate. Most organizations can benefit from inte-
               grating intuition and analysis in decision making. Choosing an intuitive or analytic approach to
               decision making is not an either–or proposition. Managers at all levels in an organization inject
               their intuition and judgment into strategic-management analyses. Analytical thinking and intui-
               tive thinking complement each other.
                     Operating from the I’ve-already-made-up-my-mind-don’t-bother-me-with-the-facts mode is
               not management by intuition; it is management by ignorance.6 Drucker says, “I believe in intu-
               ition only if you discipline it. ‘Hunch’ artists, who make a diagnosis but don’t check it out with
               the facts, are the ones in medicine who kill people, and in management kill businesses.”7 In a
               sense, the strategic-management process is an attempt to duplicate what goes on in the mind of a
               brilliant, intuitive person who knows the business and assimilates and integrates that knowledge
               through analysis in formulating strategies.
                     As Henderson notes:

                   The accelerating rate of change today is producing a business world in which custom-
                   ary managerial habits in organizations are increasingly inadequate. Experience alone was
                   an adequate guide when changes could be made in small increments. But intuitive and
                   ­experience-based management philosophies are grossly inadequate when decisions are
                    strategic and have major, irreversible consequences.8

               Adapting to Change
               The strategic-management process is based on the belief that organizations should continually
               monitor internal and external events and trends so that timely changes can be made as needed.
               The rate and magnitude of changes that affect organizations are increasing dramatically, as evi-
               denced by how the drop in oil prices caught so many firms by surprise. Firms, like organisms,
               must be “adept at adapting” or they will not survive.
                    To survive, all organizations must astutely identify and adapt to change, as the Chinese Mobike
               Company does as revealed in the Global Capsule 1 on page 38. The strategic-management process
               is aimed at allowing organizations to adapt effectively to change over the long run. Waterman noted:

                   In today’s business environment, more than in any preceding era, the only constant is
                   change. Successful organizations effectively manage change, continuously adapting their
                   bureaucracies, strategies, systems, products, and cultures to survive the shocks and prosper
                   from the forces that decimate the competition.9

                    The need to adapt to change leads organizations to key strategic-management questions,
               such as “What kind of business should we become?” “Are we in the right field(s)?” “Should
               we reshape our business?” “What new competitors are entering our industry?” “What strate-
               gies should we pursue?” “How are our customers changing?”; and “Are new technologies being
               developed that could put us out of business?”
                    Online commerce is forcing hundreds of brick-and-mortar retailers to change or liquidate.
               The fashion retailer Bebe Stores recently announced it is closing all its 168 stores and going
               online only. Yarden Research reports that 29.1 percent of retail sales of general merchandise,
               apparel and accessories, and furniture in America is now purchased online. Companies such
               as Macy’s and Target are converting more and more of their retail store space to warehouse/­
               distribution area rather than being open for customer shopping.

                                 LO 1.4   Key Terms in Strategic Management
                                          Before we further discuss strategic management, we should define ten key terms: competitive
                                          advantage, strategists, vision and mission statements, external opportunities and threats, inter-
                                          nal strengths and weaknesses, long-term objectives, strategies, annual objectives, and policies.

                                          Competitive Advantage
                                          Strategic management is all about gaining and maintaining competitive advantage. This term
                                          can be defined as any activity a firm does especially well compared with activities done by
                                          rival firms, or any resource a firm possesses that rival firms desire. For example, having fewer
                                          fixed assets than rival firms can provide major competitive advantages. Apple Inc. has virtually
                                          no manufacturing facilities of its own, whereas rival Sony owns 57 electronics factories. Apple
                                          relies almost entirely on contract manufacturers for production of its products.
                                               Normally, a firm can sustain a competitive advantage for only a certain period because of rival
                                          firms imitating and undermining that advantage. Thus, it is not adequate simply to obtain competitive
                                          advantage. A firm must strive to achieve sustained competitive advantage by doing the following:
                                            1. Continually adapting to changes in external trends and events and internal capabilities,
                                               competencies, and resources.
                                            2. Effectively formulating, implementing, and evaluating strategies that capitalize on those factors.
                                            3. Offering products that are unique and not easily duplicated by rivals.
                                            4. Accepting tradeoffs by deciding what not to do; no firm can be everything to everybody.


                                          Strategists
                                          Strategists are the individuals most responsible for the success or failure of an organization. They
                                          have various job titles, such as chief executive officer, chief strategy officer, president, owner,
                                          chair of the board, executive director, chancellor, dean, and entrepreneur. Jay Conger, professor
                                          of organizational behavior at the London Business School and author of Building Leaders, says,
                                          “All strategists have to be chief learning officers. We are in an extended period of change. If our

               leaders aren’t highly adaptive and great models during this period, then our companies won’t
               adapt either, because ultimately leadership is about being a role model.”
                     Strategists help an organization gather, analyze, and organize information. They track indus-
               try and competitive trends, develop forecasting models and scenario analyses, evaluate corporate
               and divisional performance, spot emerging market opportunities, identify business threats, and
               develop creative action plans. Strategic planners usually serve in a support or staff role. Usually
               found in higher levels of management, they typically have considerable authority for decision
               making in the firm. The CEO is the most visible and critical strategic manager. Any manager
               who has responsibility for a unit or division, responsibility for profit and loss outcomes, or direct
               authority over a major piece of the business is a strategic manager (strategist).
                     The chief strategy officer (CSO) position has become common in many organizations. Hundreds
               of companies have appointed a new chief strategy officer in the last couple of years, including Talon
               International, TeleTech, Fleet Complete, Ringler Associates, LRES, Amber Engine, Beaver-Visitec
               International, Momentum Worldwide, PGi, TIA, World Surf League, Bank of Hawaii, Snapdeal,
               Oramed, Saatva, Centrillion, Geisinger Health System, and Amplifi Commerce.
                     Strategists differ as much as organizations do, and these differences must be considered
               in the formulation, implementation, and evaluation of strategies. Strategists differ in their atti-
               tudes, values, ethics, willingness to take risks, concern for social responsibility, concern for
               profitability, concern for short-run versus long-run aims, and management style; some will not
               even consider various types of strategies because of their personal philosophies. The founder of
               Hershey, Milton Hershey, built the company so that he could afford to manage an orphanage.
               From corporate profits, Hershey today cares for about 850 boys and 950 girls in its boarding
               school for pre-K through grade 12.
                     Athletic coaches are also strategists. Football, basketball, baseball, soccer, and in fact many ath-
               letic contests are often won or lost based on a team’s game plan. For example, a basketball coach may
               plan to fast break and play up-tempo, rather than play more half-court, if the players are smaller and
               faster, or if the team has more depth than the opposing team. Some inspirational, strategic-planning-
               related quotes from legendary National Football League (NFL) coaches are provided in Table 1-2.

               Vision and Mission Statements
               Many organizations today develop a vision statement that answers the question “What do we
               want to become?” Developing a vision statement is often considered the first step in strategic
               planning, preceding even development of a mission statement. Many vision statements are a
               single sentence as revealed through numerous examples in Chapter 2.

    40    PART 1 • OVERVIEW OF STRATEGIC MANAGEMENT

                                      A mission statement is an “enduring statement of purpose that distinguishes one busi-
                                 ness from other similar firms. A mission statement identifies the scope of a firm’s opera-
                                 tions in product and market terms.”10 It addresses the basic question that faces all strategists:
                                 “What is our business?” A clear mission statement describes the values and priorities of an
                                 organization. Developing a mission statement compels strategists to think about the nature
                                 and scope of present operations and to assess the potential attractiveness of future markets
                                 and activities. A mission statement broadly charts the future direction of an organization and
                                 serves as a constant reminder to its employees of why the organization exists and what the
                                 founders envisioned when they put their fame and fortune (and names) at risk to breathe life
                                 into their dreams.

                                 External Opportunities and Threats
                                 External opportunities and external threats refer to economic, social, cultural, demographic,
                                 environmental, political, legal, governmental, technological, and competitive trends and events
                                 that could significantly benefit or harm an organization in the future. Opportunities and threats
                                 are largely beyond the control of a single organization, thus, the word external. Some general
                                 categories of opportunities and threats are listed in Table 1-3. Dollars, numbers, percentages,
                                 ratios, and quantification are essential so strategists can assess the magnitude of opportunities and
                                 threats and take appropriate actions. For example, in Table 1-3, rather than saying “Marketing is
                                 moving rapidly to the Internet,” strategists need to conduct research and find, for example, that
                                 “spending on online advertisements globally is rising 18 percent annually and represents about
                                 44 percent of total advertising spending in the USA.” Strategies must be formulated and imple-
                                 mented based on specific factual information to the extent possible because so much is at stake
                                 in having a good game plan.
                                      External trends and events are creating a different type of consumer and consequently a
                                 need for different types of products, services, and strategies. A competitor’s strength could be a
                                 threat, or a rival firm’s weakness could be an opportunity. A basic tenet of strategic management
                                 is that firms need to formulate strategies to take advantage of external opportunities and avoid
                                 or reduce the impact of external threats. For this reason, identifying, monitoring, and evaluating
                                 external opportunities and threats are essential for success. This process of conducting research
                                 and gathering and assimilating external information is sometimes called environmental scanning
                                 or industry analysis. Lobbying is one activity that some organizations use to influence external
                                 opportunities and threats.

                                 Internal strengths and internal weaknesses are an organization’s controllable activities that
                                 are performed especially well or poorly. They arise in the activities of management, market-
                                 ing, finance/accounting, production, and information systems of a business. Identifying and

               evaluating organizational strengths and weaknesses in the functional areas of a business is an
               essential strategic-management activity. Organizations strive to pursue strategies that capitalize
               on internal strengths and improve internal weaknesses.
                    Strengths and weaknesses are determined relative to competitors. Relative deficiency or supe-
               riority is important information. Also, strengths and weaknesses can be determined by elements of
               being rather than performance. For example, a strength may involve ownership of natural resources
               or a historic reputation for quality. Strengths and weaknesses may be determined relative to a firm’s
               own objectives. For instance, high levels of inventory turnover may not be a strength for a firm that
               seeks never to stock-out.
                    In performing a strategic-management case analysis, it is important to be as divisional
               as possible when determining and stating internal strengths and weaknesses. In other words,
               for a company such as Walmart, saying, “Sam Club’s revenues grew 11 percent in the recent
               quarter,” is far better than saying “Walmart’s revenues grew 6 percent in the recent quarter.”
               Being divisional enables strategies to be more effectively formulated and targeted. This is
               important because all firms must allocate resources across divisions (segments) of the firm
               (that is, by product, region, customer, or whatever the various units of the firm are), such as
               Walmart’s Sam’s Club compared with Walmart Supercenters, Walmart Mexico, or Walmart
               Europe.
                    Both internal and external factors should be stated as specifically as possible, using numbers,
               percentages, dollars, and ratios, as well as comparisons over time to rival firms. Quantification is
               important because strategies will be formulated and resources allocated based on this informa-
               tion. The more specific the underlying external and internal factors, the more effectively strategies
               can be formulated and resources allocated. Determining the numbers takes more time, but survival
               of the firm often is at stake, so doing some research and incorporating numbers associated with
               key factors is essential.
                    Internal factors can be determined in a number of ways, including computing ratios, measur-
               ing performance, and comparing to past periods and industry averages. Various types of surveys
               also can be developed and administered to examine internal factors, such as employee morale,
               production efficiency, advertising effectiveness, and customer loyalty.

               Long-Term Objectives
               Objectives can be defined as specific results that an organization seeks to achieve in pursuing
               its mission. Long term means more than one year. Objectives are essential for organizational
               success because they provide direction; aid in evaluation; foster synergy; reveal priorities;
               focus coordination; and provide a basis for effective planning, organizing, motivating, and
               controlling activities. Objectives should be challenging, measurable, consistent, reasonable,
               and clear. In a multidimensional firm, objectives are needed both for the overall company and
               each division.
                    Headquartered in New York City, Foot Locker, Inc. recently posted the following long-term
               objectives on its corporate website (paraphrased):
                   1.   Annual revenues: $7.5 billion
                   2.   Annual revenues per square foot: $500
                   3.   EBIT margin: 11 percent
                   4.   Profit margin: 7 percent
                   5.   Return on invested capital: 14 percent
                   6.   Inventory turnover: 3+ times
                    In contrast, Macy’s, Inc.’s Annual Report lists as objectives to “to grow sales profitably” and
               “to maximize total shareholder return.” Avoid vagueness like this throughout a strategic-planning
               project!

               Strategies
               Strategies are the means by which long-term objectives will be achieved. Business strategies
               may include geographic expansion, diversification, acquisition, product development, market
               penetration, retrenchment, divestiture, liquidation, and joint venture. Strategies are potential
               actions that require top-management decisions and significant amounts of the firm’s resources.

                                 They affect an organization’s long-term prosperity, typically for at least five years, and thus
                                 are future oriented. Strategies also have multifunctional and multidivisional consequences and
                                 require consideration of both the external and internal factors facing the firm.
                                      Strategies currently being pursued by Amazon are described in Table 1-4.


                                 TABLE 1-4 Amazon’s Strategies
                                  The world’s largest bookseller, Amazon, is surprisingly embracing the brick-and-mortar bookstore retail
                                  format it’s been killing for 20 years. Amazon’s physical bookstore front fits with the company’s increas-
                                  ing reliance on storefronts including AmazonBooks, Amazon Go, and AmazonFresh Pickup to build
                                  sales and meet customers where they are. AmazonBooks now has more than 10 physical stores. Another
                                  reason for Amazon’s new strategy is that physical bookstores are experiencing something of a comeback.
                                  From 2010 to 2017, the number of independent bookstores increased by nearly 30 percent. These stores
                                  are capitalizing on a loyal customer base that appreciates the value of a real bookstore that hosts read-
                                  ings and events, offers conversation and discussion areas, and enables in-store browsing and discovery.
                                  Amazon also recently acquired the brick-and-mortar grocery store chain Whole Foods Market. Entire
                                  industries are being rocked or crushed by Amazon’s competitive size, scale, diversity, automation, and
                                  prowess.

                                 SWOT Analysis
                                 Strengths-Weaknesses-Opportunities-Threats (SWOT) Analysis is an important matching
                                 tool that helps managers develop four types of strategies: SO (strengths-opportunities) strate-
                                 gies, WO (weaknesses-opportunities) strategies, ST (strengths-threats) strategies, and WT
                                 ­(weaknesses-threats) strategies.11 Matching key external and internal factors is a critically impor-
                                  tant activity in strategic planning. Note in Table 1-5 that the resultant strategies 1, 2, 3, and 4 are
                                  SO, WO, ST, and WT strategies, respectively. SWOT analysis is explained further in Chapter 6,
                                  but the matching of external with internal factors to generate strategies results in a SWOT Matrix
                                  as illustrated in Figure 1-2.

                                 Annual Objectives
                                 Annual objectives are short-term milestones that organizations must achieve to reach long-
                                 term objectives. Like long-term objectives, annual objectives should be measurable, quan-
                                 titative, challenging, realistic, consistent, and prioritized. They must also be established at
                                 the corporate, divisional, and functional levels in a large organization. Annual objectives
                                 should be stated in terms of management, marketing, finance/accounting, and production
                                 accomplishments. A set of annual objectives is needed for each long-term objective. These

                                             objectives are especially important in strategy implementation, whereas long-term objectives
                                             are particularly important in strategy formulation. Annual objectives provide the basis for
                                             allocating resources.

                                             Policies
                                             Policies are the means by which annual objectives will be achieved. Policies include guide-
                                             lines, rules, and procedures established to support efforts to achieve stated objectives. Policies
                                             are guides to decision making and address repetitive or recurring situations. Usually, policies
                                             are stated in terms of management, marketing, finance/accounting, production/operations, R&D,
                                             and MIS activities. They may be established at the corporate level and apply to an entire orga-
                                             nization, at the divisional level and apply to a single division, or they may be established at the
                                             functional level and apply to particular operational activities or departments.
                                                  Like annual objectives, policies are especially important in strategy implementation because
                                             they outline an organization’s expectations of its employees and managers. Policies allow con-
                                             sistency and coordination within and between organizational departments. For example, IBM
                                             recently instituted a new policy requiring employees to work from an IBM office rather than work-
                                             ing remotely, reversing a 30-year policy. IBM had previously for decades boasted that more than
                                             40 percent of its employees worked remotely, but the company’s new policy is aimed at improving
                                             employee collaboration and accelerating the pace of work. The policy is also aimed at reversing
                                             IBM’s two consecutive quarters of declining revenue. Several large companies are following the
                                             IBM lead, recalling at-home employees, including Yahoo, Bank of America, and Aetna Inc.


                                 LO 1.5      Benefits of Engaging in Strategic Management
                                             Strategic management allows an organization to be more proactive than reactive in shaping its
                                             own future; it allows an organization to initiate and influence (rather than just respond to) activi-
                                             ties, and thus, to exert control over its own destiny. Small business owners, chief executive offi-
                                             cers, presidents, and managers of many for-profit and nonprofit organizations have recognized
                                             and realized the benefits of strategic management.
                                                   Historically, the principal benefit of strategic management has been to help organiza-
                                             tions formulate better strategies through the use of a more systematic, logical, and rational
                                             approach for decision making. In addition, the process, rather than the decision or document,
                                             is also a major benefit of engaging in strategic management. Through involvement in the
                                             process (i.e., dialogue and participation), managers and employees become committed to sup-
                                             porting the organization. A key to successful strategic management is communication, and
                                             it may be the most important word in all of management. Figure 1-3 illustrates this intrinsic
                                             benefit of a firm engaging in strategic planning; note that all firms need all employees “on a
                                             mission” to help the firm succeed.
                                                   Dale McConkey said, “Plans are less important than planning.” The manner in which strate-
                                             gic management is carried out is therefore exceptionally important. A major aim of the process

                                                                                       CHAPTER 1 • The Nature of Strategic Management    45


               is to achieve understanding and commitment from all managers and employees. Understanding
               may be the most important benefit of strategic management, followed by commitment. When
               managers and employees understand what the organization is doing and why, they often feel
               a part of the firm and become committed to assisting it. This is especially true when employ-
               ees also understand links between their own compensation and organizational performance.
               Managers and employees become surprisingly creative and innovative when they understand and
               support the firm’s mission, objectives, and strategies. A great benefit of strategic management,
               then, is the opportunity that the process provides to empower individuals. Empowerment is the
               act of strengthening employees’ sense of effectiveness by encouraging them to participate in
               decision making and to exercise initiative and imagination and rewarding them for doing so. You
               want your people to run the business as it if were their own.
                    Strategic planning is a learning, helping, educating, and supporting process, not merely a
               paper-shuffling activity among top executives. Strategic-management dialogue is more impor-
               tant than a nicely bound strategic-management document. A strategist must avoid developing
               a strategic plan alone and then present the plan to operating managers to execute. Through
               involvement in the process, line managers must become “owners” of the strategy. Ownership
               of a strategic plan by the people who have to execute the plan is a key to success in any
               organization.
                    Although making good strategic decisions is the major responsibility of an organization’s
               owner or chief executive officer, both managers and employees must also be involved in strategy
               formulation, implementation, and evaluation activities. Participation is a key to gaining com-
               mitment for needed changes. An increasing number of corporations and institutions are using
               strategic management to make effective decisions. But strategic management is not a guarantee
               for success; it can be dysfunctional if conducted haphazardly.


               Financial Benefits
               Organizations that use strategic-management concepts are generally more successful, showing
               significant improvement in sales, profitability, and productivity, compared to firms without sys-
               tematic planning activities. High-performing firms tend to do systematic planning to prepare for
               future fluctuations in their external and internal environments. Firms with management systems
               that use strategic-planning concepts, tools, and techniques generally exhibit superior long-term
               financial performance relative to their industry.
                    High-performing firms seem to make more informed decisions with good anticipation of
               both short- and long-term consequences. In contrast, firms that perform poorly often engage in
               activities that are shortsighted and do not reflect good forecasting of future conditions. Strategists
               of low-performing organizations are often preoccupied with solving internal problems and meet-
               ing paperwork deadlines. They typically underestimate their competitors’ strengths and overesti-
               mate their own firm’s strengths. They often attribute weak performance to uncontrollable factors
               such as a poor economy, technological change, or foreign competition.
                    More than 100,000 businesses in the United States fail annually. Business failures include
               bankruptcies, foreclosures, liquidations, and court-mandated receiverships. Although many
               factors besides a lack of effective strategic management can lead to business failure, the plan-
               ning concepts and tools described in this text can yield substantial financial benefits for any
               organization.

               Nonfinancial Benefits
               Besides helping firms avoid financial demise, strategic management offers other tangible
               benefits, such as enhanced awareness of external threats, improved understanding of com-
               petitors’ strategies, increased employee productivity, reduced resistance to change, and a
               clearer understanding of performance–reward relationships. Strategic management enhances
               the problem-prevention capabilities of organizations because it promotes interaction among
               managers at all divisional and functional levels. Firms that have nurtured their managers and
               employees, shared organizational objectives with them, empowered them to help improve the
               product or service, and recognized their contributions can turn to them for help in a pinch
               because of this interaction.

    46    PART 1 • OVERVIEW OF STRATEGIC MANAGEMENT

                                               In addition to empowering managers and employees, strategic management often brings
                                          order and discipline to an otherwise floundering firm. It can be the beginning of an efficient and
                                          effective managerial system. Strategic management may renew confidence in the current busi-
                                          ness strategy or point to the need for corrective actions. The strategic-management process pro-
                                          vides a basis for identifying and rationalizing the need for change to all managers and employees
                                          of a firm; it helps them view change as an opportunity rather than as a threat. Some nonfinancial
                                          benefits of a firm using strategic management are increased discipline, improved coordination,
                                          enhanced communication, increased forward thinking, improved decision making, increased
                                          synergy, and more effective allocation of time and resources.


                                 LO 1.6   Why Some Firms Do No Strategic Planning
                                          Some firms do not engage in formal strategic planning, and some firms do engage in strategic
                                          planning but receive little support from managers and employees. Ten reasons (excuses) often
                                          given for minimal or no strategic planning in a firm are as follows:
                                           1. No formal training in strategic management
                                           2. No understanding of or appreciation for the benefits of planning
                                           3. No monetary rewards for doing planning
                                           4. No punishment for not planning
                                           5. Too busy “firefighting” (resolving internal crises) to plan ahead
                                           6. View planning as a waste of time because no product/service is made
                                           7. Laziness; effective planning takes time and effort; time is money
                                           8. Content with current success; failure to realize that success today is no guarantee for suc-
                                              cess tomorrow;
                                           9. Overconfidence

                                          Strategic planning is an involved, intricate, and complex process that takes an organization into
                                          uncharted territory. It does not provide a ready-to-use prescription for success; instead, it takes the
                                          organization through a journey and offers a framework for addressing questions and solving prob-
                                          lems. Being aware of potential pitfalls and being prepared to address them is essential to success.
                                               There are some pitfalls in doing strategic planning; avoid the following:
                                           •    Using strategic planning to gain control over decisions and resources
                                           •    Doing strategic planning only to satisfy accreditation or regulatory requirements
                                           •    Too hastily moving from mission development to strategy formulation
                                           •    Not communicating the plan to employees, who continue working in the dark
                                           •    Top managers making many intuitive decisions that conflict with the formal plan
                                           •    Top managers not actively supporting the strategic-planning process
                                           •    Not using plans as a standard for measuring performance
                                           •    Delegating planning to a “planner” rather than involving all managers
                                           •    Not involving key employees in all phases of planning
                                           •    Not creating a collaborative climate supportive of change
                                           •    Viewing planning as unnecessary or unimportant
                                           •    Viewing planning activities as silos comprised of independent parts
                                           •    Becoming so engrossed in current problems that insufficient or no planning is done
                                           •    Being so formal in planning that flexibility and creativity are stifled12


                                 LO 1.8   Comparing Business and Military Strategies
                                          A strong military heritage underlies the study of strategic management. Terms such as objec-
                                          tives, mission, strengths, and weaknesses were first formulated to address problems on the
                                          battlefield. According to Webster’s New World Dictionary, strategy is “the science of planning

               and directing large-scale military operations, of maneuvering forces into the most advanta-
               geous position prior to actual engagement with the enemy.”13 The word strategy comes from
               the Greek strategos, which refers to a military general and combines stratos (the army) and
               agos (to lead). The history of strategic planning began in the military. A key aim of both busi-
               ness and military strategy is “to gain competitive advantage.” In many respects, business strat-
               egy is like military strategy, and military strategists have learned much over the centuries that
               can benefit business strategists today.
                    Both business and military organizations try to use their own strengths to exploit com-
               petitors’ weaknesses. If an organization’s overall strategy is wrong (ineffective), then all the
               efficiency in the world may not be enough to allow success. Business or military success
               is generally not the happy result of accidental strategies. Rather, success is the product of
               both continuous attention to changing external and internal conditions and the formulation
               and implementation of insightful adaptations to those conditions. The element of surprise
               provides great competitive advantages in both military and business strategy; information
               systems that provide data on opponents’ or competitors’ strategies and resources are also
               vitally important.
                    A fundamental difference between military and business strategy is that business strategy
               is formulated, implemented, and evaluated with an assumption of competition, whereas mili-
               tary strategy is based on an assumption of conflict. In a military setting there is generally one
               winner, but in business there are usually multiple winners. For example, several firms can win
               in the hamburger business; you do not have to confront McDonald’s head on, instead offer a
               different mix of burgers, restaurant design, and customer service and still be successful. This
               example explains competition and avoiding conflict with a larger player such as McDonald’s. In
               military situations, it is often impossible to avoid conflict with the larger army. Business strate-
               gists have access to valuable insights that military thinkers have refined over time. Superior
               strategy formulation and implementation can overcome an opponent’s superiority in numbers
               and resources.
                    Born in Pella in 356 bce, Alexander the Great was king of Macedon, a state in northern
               ancient Greece. Tutored by Aristotle until the age of 16, Alexander had created one of the largest
               empires of the ancient world by the age of thirty, stretching from the Ionian Sea to the Himalayas.
               Alexander was undefeated in battle and is considered one of history’s most successful command-
               ers. He became the measure against which military leaders even today compare themselves, and
               military academies throughout the world still teach his strategies and tactics. Alexander the Great
               once said, “Greater is an army of sheep led by a lion, than an army of lions led by a sheep.” This
               quote reveals the overwhelming importance of an excellent strategic plan for any organization
               to succeed.
                    Both business and military organizations must adapt to change and constantly improve
               to be successful. Too often, firms do not change their strategies when their environment and
               competitive conditions dictate the need to change. Gluck offered a classic military example
               of this:

                   When Napoleon won, it was because his opponents were committed to the strategy, tac-
                   tics, and organization of earlier wars. When he lost—against Wellington, the Russians,
                   and the Spaniards—it was because he, in turn, used tried-and-true strategies against en-
                   emies who thought afresh, who were developing the strategies not of the last war but of
                   the next.14

                    Sun Tzu’s The Art of War has been applied to many fields well outside of the military.
               Much of the text is about how to fight wars without actually having to do battle: It gives tips on
               how to outsmart one’s opponent so that physical battle is not necessary. As such, the book has
               found application as a training guide for many competitive endeavors that do not involve actual
               combat, such as in devising courtroom trial strategy or acquiring a rival company. Similarities
               can be construed from Sun Tzu’s writings to the practice of formulating and implementing
               strategies among businesses today. Table 1-6, on page 48, provides narrative excerpts from
               The Art of War; which of the principles listed do you believe are most applicable or analogous
               to companies as compared to armies?

    48    PART 1 • OVERVIEW OF STRATEGIC MANAGEMENT

                                          TABLE 1-6 Excerpts from Sun Tzu’s The Art of War Writings
                                           •   Strategic planning is a matter of vital importance to the state: a matter of life or death, the road either
                                               to survival or ruin. Hence, it is imperative that it be studied thoroughly.
                                           •   Strategic planning is based on deception. When near the enemy, make it seem that you are far away;
                                               when far away, make it seem that you are near. Hold out baits to lure the enemy. Strike the enemy
                                               when he is in disorder. Avoid the enemy when he is stronger. Attack the enemy where he is unpre-
                                               pared. Appear where you are not expected.
                                           •   A speedy victory is the main object in strategic planning. If this is long in coming, weapons are
                                               blunted and morale depressed. When the army engages in protracted campaigns, the resources of the
                                               state will fall short. Thus, while we have heard of stupid haste in war, we have not yet seen a clever
                                               operation that was prolonged.
                                           •   Generally, in strategic planning the best policy is to take a state intact; to ruin it is inferior to this. To
                                               capture the enemy’s entire army is better than to destroy it; to take intact a regiment, a company, or
                                               a squad is better than to destroy it. For to win one hundred victories in one hundred battles is not the
                                               epitome of skill. To subdue the enemy without fighting is the supreme excellence. Those skilled in
                                               war subdue the enemy’s army without battle.
                                           •   The art of using troops is this: When ten to the enemy’s one, surround him. When five times his
                                               strength, attack him. If double his strength, divide him. If equally matched, you may engage him with
                                               some good plan. If weaker, be capable of withdrawing. And if in all respects unequal, be capable of
                                               eluding him.
                                           •   Know your enemy and know yourself, and in a hundred battles you will never be defeated. When you
                                               are ignorant of the enemy but know yourself, your chances of winning or losing are equal. If ignorant
                                               both of your enemy and of yourself, you are sure to be defeated in every battle.
                                           •   He who occupies the field of battle first and awaits his enemy is at ease, and he who comes later to
                                               the scene and rushes into the fight is weary; those skilled in war bring the enemy to the field of battle
                                               rather than being brought there by him.
                                           •   Analyze the enemy’s plans so that you will know his deficiencies as well as his strengths. Agitate him
                                               to ascertain the pattern of his movement. Lure him out to reveal his dispositions and position. Launch
                                               probing attacks to decipher strengths and weaknesses.
                                           •   Avoid strength. Strike weakness. Anyone able to win the victory by modifying his tactics in accor-
                                               dance with the enemy situation may be said to be divine.
                                           •   If you decide to go into battle, do not announce your intentions or plans. Project “business as usual.”
                                           •   Unskilled leaders work out their conflicts on battlefields. Brilliant strategists rarely go to battle; they
                                               achieve their objectives through tactical positioning well in advance of confrontation.
                                           •   When you do decide to challenge another company (or army), much calculating, estimating, analyz-
                                               ing, and positioning bring triumph. Little computation brings defeat.
                                           •   Skillful leaders do not let a strategy inhibit creative counter-movement. Thus, commands from a
                                               distance should not interfere with spontaneous maneuvering at the point of attack.
                                           •   When a decisive advantage is gained over a rival, skillful leaders do not press on. They hold their
                                               position and give their rivals the opportunity to surrender or merge. Never allow your forces to be
                                               damaged by those who have nothing to lose.

                                          Note: The word strategic planning is substituted for war or warfare.

        IMPLICATIONS FOR STUDENTS
        In performing strategic-management case analysis, emphasize               way early and often in your presentation for what you ultimately
        throughout your project, beginning with the first page or slide,          recommend your firm should do over the next three years. The no-

        More importantly, emphasize throughout how you recommend the              of every page or PowerPoint slide. Therefore, avoid being merely
        firm sustain and grow its competitive advantages and how you rec-         descriptive in your written or oral analysis; rather, be prescriptive,

               Chapter Summary
               All firms have a strategy, even if it is informal, unstructured, and sporadic. All organizations are
               heading somewhere, but unfortunately some organizations do not know where they are going.
               The old saying “If you do not know where you are going, then any road will lead you there!”
               accents the need for organizations to use strategic-management concepts and techniques. The
               strategic-management process is becoming more widely used by small firms, large companies,
               nonprofit institutions, governmental organizations, and multinational conglomerates alike. The
               process of empowering managers and employees has almost limitless benefits.
                     Organizations should take a proactive rather than a reactive approach in their industry, and
               they should strive to influence, anticipate, and initiate rather than just respond to events. The
               ­strategic-management process embodies this approach to decision making. It represents a logical,
                systematic, and objective approach for determining an enterprise’s future direction. The stakes
                are generally too high for strategists to use intuition alone in choosing among alternative courses
                of action. Successful strategists take the time to think about their businesses, where they are with
                their businesses, and what they want to be as organizations; and then they implement programs
                and policies to get from where they are to where they want to be in a reasonable period of time.
                     It is a known and accepted fact that people and organizations that plan ahead are much more
                likely to become what they want to become than those that do not plan at all. A good strategist
                plans and controls his or her plans, whereas a bad strategist never plans and then tries to control
                people! This text is devoted to providing you with the tools necessary to be a good strategist.

               The answer to the first part of the question posed may be Tesla Inc., the U.S. electric automobile
               manufacturer founded in 2003 and headquartered in Palo Alto, California. The answer to the second
               part of the question may be “by matching internal strengths/weaknesses with external opportunity/

               threats” using SWOT analysis. For the first time ever, in 2017, Tesla joined the Fortune 500 largest
               companies in the United States; the company’s annual revenues exceed $7 billion.
                   An integral part of Tesla’s excellent strategic plan is to capitalize on the 6.5 percent annual gross
               domestic product (GDP) growth in China, compared to the GDP growth of about 2 percent in the United
               States. Tesla’s sales in China skyrocketed in recent years as CEO Elon Musk of Tesla capitalizes heavily
               on the firm’s technological prowess (internal strength) matched with China’s booming GDP (external
               opportunity) and China’s strong preference for electric vehicles (external opportunity). In 2016, sales
               of electric and plug-in hybrid automobiles in China rose 50 percent to 507,000, more than triple the
               comparable figure in the United States. Electric vehicles are viewed in China as a way to help clear
               smoggy skies (an external opportunity), and that is a primary reason why China’s government has ex-
               empted electric cars from rigid license plate restrictions in six large cities: Shanghai, Beijing, Shenzhen,
               Hangzhou, Guangzhou, and Tianjin; these six cities report the highest Tesla sales.
                   Tesla’s strategic plan includes manufacturing cars in China by the end of 2018, because shipping
               cars from California to China is costly. Tariffs and taxes incurred to export cars to China increases
               the price of Tesla sedans and SUVs by 50 percent (external threat). The number of electric vehi-
               cle charging stations in China exceeds one thousand (external opportunity). Tesla mass produces its

                                           Turning to Australia, Tesla recently supplied the largest battery in the world to Jamestown, Aus-
                                      tralia. The battery is storing electricity from a new wind farm that supplies thirty thousand homes with
                                      power. The battery has a 100-megawatt capacity. Tesla’s strategic plan is for the whole world to use its
                                      batteries in cars, trucks, homes, and businesses.

                                   THE COHESION CASE

                                  Coca-Cola Company, 2018
                                  BY FRED R. DAVID
                                  www.coca-cola.com, KO
                                  Headquartered in Atlanta, Georgia, Coca-Cola Company (Coke) is the world’s largest producer
                                  and distributor of beverages, marketing over 500 nonalcoholic brands in more than 200 countries.
                                  Coke has 21 billion-dollar brands, 19 of which are available in lower- and no-sugar options. Four
                                  of the top five beverages sold globally are Coke products: 1) Coca-Cola, 2) Diet Coke, 3) Fanta,
                                  and 4) Sprite. Other Coke products include Dasani waters, Fanta, Gold Peak teas and coffees,
                                  Honest Tea, Powerade sports drinks, Simply juices, Glaceau Smartwater, Sprite, and Zico coconut
                                  water. However, company’s revenues for 2017 declined 15 percent, so rumblings are spreading
                                  within the firm.
                                      Coke brands sold mostly outside the United States include Ayataka green tea in Japan, I LOHAS
                                  water in Japan, Ice Dew water in China, FUZE TEA outside the United States, Minute Maid Pulpy in
                                  Asia Pacific, Georgia coffee in Japan, and Del Valle in Latin America. Five large independent bottling
                                  companies supply Coke with 39 percent of their bottling needs, led by Coca-Cola FEMSA that sup-
                                  plies central Mexico and countries in Latin and South America.
                                      Coke revenues have declined every year for nearly a decade, usually accompanied by net income
                                  declines. Since 2005, sales of diet soda in general have dropped every year, a combined 34 percent.
                                  Although Diet Coke is the weakest link in the company’s whole soda lineup, the brand is still the third
                                  best-selling carbonated drink in the United States.
                                      Environmentalists are complaining, saying Coke produces 110 million plastic bottles annually
                                  that end up in landfills and oceans. To combat this complaint, the company launched in 2018 its
                                  “World Without Waste” initiative. Coke needs a good strategic plan because its customer base is erod-
                                  ing and its shareholders want sustained 5 percent annual growth in revenues and profits—and not
                                  declines—every year.

                                  History
                                  Founded in 1886, Coke’s flagship product Coca-Cola was invented in 1886 by pharmacist John Pemberton
                                  in Columbus, Georgia. Coke has operated a franchised distribution system since 1889, whereby the com-
                                  pany only produces syrup concentrate, which is then sold to various bottlers throughout the world, who
                                  hold exclusive territories.
                                      Interestingly, the big, jolly man in the red suit with a white beard (Santa Claus), did not always
                                  look that way. In 1931, Coke paid illustrator Haddon Sundblom to create advertising images depicting
                                  a jolly, plump, red (like Coke cans) dressed, warm, friendly Santa Claus delivering toys to children.
                                  To create the new Santa ads, Sundblom used Clement Clark Moore’s 1822 poem “A Visit from
                                  St. Nicholas” (commonly called “’Twas the Night Before Christmas”).
                                      Coke’s new Santa advertisements debuted in 1931 in magazines such as The Saturday Evening
                                  Post, National Geographic, The New Yorker, and others. Before 1931, Santa was depicted as every-
                                  thing from a tall gaunt man to a spooky-looking elf. He was often shown wearing a bishop’s robe
                                  and a Norse huntsman’s animal skin. From 1931 to 1934, Coke ads featuring the new Santa Claus
                                  changed the whole world’s view of Santa; these original images of Santa are valuable works of art
                                  even today.
                                      In 2010, Coke became the first brand to exceed 1 billion euros in annual United Kingdom
                                  grocery sales. In January 2018, in the United States, Coke introduced its slimmer 12-ounce Diet
                                  Coke can, updating the logo and offering the 35-year-old drink four new flavors: mango, cherry,
                                  blood orange, and ginger lime. Diet Coke sales have declined as more people switch to other
                                  low-calorie drinks, such as flavored fizzy water. The company said the new flavors and look—
                                  with a different color vertical stripe for each flavor and red for plain—are aimed at appealing to
                                  millennials (people ages 18 to 34). Coke tested more than 30 flavors before settling on the four
                                  new ones.

               Core Values, Vision, and Mission
               Provided on the corporate website, Coke’s core values center on seven words: leadership, collaboration,
               integrity, accountability, passion, diversity, and quality. Coke’s vision statement has not changed in more
               than a decade; provided on the corporate website, it reads (paraphrased):
                     People: To be a workplace where people are inspired to be the best they can be.
                     Portfolio: To offer quality beverage brands that anticipate/satisfy consumer desires/needs.
                     Partners: To nurture customers and suppliers working together to provide value.
                     Planet: To be a responsible citizen helping build and support sustainable communities.
                     Profit: To maximize long-term return to shareowners given our overall responsibilities.
                     Productivity: To be an effective, lean, and fast-moving company.
                   Coke’s mission statement too has not changed in more than a decade and is given on the corporate
               website; it reads (paraphrased): “To refresh the planet; to create moments of optimism and happiness;
               to provide value and make a difference.”


               Business Ethics and Diversity
               The Coke website says the company “directs zero advertising targeted to children under age 12.” Also,
               in regards to business ethics, the company places substantial nutrition information, including calories,
               on the front of most of their cans and packages. A wide range of packaging sizes are provided and
               over 100 reduced, low, or no-calorie beverages.
                    Coke annually publishes an elaborate Sustainability Report that details the company’s water stew-
               ardship, women’s economic empowerment, and philanthropic giving. In addition, the company’s year
               2020 sustainability goals include the firm giving back 1 percent of the company’s operating income
               annually, and recovering 75 percent of the recyclable bottles and cans introduced into developed mar-
               kets. The report is available on the corporate website.


               Financial Position
               Coke’s fiscal year ends on December 31. As indicated in Exhibit 1, Coke posted revenues of $35.4 billion
               in 2017, compared to $41.8 billion in 2016, a 15 percent decline. Net income was $1.28 billion compared
               to $6.66 billion in 2016, an 81 percent decline. Declines in both of these numbers are alarming. Note all the
               negative numbers in Exhibit 1, even though for most companies 2017 was a very properous year.
                   Coke’s balance sheets are provided in Exhibit 2. Note that Coke purchased $3.7 billion of its
               own stock in 2017. In 2017, Coke paid $5 billion out to shareholders in dividends even though the
               company’s net income was only $1.28 billion. Thus, basically the company borrowed money to pay
               dividends; this event resulted in a negative retained earnings for the year 2017 and a large drop in re-
               tained earnings on the 2017 balance sheet, as shown in Exhibit 2. Note in Exhibit 2 that Coke’s paid-
               in-capital increased a whopping 89 percent in 2017 revealing high use of equity as a source of capital.

                                     Exhibit 3 reveals that Coke spends about $4 billion annually to advertise its beverages. Note also
                                 in Exhibit 3 that the company is intent on increasing its dividends paid every year even if it has to bor-
                                 row money to make this payment. The company’s long-term debt is creeping up every year.


                                 Operating Segments
                                 Regarding 2017 cases of beverages sold, the USA accounted for 19 percent of the company total; case
                                 volume outside the USA accounted for 81 percent of sales. Of the 19 percent of cases sold in the USA, 62
                                 percent were sparkling soft drinks.
                                     The four countries outside the United States that Coke sells most to are Mexico, China, Brazil,
                                 and Japan. These four countries accounted for 31 percent of Coke’s outside-USA sales in 2017, and
                                 71 percent of these sales were of sparkling soft drinks. Coke’s revenues derived from the United
                                 States compared to the rest of the world through 2016 are given in Exhibit 4; the company did not
                                 provide this breakdown in 2017, perhaps because of significant declines. Note the decreases in 2016

               (3) North America, (4) Asia Pacific, and (5) Bottling Investments. Revenues and operating profits by
               segment are provided in Exhibit 5 and Exhibit 6, respectively. Note that North America generates 29.9
               percent of coke revenues and 34.4 percent of operating income. Note that only one segment, Latin
               America, showed an increase in operating income in 2017.

                                                   Regarding number of cases of various product lines sold in 2017, Exhibit 7 reveals that only two
                                               of four categories increased: (1) Water, enhanced water, and sports drinks, up 1 percent, and (2) Tea
                                               and coffee, up 2 percent.


                                               Organizational Structure
                                               Coke’s top executives and organizational structure are given in Exhibit 8. Note the segment top persons

                                               Competitors
                                               PepsiCo, Inc. and Dr Pepper Snapple are Coke’s two primary competitors, but other rival firms include
                                               Nestlé SA, Groupe Danone, Suntory Beverage & Food Limited (“Suntory”), and Monster Beverage
                                               Corporation. Unlike Coke, PepsiCo derives most of its revenues and growth from its snack food business

                                               producer, Dr Pepper Snapple, produces and markets nonalcoholic beverages in the United States, Canada,

                                               Coke, inclusive of Coke Zero, Diet Coke, and other brands, lead among the top 10, but PepsiCo has four
                                               brands in the top 10. In the percentage-change column in Exhibit 9, notice that bottled water has the
                                               largest growth.

               Mug brands; and ready-to-drink tea and coffee, and juices. PepsiCo’s Frito-Lay segment offers Lays
               and Ruffles potato chips; Doritos, Tostitos, and Santitas tortilla chips; and Cheetos cheese-flavored
               snacks, branded dips, and Fritos corn chips. PepsiCo’s Quaker Foods segment provides Quaker oat-

               and Coca-Cola are both investing in craft soda brands trying to reverse decreasing soda volume sales.
               After acquiring two craft soda brands from Monster Beverages, Coca-Cola recently relaunched Blue
               Sky and Hansen’s. A few days later, PepsiCo launched the 1893 Original Cola and Ginger Cola lines,
               which are made with sparkling water, kola nut extract, and Fair Trade–certified sugar.

    62    PART 1 • OVERVIEW OF STRATEGIC MANAGEMENT

                                     PepsiCo is having trouble with its Gatorade energy drink brand whose sales in the United States
                                 declined 0.5 percent to $5.9 billion in 2017. This was the brand’s first decline in annual sales since
                                 2012. Gatorade accounts for about 20 percent of PepsiCo’s North American drink volume. The com-
                                 pany released Gatorade Organic in August 2016 and made $20 million on that product through the
                                 end of 2017. The sports-drink market is becoming highly competitive; even up-start BodyArmour, a
                                 distant third in market share, is gaining rapidly on PepsiCo in sports drinks, such as Gatorade.
                                 Dr Pepper Snapple Group, Inc. (DPS)
                                 Headquartered in Plano, Texas, DPS manufactures nonalcoholic beverages in the United States,
                                 Canada, Mexico, and the Caribbean. It also markets ready-to-drink teas, juices, juice drinks, water, and
                                 mixers. The company offers brands such as: 7UP, A&W, Bai, Crush, Canada Dry, Schweppes, Sunkist
                                 soda, Squirt, Hawaiian Punch, and RC Cola. DPS manufactures and sells Mott’s apple sauces. DPS’s
                                 revenues increased slightly from $6.2 billion in 2014 to $6.3 billion in 2015, to $6.4 billion in 2016,
                                 to $6.7 in 2017. DPS’s net income also has increased slightly every year, from $703 million in 2014
                                 to $770 million in 2017. DPS recently acquired Bai Brands for about $1.7 billion. DPS currently has
                                 about 8.5 percent of the U.S. nonalcoholic beverage market, according to Euromonitor International.
                                     DPS owns seven of the top 10 noncola soft drinks on the market. Third-quarter (Q3) 2017 results
                                 showed DPS’s carbonated soft drinks decreasing 1 percent, whereas its noncarbonated beverages in-
                                 creased 6 percent. Q3 showed flat sales in the United States and Canada, but sales in Mexico and the
                                 Caribbean increased 2 percent. Also for Q3, the DPS brand named Clamato grew 7 percent and Mott’s
                                 sauce sales grew 5 percent, but Snapple sales declined 5 percent.
                                     The big news in the beverage industry is that Keurig Green Mountain, the maker of Keurig K-Cup
                                 coffee machines, acquired Dr Pepper Snapple in 2018. Keurig is privately owned by JAB Holdings,
                                 one of Europe’s largest investment firms; JAB also owns Peeet’s Coffee, Panera Bread, and Krispy
                                 Kreme doughnuts. JAB is a privately held fund that manages the money of the Reimann family, one
                                 of Germany’s wealthiest families. This acquisition is aimed directly at both Coca-Cola and Starbucks
                                 Corp. This acquisition puts Keurig in the global soda business and strengthens its coffee business.
                                 Euromonitor reports that sales of ready-to-drink coffees increased more than 17 percent in 2017.
                                 JAB’s partner in Keurig is Mondelez International that holds roughly 24 percent of the stock JAB, but
                                 that percentage dropped to about 14 percent when the Dr Pepper acquisition was finalized. Keurig’s
                                 revenue for 2017 was about $4.1 billion and its market share in the coffee-pod industry has declined
                                 from 40 percent in 2013 to about 23 percent in 2017.

                                 Groupe Danone
                                 Headquartered in Paris, France, Groupe Danone is the number-one producer of yogurt in the world, the
                                 number-two bottled water and baby nutrition manufacturer, number-one in manufacturing fresh dairy
                                 products, and the European leader in medical nutrition. Danone’s primary brand in bottled water is Evian.
                                 Danone sells flavored waters and focuses on health-conscious consumers. One brand is Levite, a big suc-
                                 cess in Mexico. Danone continues to add new drinks in different markets, such as Taillefine Fiz in France,
                                 which is a zero-calorie soda that has achieved a number-two ranking in the French low-calorie segment.
                                 Danone is present in more than 130 markets and generated sales of €21.9 billion in 2016, with more than
                                 half of that revenue coming from emerging countries. Fresh dairy products represent about 50 percent

                                 Headquartered in Corona, California, Monster Beverage develops, markets, sells, and distributes
                                 ­energy-drink beverages, sodas, or concentrates for energy-drink beverages, under brand names such as
                                  Monster Energy, Monster Rehab, Monster Energy Extra Strength Nitrous Technology, Java Monster,
                                  Muscle Monster, Mega Monster Energy, Punch Monster, Juice Monster, Ubermonster, BU, Mutant
                                  Super Soda, Nalu, NOS, Burn, Mother, Ultra, Play and Power Play, Gladiator, Relentless, Samurai,
                                  BPM, and Full Throttle.
                                      Coca-Cola owns 16.7 percent of the Monster Beverage, which it purchased in 2015 for approx-
                                  imately $2.15 billion. In addition to the equity stake, both companies’ strategic partnerships related
                                  to business transfers and expanded global distribution. In October 2017, Coca-Cola transferred
                                  ownership of all of its worldwide energy businesses including NOS, Full Throttle, and nine smaller
                                  brands to Monster Beverage Company. At the same time, Monster transferred all of its nonenergy
                                  drink businesses to Coca-Cola, including Hansen’s natural sodas, Peace Tea, Hubert’s Lemonade,
                                  and Hansen’s juice products. As shown in Exhibit 10, energy drinks comprise 4.8 percent of all
                                  nonalcoholic beverages sold.

               The Nonalcoholic Beverage Industry
               Exhibit 11 reveals the annual growth (or decline) in various categories of beverages. Notice declines in sales
               of carbonated soft drinks and fruit drinks but rapid growth in sales of flavored and enhanced water and
               ready-to-drink coffee.
               Bottled Water
               In 2016, bottled water surpassed carbonated soft drinks as the largest beverage category in the United
               States by volume. Per-capita consumption of bottled water reached more than 39 gallons annually,
               compared with around 38.5 gallons for carbonated soft drinks. Within the next decade, bottled water
               consumption per capita is expected to surpass 50 gallons. The U.S. bottled water market showed
               strong growth in terms of volume and revenues in the past 3 years. Bottled water sales are booming,
               up 7.3, 7.9, and 8.6 percent in 2014, 2015, and 2016, respectively. By comparison, carbonated soft
               drink volumes declined 2.1, 2.4, and 0.8 percent during those same years. According to BMC, in
               2017, bottled water sales are projected to grow 8 to 9 percent, remaining the top nonalcoholic bever-
               age for years to come, further confirmation of the shift in consumer preference toward healthier and
               lower-calorie options.
               Sparkling Water
               Sparkling water is projected to outpace even bottled water in the next decade as consumers search
               for tastier but healthier options. In fact, sparkling water sales surged more than 20 percent in 2017.
               Flavored sparkling water sales grew by more than 15 percent in 2017 to $2.4 billion. To better reach
               this flavored sparking water market, early in 2018 PepsiCo released its seltzer water brand called
               Bubly. Other beverages also growing in sales are flavored and enhanced water, ready-to-drink
               ­coffee, and energy drinks. Specifically, sales of flavored and enhanced water in the United States
                increased 12.3 percent in 2016, followed by ready-to-drink coffee up 11 percent, and energy drinks
                up 4.8 percent.
                    Given these positive trends, carbonated soft drinks still account for 83.5 percent of the bever-
                ages industry’s market capitalization as of September 2017. In 2016, soda consumption in the United
                States fell 0.8 percent, continuing the downward trend. Consequently, in Q2 2017, Coke reported
                a 16 percent drop in net revenues to $9.7 billion. In that Q2, Coke reported increased volume for
                juice, dairy, and plant-based beverages (with 3% growth), tea and coffee (2%), as well as water, en-
                hanced water, and sports drinks (1%). Coke is shifting its portfolio toward smaller-sized packages and
                healthier beverages. In August 2017, Coke replaced its Coke Zero products with the zero-sugar and

    64    PART 1 • OVERVIEW OF STRATEGIC MANAGEMENT

                                 zero-calorie brand Coke Zero Sugar. For PepsiCo, food and snacks volume increased 2 percent in the
                                 first half of 2017, whereas beverages declined 1 percent.
                                 R&D
                                 To reverse revenue declines, beverage firms boosted R&D spending at an average annual rate of nearly
                                 20 percent over the past 5 years. R&D spending is likely to remain high in 2017 and 2018 as beverage
                                 companies strive to rejuvenate revenue growth. Developing flavored sparkling waters is an example.
                                 Outside the United States
                                 In 2016, international operations represented 62 percent of total nonbottling revenues at Coke and
                                 42 percent at PepsiCo. Coke does business in countries using currencies other than the U.S. dollar,
                                 including the euro, the Japanese yen, the Brazilian real, and the Mexican peso. Coke uses 72 curren-
                                 cies in addition to the U.S. dollar. Unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates can have a significant
                                 effect on reported revenue growth for global beverage manufacturers, especially because the U.S. dol-
                                 lar’s value relative to foreign currencies is on average at a 3-year low.
                                      There are uncertainties going forward in our major international markets, including the United
                                 Kingdom’s impending withdrawal from the European Union, commonly referred to as “Brexit,” which
                                 is due to be finalized as of December 2020 and unstable political conditions, including civil unrest
                                 and governmental changes, in certain other international markets could undermine global consumer
                                 confidence and reduce consumers’ purchasing power, thereby reducing demand for our products.
                                 City, County, State, and Federal Taxes
                                 Public health advocates are actively lobbying for tax referendums and legislation in more U.S. cities
                                 to tax soda. Companies such as Coke and PepsiCo Soda spent nearly $70 million from 2009 to 2016
                                 lobbying against soda taxes and warning label measures in U.S. cities and states, as well as an average
                                 of about $15 million annually on federal lobbying, according to the consumer advocacy group Center
                                 for Science in the Public Interest (CSPI). For example, beverage companies spent about $9.4 million
                                 between January 2016 and June 2016 to oppose the Philadelphia City Council’s soda tax proposal, ac-
                                 cording to CSPI’s estimates. Philadelphia eventually imposed a soda tax in June 2016, the first major
                                 U.S. city (and the second city after Berkeley, California) to do so. In November 2016, three cities in
                                 California (San Francisco, Albany, and Oakland) passed their own soda tax laws, as did Cook County,
                                 Illinois (which includes Chicago) and Boulder, Colorado. In June 2017, Seattle implemented a tax of
                                 1.75 cents per ounce on sugary drinks and soda. Chicago’s soda tax began in the Fall 2017.
                                      Taxes on sugary beverages came into effect in Mexico on January 1, 2014, in an effort to combat obe-
                                 sity in the country; higher product costs are likely to dampen demand, and tax revenue could help to fund
                                 costs related to preventive actions and medical treatment. Mexico is the country with the biggest obesity
                                 problem in the world, according to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations. This
                                 will be a game changer for beverage companies exporting to Mexico (such as Coke). In 2015, soda sales
                                 in Mexico plummeted 12 percent. Price-sensitive consumers are turning away from buying soda products.
                                 Beverage Caloric Intake in the United States
                                 The American Beverage Association reported in December 2017 that the average American drank
                                 201.2 calories a day in 2016, up slightly from 2015. More than offsetting the decline in sales of
                                 soda and juice in cans or bottles, sales of soda from fountains in restaurants are increasing. And
                                 Americans are drinking more and more sweet tea at restaurants. In terms of liquid intake, the average
                                 beverage calories consumed in the United States per capita per day in 2016 was sodas (126.7), juice
                                 (42.5), teas (11.2), sports (10.6), and other (10.2) according to the Beverage Marketing Corporation.
                                 Consumption of diet and low-calorie soda continues to fall, but consumption of sports and energy
                                 drinks continues to rise at a faster rate.
                                 Impulse Buying
                                 PepsiCo is reinvesting some of the millions of dollars it is saving under the new tax laws in e­ -commerce,
                                 which today accounts for roughly $1 billion in the company’s annual retail sales. PepsiCo is also in-
                                 vesting savings in training for workers, cash returns for shareholders, and $100 million in employee
                                 bonuses. The rise of online shopping is bad news for Coca-Cola and PepsiCo because impulse buy-
                                 ing makes up roughly 30 percent of overall beverage sales. Without customers grabbing a Diet Pepsi
                                 while checking out at Walmart or a two-liter bottle of Coke Zero at the grocery store, the beverage
                                 companies would be in big trouble. Sales of soft drinks by volume have dropped for 12 consecutive
                                 years in the United States, so companies like Coca-Cola and PepsiCo need impulse buying, which is
                                 being eroded by more online shopping. Coca-Cola is currently investigating click-and-collect grocery
                                 sales, bundled deals (such as meal kits), and new impulse “triggers” online.

               The Future
               Coke swung from net income of $550 million in Q4 2016 to a net loss of $2.75 billion in Q4 2017. This
               decline was mostly due to a one-time charge of $3.6 billion blamed on the new federal tax law, which forced
               Coke to pay taxes on certain past offshore earnings. However, Coke supports the tax changes because its
               effective tax rate is expected to decline to 21 percent in 2018.
                   The steady decline in consumption of carbonated beverages necessitates Coke formulating and
               implementing new strategies going forward. The company needs a full-blown, comprehensive stra-
               tegic plan to determine specific actions needed under the following general categories of strategies:
                   1.   Further global expansion to tap markets not yet saturated
                   2.   Continued product development to introduce new healthy drinks
                   3.   Acquisition of small rival firms to gain growth in revenues
                   4.   Continued market penetration with extensive advertising and promotion to shift consumer
                        ­perception away from unhealthiness to treating yourself with a soda
                   5.    Continued shift to smaller cans and package sizes
                   6.    Perhaps diversification into snacks and foods as PepsiCo has successfully done
                   7.    Push aggressively into bottled water to capitalize on rapid growth in that sector
                   8.    Develop natural sweeteners to replace artificial sweeteners
                   9.    Increase lobbying to curtail city, county, and state sugar taxes

                                 Gather Strategy Information for Coca-Cola
                                 Company
               Purpose
               The primary purpose of this exercise is to show students how to obtain vital information for doing case
               analysis or preparing a strategic plan for any publicly held firm. The secondary purpose is to familiarize
               you with (1) strategy terms introduced in this chapter and (2) key sources of information for doing strategic
               planning. Generally in a strategic-management course, teams of students prepare a strategic plan (case anal-
               ysis) for some assigned company, so this exercise can assist in learning how to get started in such a project.
               Instructions
               Step 1            Read the Coca-Cola Cohesion Case and list what you consider to be the firm’s strengths,
                                 weaknesses, opportunities, and threats. Then, go to the corporate website at www.coca-
                                 colacompany.com, scroll down to the bottom of the website, and click on Investors. Click
                                 Annual Reports and then click 2017 Annual Report or Form 10K. Download this pdf file to
                                 your desktop; peruse the information and add to your list of Coca-Cola’s strengths, weak-
                                 nesses, opportunities, and threats.
               Step 2            Go to your college library website and download to your desktop Standard & Poor’s Industry
                                 Surveys PDF file for the beverage industry. Use this information to add to your list of Coca-
                                 Cola’s strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats.
               Step 3            Go to the www.finance.yahoo.com website. Enter the stock symbol KO. Note the wealth
                                 of information on Coca-Cola that may be obtained by clicking any item along the row
                                 below the company name. Use this data to refine your lists of key external and internal
                                 factors. Each factor listed for this exercise should include a percentage, number, dollar, or
                                 ratio to reveal some quantified fact or trend. These factors provide the underlying basis for
                                 a strategic plan because a firm strives to take advantage of strengths, improve weaknesses,
                                 avoid threats, and capitalize on opportunities. Avoid vagueness in strategic planning.

                                 Perform SWOT Analysis for My University
                                 Purpose
                                 The purpose of this exercise is to apply SWOT analysis to a nonprofit organization—namely your
                                 college or university. SWOT analysis is the most widely used of all strategic planning tools and
                                 techniques because it is conceptually simple and lends itself readily to discussion among manag-
                                 ers. SWOT analysis formulates strategies by matching an organization’s internal strengths and
                                 weaknesses with external opportunities and threats to generate feasible strategies to be considered.
                                      For a university, external factors could include declining numbers of high school graduates;
                                 population shifts; community relations; increased competitiveness among colleges and universi-
                                 ties; rising numbers of adults returning to college; decreased support from local, state, and federal
                                 agencies; increasing numbers of foreign students attending U.S. colleges; and a rising number of
                                 Internet courses.
                                      Internal factors of a college or university could be related to faculty, students, staff, alumni,
                                 athletic programs, physical plant, grounds and maintenance, student housing, administration, fund-
                                 raising, academic programs, food services, parking, placement, clubs, fraternities, sororities, and
                                 public relations.
                                 Instructions
                                 Step 1         For your university, identify four External Opportunities, four External Threats, four Internal
                                                Strengths, and four Internal Weaknesses.
                                 Step 2         Match your external with internal factors to develop or generate two SO Strategies, two WO
                                                Strategies, two ST Strategies, and two WT Strategies. For example, an SO Strategy to “Double
                                                the number of online course offerings in three years” could be developed or generated based

               Perform SWOT Analysis on Myself
               Purpose
               This exercise can help you decide on the best career path for yourself. Individuals and organizations
               are alike in many ways. Each has competitors and each should plan for the future. Every individual
               (and organization) faces some external opportunities and threats, some internal strengths and weak-
               nesses, and reaches pivotal forks in the road. These and other similarities make it possible for in-
               dividuals to use many corporate strategic-management concepts and tools such as SWOT analysis.
               Instructions
               Introduced in this chapter, SWOT analysis a popular strategic planning tool that can help individuals
               in career planning. Individuals can perform SWOT analysis by completing the following six steps:
                   1. Identify four external opportunities you face.
                   2. Identify four external threats you face.
                   3. Identify four of your personal strengths.
                   4. Identify four personal weaknesses.
                   5. Develop SO (strength-opportunity), WO (weakness-opportunity), ST (strength-threat), WT
                      (weakness-threat) strategies—two strategies of each type, thus eight strategies total.
                   6. Select three strategies to implement.
                    An external opportunity could be, for example, that your university offers a graduate program that
               interests you, whereas an external threat could be that interest rates are rising precluding getting a
               loan. A weakness could be a low grade-point average, whereas a personal strength may be three years
               of work experience. Strategy is sometimes defined as “the match” a person (or firm) makes between
               its internal resources and skills and the opportunities and risks created by its external factors. When a
               person has major weaknesses, he or she should strive to overcome them and perhaps convert them into
               strengths. When a person faces major threats, they should seek to avoid or mitigate the effects of them
               to focus on opportunities. Even though SWOT analysis is explained considerably more in Chapter 6,
               give it a try here to help in planning your next career move.

               EXERCISE 1E

               How Detrimental Are Various Pitfalls in
               Strategic Planning?
               Purpose
               Whenever a firm engages in strategic planning, there are certain potholes or pitfalls that need to be
               avoided. Being aware of potential pitfalls and being prepared to address them is essential to suc-
               cess. A list of thirteen pitfalls that commonly plague firms and undermine strategic-planning efforts
               follows. These can be ranked in terms of how potentially detrimental or severe they are in doing
               strategic planning. This exercise reveals the authors’ ranking of the thirteen pitfalls in terms of how
               potentially detrimental or severe they are in doing strategic planning.

                                  1.   Using strategic planning to gain control over decisions and resources
                                  2.   Doing strategic planning only to satisfy accreditation or regulatory requirements
                                  3.   Too hastily moving from mission development to strategy formulation
                                  4.   Failing to communicate the plan to employees, who continue working in the dark
                                  5.   Top managers making many intuitive decisions that conflict with the formal plan
                                  6.   Top managers not actively supporting the strategic-planning process
                                  7.   Failing to use plans as a standard for measuring performance
                                  8.   Delegating planning to a “planner” rather than involving all managers
                                  9.   Failing to involve key employees in all phases of planning
                                 10.   Failing to create a collaborative climate supportive of change
                                 11.   Viewing planning as unnecessary or unimportant
                                 12.   Becoming so engrossed in current problems that insufficient or no planning is done
                                 13.   Being so formal in planning that flexibility and creativity are stifled
                                     The purpose of this exercise is to examine and discuss how potentially detrimental or severe the
                                 various pitfalls are in doing strategic planning. In addition, the purpose of this exercise is to examine
                                 whether individual decision making is better than group decision making. Academic research sug-
                                 gests that groups make better decisions than individuals about 80 percent of the time.
                                 Steps
                                  1. Fill in Column 1 in Table 1-9 to reveal your individual ranking of how potentially detrimental
                                     to strategic planning the pitfalls are, where 1 = most detrimental to 13 = least detrimental. For
                                     example, if you feel Pitfall 1 is the fifth most detrimental, then enter a 5 in Table 1 in Column 1
                                     beside Pitfall 1.
                                  2. Fill in Column 2 in Table 1-9 to reveal your group’s ranking of the thirteen pitfalls.
                                  3. Fill in Column 3 in Table 1-9 to reveal the expert’s ranking of the thirteen pitfalls. (To be provided by
                                     your professor, the expert rankings are based on the authors’ experience and the end of the chapter.)
                                  4. Fill in Column 4 in Table 1-9 to reveal the absolute difference between Column 1 and Column 3
                                     to reveal how well you performed as an individual in this exercise. (Note: For absolute difference,

                   6. Sum Column 4. Sum Column 5.
                   7. Compare the Column 4 sum with the Column 5 sum. If your Column 4 sum is less than your
                      Column 5 sum, then you performed better as an individual than as a group. Normally, group
                      decision making is superior to individual decision making, so if you did better than your group,
                      you did excellent.

                                                    hapter 2 focuses on the concepts and tools needed to evaluate and write core values,
                                                    vision, and mission statements. As illustrated with shading in Figure 2-1, carefully
                                                    prepared statements of vision and mission are widely recognized by both practitioners and
                                            academicians as the first step in strategic management. Actual vision and mission statements from
                                            large and small organizations and for-profit and nonprofit enterprises are presented and critiqued.
                                                 The exemplary strategist showcased is Frederick Smith, whose entrepreneurial vision four de-
                                            cades ago led to the creation of FedEx, a firm on a mission today to lead the package-delivery industry.
                                                 We can perhaps best understand core values, vision, and mission by focusing on a business
                                            when it is first started. In the beginning, a new business is simply a collection of ideas. Starting a new
                                            business rests on a set of beliefs that the organization can offer some product or service to some cus-
                                            tomers in some geographic area using some type of technology at a profitable price. A new business
                                            owner typically believes his or her philosophy of the new enterprise will result in a favorable pub-
                                            lic image, and the business concept can be effectively communicated to and adopted by important
                                            constituencies. When the ideas and beliefs about a business at its inception are put into writing, the
                                            resulting documents mirror the same basic ideas that underlie core values, vision, and mission state-
                                            ments. As a business grows, owners or managers may revise the founding set of beliefs, but those
                                            original ideas usually are still reflected in core values, vision, and mission statements.
                                                 Core values, vision, and mission statements often can be found in the front of annual reports
                                            and commonly displayed throughout a firm’s premises and distributed with company informa-
                                            tion sent to constituencies. These statements are part of numerous internal reports, such as loan
                                            requests, supplier agreements, labor relations contracts, business plans, and customer service
                                            agreements. However, too many companies and organizations today have no core values, vision,
                                            or mission statement, thus missing out on an incredible opportunity to motivate and energize
                                            customers, employees, and shareholders, and also jeopardizing their strategic-planning efforts.


                                 LO 2.1     Core Values Statements: What Is Our Foundation?
                                            Core values provide the needed ethical foundation for creating an excellent vision and mission. A

    Headquartered in Memphis, Tennessee, and founded in 1973 by
    Frederick W. Smith, FedEx is one of the few Fortune 500 companies

               owner. Great firms possess core values that remain fixed and almost never change. The core values
               of any firm should transcend technological changes, fads, product life cycles, and globalization.
                    Because vision and mission statements do change over time, it is vital to know who you are
               before you can discuss what you want to become, what business are you in, or how will you get there.
               Generally, if core values are open for change in the future, they are not core values. Disney for exam-

               Vision Statements: What Do We Want to Become?                                                                                         LO 2.2
               It is especially important for managers and executives in any firm to agree on the basic vision
               the organization strives to achieve in the long term. A vision statement should answer the basic
               question, “What do we want to become?” A clear vision provides the foundation for developing a
               comprehensive mission statement. Many organizations have both a vision and mission statement,
               but the vision statement should be established first. Examples of vision statements are provided
               in Table 2-1. The vision statement should be short, preferably one sentence, and as many manag-
               ers as possible should have input into developing the statement. In the book of Proverbs in the
               Bible, Chapter 29, Verse 18, says, “Where there is no vision, the people perish.”

                                               For many corporations, profit rather than vision or mission is the primary motivator, but
                                          profit alone is not enough to motivate people. It is not uncommon that profit is perceived nega-
                                          tively by many stakeholders of a firm. For example, employees could see profit as something
                                          that they earn and management then uses and even gives away to shareholders. Although this
                                          perception is undesired and disturbing to management, it clearly indicates that both profit and
                                          vision are needed to motivate a workforce effectively. Reuben Mark, former CEO of Colgate,
                                          maintains that a clear vision increasingly must make sense internationally. Mark’s thoughts on
                                          vision follows:

                                             When it comes to rallying everyone to the corporate banner, it’s essential to push one ­vision
                                             globally rather than trying to drive home different messages in different cultures. The trick is to
                                             keep the vision simple but elevated: “We make the world’s fastest c­ omputers” or “Telephone
                                             service for everyone.” You’re never going to get anyone to charge the machine guns only
                                             for financial objectives. It’s got to be something that makes people feel better, feel a part of
                                             something.1

                                               When employees and managers together shape or fashion a vision statement of a firm, the
                                          resultant document can reflect the personal visions that managers and employees have in their
                                          hearts and minds about their own futures. Shared vision creates a commonality of interests that
                                          can lift workers out of the monotony of daily work and put them into a new world of opportu-
                                          nity, challenge, and belongingness. The motivation, dedication, and commitment associated with
                                          shared vision is an immense potential benefit for any firm or organization.

                                 LO 2.3   Characteristics of a Vision Statement
                                          A vision statement should reveal the type of business the firm conducts. For example, a vision
                                          that says, “to become the best retail firm in the United States,” is too broad because that firm
                                          could be selling anything from apples (A) to zebras (Z). Although typically a single sentence,
                                          vision statements need to do more than identify the product or service a firm offers; vision
                                          statements should be written from a customer perspective. Ideally every organization wants
                                          its employees and customers to align their actions with the firm’s vision. To fulfill this need,
                                          an excellent vision statement describes a desired future state. Being futuristic enables vision
                                          statements to be used to facilitate organizational change. The statement needs to be doable but
                                          challenging.
                                               In summary, effective vision statements exhibit the following five characteristics; these five
                                          attributes can be used as guidelines for writing or evaluating vision statements. Any vision state-
                                          ment that scores a 5 out of 5 on these characteristics is exemplary. Let’s call this vision assess-

               Vision Statement Analysis
               There is no one best vision statement for a particular company in a given industry, but the 5-out-
               of-5 test can be used to both develop and evaluate vision statements. Six exemplary vision
               ­statements that meet the 5-out-of-5 test are provided in Table 2-1. Notice the Harley-Davidson
                statement meets the 5 criteria in just 11 words.
                     Four vision statements that do not meet the 5-out-of-5 test are given in Table 2-2.

               Mission Statements: What Is Our Business?                                                                  LO 2.4
               Current thought on mission statements is based largely on guidelines set forth in the mid-1970s
               by Peter Drucker, who is often called “the father of modern management” for his pioneering
               studies at General Motors and for his 22 books and hundreds of articles. Drucker believes that
               asking the question “What is our business?” is synonymous with asking “What is our mission?”
               An enduring statement of purpose that distinguishes one organization from other similar enter-
               prises, the mission statement, is a declaration of an organization’s “reason for being.” It answers
               the pivotal question “What is our business?” A clear mission statement is essential for effectively
               establishing objectives and formulating strategies.
                    Sometimes called a creed statement, a statement of purpose, a statement of philosophy, a
               statement of beliefs, a statement of business principles, or a statement “defining our business,” a
               mission statement reveals what an organization wants to be and who it wants to serve. All orga-
               nizations have a reason for being, even if strategists have not consciously transformed this reason
               into writing. Drucker has the following to say about mission statements (paraphrased):

                   A mission statement is the foundation for priorities, strategies, plans, and work assign-
                   ments. It is the starting point for the design of jobs and organizational structures. Nothing
                   may seem simpler or more obvious than to know what a company’s business is. A lumber
                   mill makes lumber, an airline carries passengers and freight, and a bank lends money. But
                   “What is our business?” is almost always a difficult question and the right answer is usually
                   anything but obvious. The answer to this question is the first responsibility of strategists.2

                    Some strategists spend almost every moment of every day on administrative and tactical concerns;
               those who rush quickly to establish objectives and implement strategies often overlook the development
               of a vision and mission statement. This problem is so widespread that many corporations, organizations,
               and small businesses in the United States have not yet developed a formal vision or mission statement.
                    Some companies develop mission statements simply because owners or top management
               believe it is fashionable, rather than out of any real commitment. However, firms that develop
               and systematically revisit their vision and mission statements, treat them as living documents,
               and consider them to be an integral part of the firm’s culture realize great benefits. For example,

                                          reaffirm the firm’s mission. The entire J&J workforce recognizes the value that top management
                                          places on this exercise, and these employees respond accordingly.


                                 LO 2.5   Characteristics of a Mission Statement
                                          A mission statement is a declaration of attitude and outlook. It usually is broad in scope for at least
                                          two major reasons. First, a quality mission statement allows for the generation and consideration of
                                          a range of feasible alternative objectives and strategies without unduly stifling management creativ-
                                          ity. Excess specificity would limit the potential of creative growth for the organization. However,
                                          an overly general statement that does not exclude any strategy alternatives could be dysfunctional.
                                          Apple’s mission statement, for example, should not open the possibility for diversification into
                                          pesticides—or Ford Motor Company’s into food processing.
                                                Second, a mission statement needs to be broad to reconcile differences among and appeal
                                          to an organization’s diverse stakeholders, the individuals and groups of individuals who have
                                          a special stake or claim on the company. Thus, a mission statement should be r­ econciliatory.
                                          Stakeholders include employees, managers, stockholders, boards of directors, customers, suppli-
                                          ers, distributors, creditors, governments (local, state, federal, and foreign), unions, competitors,
                                          environmental groups, and the general public. Stakeholders affect and are affected by an organi-
                                          zation’s strategies, yet the claims and concerns of diverse constituencies vary and often conflict.
                                          For example, the general public is especially interested in social responsibility, whereas stock-
                                          holders are more interested in profitability. Stakeholder expectations leveled on any business
                                          literally may number in the thousands, and they often include clean air, jobs, taxes, investment
                                          opportunities, career opportunities, equal employment opportunities, employee benefits, salaries,
                                          wages, clean water, and community services. All stakeholders’ expectations on an organization
                                          cannot be pursued with equal emphasis. A quality mission statement reveals that the organization
                                          will strive to meet the varied expectations of stakeholders.
                                                The statement of mission should be sufficiently broad to allow judgments about the most
                                          promising growth directions and those considered less promising. Numbers should not be
                                          included in a mission statement. George Steiner offers the following insight on the need for a
                                          mission statement to be broad in scope:

                                             Mission statements are not designed to express concrete ends, but rather to provide
                                             ­motivation, general direction, an image, a tone, and a philosophy to guide the enterprise.
                                              An excess of detail could prove counterproductive since concrete specification could be
                                              the base for rallying opposition; all in the firm need to be onboard with the firm’s mission.3

                                               An effective mission statement should not be too lengthy; the recommended length is less
                                          than one hundred words. An effective mission statement should arouse positive feelings and emo-
                                          tions about an organization; it should be inspiring in the sense that it motivates readers to action.
                                          A mission statement should be enduring, but never cast in stone, meaning that a statement may need
                                          to be changed at any time depending on changes anywhere in the integrative model of strategic
                                          management. This dynamic nature of both vision and mission statements is conveyed in Figure 2-1
                                          through the feedback loop. An effective mission statement generates the impression that a firm is
                                          successful, has direction, and is worthy of time, support, and investment from all stakeholders.
                                               A business mission reflects judgments about future growth directions and strategies that are
                                          based on forward-looking external and internal analyses. The statement should provide useful
                                          criteria for selecting among alternative strategies. A clear mission statement provides a basis
                                          for generating and screening strategic options. A mission statement should (1) define what the
                                          organization is, (2) be limited enough to exclude some ventures and broad enough to allow for
                                          creative growth, (3) distinguish a given organization from all others, (4) serve as a framework
                                          for evaluating both current and prospective activities, and (5) be stated in terms sufficiently clear
                                          to be widely understood throughout the organization.4 The mission statement should reflect the
                                          anticipations of customers. Rather than developing a product and then trying to find a market, the
                                          operating philosophy of organizations should be to identify customers’ needs and then provide a
                                          product or service to fulfill those needs.
                                               Table 2-3 summarizes 10 desired characteristics of an effective mission statement:

               TABLE 2-3 Characteristics of a Mission Statement
                     1. Broad in scope; does not include monetary amounts, numbers, percentages, ratios, or objectives
                     2. Concise; fewer than one hundred words in length
                     3. Inspiring
                     4. Identifies the utility of a firm’s products

                     7. Includes nine components: customers, products or services, markets, technology, concern for
                        survival/growth/profits, philosophy, distinctive competence, concern for public image, concern
                        for ­employees
                     8. Reconciliatory; resolves divergent views among stakeholders
                     9. Enduring but never cast in stone
                    10. Attracts customers; is written from a customer perspective



                    Quality mission statements identify the utility (value) of a firm’s products to its customers.
               This is why Verizon’s mission statement focuses on communication rather than on telephones; it
               is why ExxonMobil’s mission statement focuses on energy rather than on oil and gas; it is why
               Union Pacific’s mission statement focuses on transportation rather than on railroads; it is why
               Universal Studios’ mission statement focuses on entertainment rather than on movies. A major
               reason for developing a mission statement is to attract customers; all companies and organiza-
               tions must continually attract customers.
                    The following utility statements are relevant in developing a mission statement:
                       Do not offer me things.
                       Do not offer me clothes. Offer me attractive looks.
                       Do not offer me shoes. Offer me comfort for my feet and the pleasure of walking.
                       Do not offer me a house. Offer me security, comfort, and a place that is clean and happy.
                       Do not offer me books. Offer me hours of pleasure and the benefit of knowledge.
                       Do not offer me CDs. Offer me leisure and the sound of music.
                       Do not offer me tools. Offer me the benefits and the pleasure that come from making
                       beautiful things.
                       Do not offer me furniture. Offer me comfort and the quietness of a cozy place.
                       Do not offer me things. Offer me ideas, emotions, ambience, feelings, and benefits.
                       Please, do not offer me things.
                  Managers often perceive customer satisfaction as a valuable intangible asset to a firm; re-
               search suggests that customer satisfaction has a strong positive relationship with organizational
               performance.5 When written from a customer perspective, mission statements can spur employ-
               ees, salespersons, and managers to provide exemplary customer service, which arguably would
               enhance customer loyalty and translate into customers being “on a mission” to seek out, use,
               and promote the firm’s products and services.



               Components of a Mission Statement                                                                         LO 2.6
               Most practitioners and academicians of strategic management agree there are nine mission state-
               ment components to be included in an exemplary statement. Because a mission statement is often
               the most visible and public part of the strategic-management process, it is important that it includes
               both the ten characteristics summarized previously, and the following nine components:
                   1. Customers—Who are the firm’s present and potential customers?
                   2. Products or services—What are the firm’s major products or services?
                   3. Markets—Geographically, where does the firm compete?

    78    PART 2 • STRATEGY FORMULATION

                                  4. Technology—Is the firm technologically current?
                                  5. Concern for survival, growth, and profitability—Is the firm committed to growth and fi-
                                     nancial soundness?
                                  6. Philosophy—What are the basic beliefs, values, aspirations, and ethical priorities of the
                                     firm?
                                  7. Distinctive competence—What is the firm’s major competitive advantage?
                                  8. Concern for public image—Is the firm responsive to social, community, and environmen-
                                     tal concerns?
                                  9. Concern for employees—Are employees a valuable asset of the firm?6
                                      To exemplify how mission statements should be written to include all nine components, a
                                 component-by-component example for a charter boat fishing company is provided in Table 2-
                                 4. Note the charter company’s customers are “outdoor enthusiasts.” “Customers” is an impor-
                                 tant component to include in a mission statement, so merely including the word customer is
                                 not sufficient or adequate because that word alone will not “attract customers.” The statement
                                 needs to identify more precisely the target groups of customers. In fact, all nine components
                                 should be written from a customer perspective, as given in the Table 2-4 example. For example,
                                 regarding the “product/service” component, the charter fishing company provides “memories
                                 for a lifetime”—thus revealing the “utility” of the service offered and appealing to people who
                                 may not like to “just fish.” Regarding the “distinctive competence” component, whereby the
                                 firm reveals the major competitive advantage its products/services provide, the statement says:
                                 “for customer enjoyment and safety, we provide the most experienced staff in the industry.” A
                                 concise, inspiring, exemplary mission statement that could be derived from the component-by-
                                 component example shown in Table 2-4 follows.

                                    Our fleet of fast, clean deep sea fishing boats (products) offers outdoor ­enthusiasts
                                    (customers) an exciting fishing adventure off the coast of North Carolina (markets). Using
                                    the latest safety and fishing finding equipment (technology), as well as emission-friendly

                                    the industry (distinctive competence). Ensuring that ­customers “catch rather than just
                                    fish,” our staff of experienced captains and first mates (employees) follows the Golden
                                    Rule (philosophy) and creates l­ifelong memories for customers, all while charging the
                                    lowest possible prices and f­ostering repeat customers (survival, growth, profitability).

               Regarding the “survival, growth, and profitability” component, for publicly held firms, share-
               holders often expect at least a 4 percent annual growth in revenues because otherwise individuals
               could redirect their money to achieve this rate of growth (usually) in the stock market. Regarding
               the “philosophy” component, CEO Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook recently condensed his com-
               pany’s mission statement to focus only on the “philosophy” component, as revealed in Ethics

               The Importance (Benefits) of Vision and Mission                                                                  LO 2.7
               Statements
               A meta-analysis of 20 years of empirical research on mission statements concluded there is a
               positive relationship between mission statements and measures of financial performance.7 In
               actual practice, wide variations exist in the nature, composition, and use of both vision and mis-
               sion statements. King and Cleland recommend that organizations carefully develop a written
               mission statement to reap the following benefits:
                   1. To make sure all employees/managers understand the firm’s purpose or reason for being.
                   2. To provide a basis for prioritization of key internal and external factors utilized to formu-
                      late feasible strategies.
                   3. To provide a basis for the allocation of resources.
                   4. To provide a basis for organizing work, departments, activities, and segments around a
                      common purpose.8
                   Another benefit of developing a comprehensive mission statement is that divergent views
               among managers can be uncovered and resolved through the process. The question “What is
               our business?” can create controversy. Raising the question often reveals differences among

    80    PART 2 • STRATEGY FORMULATION

                                 strategists in the organization. Individuals who have worked together for a long time and who
                                 think they know each other suddenly may realize that they are in fundamental disagreement.
                                 For example, in a college or university, divergent views among faculty regarding the relative
                                 importance of teaching, research, and service often are expressed during the development of
                                 the mission statement. Negotiation, compromise, and eventual agreement on important issues
                                 are needed before people in any organization or company can focus on more specific strategy-
                                 formulation activities.
                                      Considerable disagreement among an organization’s strategists over vision and mission
                                 statements can cause trouble if not resolved. For example, unresolved disagreement over the
                                 business mission was one of the reasons for W. T. Grant’s bankruptcy and eventual liquidation.
                                 Top executives of the firm, including Ed Staley and Lou Lustenberger, were firmly entrenched
                                 in opposing positions that W. T. Grant should be like Kmart or J. C. Penney, respectively. W. T.
                                 Grant decided to adopt attributes of both Kmart and J. C. Penney; this compromise was a huge
                                 strategic mistake. In other words, top executives of W. T. Grant never resolved their vision or
                                 mission issue, which ultimately led to the firm’s disappearance.9
                                      Too often, strategists develop vision and mission statements only when the organization is in
                                 trouble. Of course, the documents are needed then. Developing and communicating these state-
                                 ments during troubled times indeed may have spectacular results and may even reverse decline.
                                 However, to wait until an organization is in trouble to develop a vision and mission statement is
                                 a gamble that characterizes irresponsible management. According to Drucker, as indicated, the
                                 most important time to ask seriously, “What do we want to become?” and “What is our busi-
                                 ness?” is when a company has been successful:

                                    Success always obsoletes the very behavior that achieved it, always creates new realities,
                                    and always creates new and different problems. Only the fairy tale story ends, “They lived
                                    happily ever after.” It is never popular to argue with success or to rock the boat. It will not
                                    be long before success will turn into failure. Sooner or later, even the most successful an-
                                    swer to the question “What is our business?” becomes obsolete.10

                                       In multidivisional organizations, strategists should ensure that divisional units perform
                                 s­trategic-management tasks (sometimes referred to as business-level strategy), including the
                                  development of a statement of vision and mission for their unique division. Each division should
                                  involve its own managers and employees in developing vision and mission statements that are
                                  consistent with and supportive of the corporate mission. The benefits of having a clear vision and
                                  mission are summarized in Table 2-5.
                                       An organization that fails to develop an effective vision and mission statement loses the
                                  opportunity to present itself favorably to existing and potential stakeholders. All organizations
                                  need customers, employees, and managers, and most firms need creditors, suppliers, and dis-
                                  tributors. Vision and mission statements are effective vehicles for communicating with important

               internal and external stakeholders. The principal benefit of these statements as tools of strategic
               management is derived from their specification of the ultimate aims of a firm. Vision and mission
               statements reveal the firm’s shared expectations internally among all employees and managers,
               and for external constituencies, reveal the firm’s long-term commitment to responsible, ethical
               action in providing a needed product or service to customers.

               The Process of Developing Vision and Mission Statements
               As many managers as possible should be involved in the process of developing these statements
               because, through involvement, people become committed to an organization. A widely used
               approach to developing vision and mission statements is first to select several articles (such as
               those listed as Current Readings at the end of this chapter) and ask all managers to read them as
               background information. Then, managers are asked to individually prepare vision and mission
               statements for the organization. A facilitator or committee of top managers should then merge
               these statements into a single document and distribute the draft statements to all managers.
               A request for modifications, additions, and deletions is needed next, along with a meeting to
               revise the document. To the extent that all managers have input into and support the final docu-
               ments, organizations can more easily obtain managers’ support for other strategy formulation,
               implementation, and evaluation activities. Thus, the process of developing vision and mission
               statements represents a great opportunity for strategists to obtain needed support from all manag-
               ers in the firm.
                    Some organizations use discussion groups of managers to develop and modify existing
               statements. Other organizations hire an outside consultant or facilitator to manage the process
               and help draft the language. At times an outside person with expertise in developing such state-
               ments, who has unbiased views, can manage the process more effectively than an internal group
               or committee of managers.
                    When an effective process is followed, developing a mission statement can create an “emo-
               tional bond” and “sense of mission” among employees and customers. Commitment to a com-
               pany’s strategy and intellectual agreement on the strategies to be pursued do not necessarily
               translate into an emotional bond; hence, strategies that have been formulated may not be imple-
               mented. An emotional bond comes when an individual personally identifies with the underlying
               values and behavior of a firm, thus turning intellectual agreement and commitment to strategy
               into a sense of mission. Involving marketers and sales representatives in the development of the
               mission statement and writing statements from a customer perspective could enable firms to cre-
               ate an emotional bond with customers and enhance the likelihood that salespersons would be “on
               a mission” to provide excellent customer service.



               Evaluating and Writing Mission Statements                                                             LO 2.8
               A mission statement should provide more than mere inclusion of a single word such as products
               or employees regarding a respective component. Why? Because the statement should motivate
               stakeholders to action, as well as be customer-oriented, informative, inspiring, and enduring.
                    Perhaps the best way to develop a skill for writing and evaluating mission statements is to
               study actual company missions. Thus, Table 2-6 provides a component-by-component critique
               of an actual mission statement from Hershey. The Hershey statement is too brief, being only

                    As additional guidance for practitioners (and students), mission statements are written from
               a customer perspective and proposed for four companies as presented in Table 2-7. The state-
               ments include the 10 characteristics and 9 components presented previously. The statements are
               written to enhance customer satisfaction, especially if communicated to customers by market-
               ers, and backed by company commitment to and implementation of the mission message. The
               proposed statement for the footwear company Crocs, Inc., for example, talks about “dependable
               and lasting comfort all day,” whereas the UPS proposed statement talks about “the most timely,
               dependable, and accurate delivery times in the world.”

                                         Chapter Summary
                                         Every organization has a unique purpose and reason for being. This uniqueness should be re-
                                         flected in vision and mission statements. The nature of a business’ core values, vision, and mis-
                                         sion can represent either a competitive advantage or disadvantage for the firm. An organization
                                         achieves a heightened sense of purpose when strategists, managers, and employees develop and
                                         communicate clear core values, vision, and mission. Drucker says that developing a clear busi-
                                         ness vision and mission is the “first responsibility of strategists.”
                                              A quality mission statement reveals an organization’s customers; products or services; mar-
                                         kets; technology; concern for survival, growth, and profitability; philosophy; distinctive com-
                                         petence; concern for public image; and concern for employees. These nine basic components
                                         serve as a practical framework for evaluating and writing mission statements. As the first step
                                         in strategic management, the vision and mission statements provide direction for all planning
                                         activities. As indicated next in the mini-case, even Under Armour’s vision and mission state-
                                         ments can be improved.
                                              Well-designed vision and mission statements are essential for formulating, implementing,
                                         and evaluating strategy. Developing and communicating a clear business vision and mission
                                         are the most commonly overlooked tasks in strategic management. Without clear statements
                                         of vision and mission, a firm’s short-term actions can be counterproductive to long-term in-
                                         terests. Vision and mission statements always should be subject to revision, but, if carefully
                                         prepared, they will require infrequent major changes. Vision and mission statements should
                                         serve as guidance and be reviewed often when divergent views arise among managers on vari-
                                         ous strategies to implement. Organizations usually reexamine their vision and mission state-
                                         ments annually. Effective vision and mission statements stand the test of time.
                                              Core values, vision, and mission statements are essential tools for strategists—a fact illus-

               Develop a Vision and Mission Statement for Yourself
               Purpose
               A personal vision and mission statement can be helpful to an individual in job-related decisions and career
               paths. This exercise will give you practice developing and writing vision and mission statements from a per-
               sonal perspective. For most college students nearing graduation, it is nearly inevitable to be faced with em-
               ployability decisions. Developing vision and mission statements compels an individual to think about the
               nature and scope of their skills and abilities and to assess the potential attractiveness of future job opportunities
               and activities. These statements broadly chart the future direction of a person’s life and serve as a motivating
               force and constant reminder of why the individual continuously gets up in the morning and works hard.

                                 What Is the Relative Importance of Each
                                 of the Nine Components of a Mission Statement?
                                 Purpose
                                 Research reveals that a mission statement should include all nine components to be most effective. For
                                 some companies or organizations, some components may be more important to include than others. Based
                                 on their experience, this exercise reveals the authors’ ranking of the relative importance of nine mission
                                 recommended components for inclusion in an exemplary statement.
                                     The purpose of this exercise is to examine how well students understand the components of a
                                 mission statement. In addition, the purpose of this exercise is to examine whether individual decision
                                 making is better than group decision making. Academic research suggests that groups make better
                                 decisions than individuals about 80 percent of the time.
                                 Instructions
                                 Rank the nine mission statement components as to their relative importance (1 = most important, 9 = least
                                 important). First, rank the components as an individual. Then, rank the components as part of a group of
                                 three. Thus, determine what person(s) and what group(s) here today can come closest to the expert ranking.
                                 This exercise enables examination of the relative effectiveness of individual versus group decision making
                                 in strategic planning.
                                 Steps
                                  1. Fill in Column 1 in Table 2-8 to reveal your individual ranking of the relative importance of the nine
                                     components (1 = most important, to 9 = least important, etc.). For example, if you feel the Customer
                                     component is the fifth-most important, then enter a 5 in Table 1 in Column 1 beside Customers.
                                  2. Fill in Column 2 in Table 2-8 to reveal your group’s ranking of the relative importance of the
                                     nine components (1 = most important, to 9 = least important, etc.).
                                  3. Fill in Column 3 in Table 2-8 to reveal the expert’s ranking of the nine components.

                   3 to reveal how well you performed as an individual in this exercise. (Note: Absolute difference

                6. Sum Column 4. Sum Column 5.
                7. Compare the Column 4 sum with the Column 5 sum. If your Column 4 sum is less than your
                   Column 5 sum, then you performed better as an individual than as a group. Normally, group
                   decision making is superior to individual decision making, so if you did better than your group,
                   you did excellent.
                8. The Individual Winner(s): The individual(s) with the lowest Column 4 sum is the WINNER.
                9. The Group Winners(s): The group(s) with the lowest Column 5 score is the WINNER.

               AND MISSION FOR THE PRESENT
               Headquartered in Dearborn, Michigan, Ford is the second-largest U.S. automobile maker, behind
               General Motors, and the fifth-largest automobile maker globally. Ford is considering changing its
               vision and mission because of electric vehicles gaining such rapid prominence worldwide. The
               company foresees a day soon across the United States where you pull up at any gas station and
               either gas up or plug in to get charged up. Ford is behind nearly all automakers in electric product
               offerings and is losing ground. This gas up or plug in scenario already exists in some parts of the
               world. Ford’s survival going forward may hinge on an assessment of the company’s vision and
               mission statements.

               Current Vision Statement
               People working together as a lean, global enterprise to make lives better through automotive and mo-

                                        Questions
                                         1. In what three ways is Ford’s proposed vision statement better than the firm’s actual vision
                                            ­statement? Does the current or proposed statement meet the 5-out-of-5 test? If not, prepare a new
                                             statement.
                                         2. Evaluate the extent that the proposed mission statement for Ford meets the 10 characteristics
                                             and includes the 9 components presented in the chapter.

                                                         ompanies and organizations continually deal with external uncertainties and must
                                                         quickly adapt to change to survive, as indicated in the following story:

                                                       Once there were two company presidents who competed in the same ­industry.
                                                       These two presidents decided to go on a camping trip to discuss a possible
                                                       ­merger. They hiked deep into the woods. Suddenly, they came upon a grizzly
                                                        bear that rose up on its hind legs and snarled. Instantly, the first president took off
                                                        his ­knapsack and got out a pair of jogging shoes. The second president said, “Hey,
                                                        you can’t outrun that bear.” The first president responded, “Maybe I can’t outrun
                                                        that bear, but I surely can outrun you!”

                                                As illustrated in Figure 3-1, this chapter focuses on the concepts and tools needed to manage
                                                external uncertainties by conducting an external audit (sometimes called industry analysis).
                                                An external audit focuses on identifying and evaluating trends and events beyond the control
                                                of a single firm, such as increased foreign competition, population shifts to coastal areas,
                                                an aging society, and a social-media revolution. An external audit reveals key opportunities
                                                and threats confronting an organization; an external audit guides managers in formulating
                                                ­strategies that take advantage of the opportunities and avoid or reduce the impact of threats.
                                                      This chapter presents a practical framework for gathering, assimilating, analyzing,
                                                 and prioritizing external information that provides a foundation for formulating strate-
                                                 gies effectively. Specifically, the first two-thirds of this chapter address external oppor-
                                                 tunity/threat areas in terms of what, where, how, and why to obtain this information;
                                                 the latter one-third of this chapter explains how to develop and use an External Factor

               The External Assessment Phase of Strategy Formulation                                                          LO 3.1
               The purpose of an external audit is to develop a finite list of both opportunities that could benefit a
               firm and threats that should be avoided or mitigated. As the term finite suggests, the external audit
               is not aimed at developing an exhaustive list of every possible factor that could influence the busi-
               ness; rather, it is aimed at identifying key variables that offer actionable responses. Firms should
               be able to respond either offensively or defensively to the factors by formulating strategies that
               capitalize on external opportunities or that minimize the impact of potential threats. Figure 3-1
               illustrates with white shading how the external audit fits into the strategic-management process.

               Key External Forces
               There are 10 external forces that can be divided into 5 broad categories: (1) economic forces;
               (2) social, cultural, demographic, and environment (SCDE) forces; (3) political, governmen-
               tal, and legal forces; (4) technological forces; and (5) competitive forces. Relationships among
               these forces and an organization are depicted in Figure 3-2. External trends and events, such
               as increasing security concerns surrounding big data, changing consumer demand surrounding
               authenticity and personalization, and people in developing countries learning about online ser-
               vices, significantly affect products, services, markets, and organizations worldwide.

               The Actionable-Quantitative-Comparative-Divisional (AQCD) Test
               When identifying and prioritizing key external factors in strategic planning, make sure the fac-
               tors selected meet the following four criteria to the extent possible:
                   1. Actionable (i.e., meaningful and helpful in ultimately deciding what actions or strategies a
                      firm should consider pursuing);
                   2. Quantitative (i.e., include percentages, ratios, dollars, and numbers to the extent possible);
                   3. Comparative (i.e., reveals changes over time), and
                   4. Divisional (relates to the firm’s products and/or regions (rather than consolidated) so infer-
                      ences can be drawn regarding what products and regions are doing well or not).
                    Factors that meet the four criteria described above pass what can be called the “Actionable-
               Quantitative-Comparative-Divisional (AQCD) Test,” which is a measure of the quality of an external
               factor. In addition to passing the AQCD Test, make sure that external factors are indeed external (not
               internal), and make sure that external factors, particularly opportunities, are stated as external trends,
               events, or facts, rather than being stated as strategies the firm could pursue. Also, make sure the external

                                          factors relate closely to the firm achieving its mission (opportunities) or hindering its mission (threats).
                                          Factors selected for inclusion in an external assessment should be mission-driven.
                                               Regarding the AQCD criteria, strive to include all high quality factors in an external assess-
                                          ment for a firm. A high quality factor will meet three or four of the AQCD criteria; a low quality
                                          factor will meet two or fewer of the AQCD criteria. When performing an external assessment,
                                          engage in an engineering hunt for facts to make sure as many factors as possible pass the AQCD
                                          Test. It is important to state external factors to the extent possible in actionable, quantitative,
                                          comparative, and divisional terms.

                                                 greatly in 2018.


                                               Changes in external forces translate into changes in demand for both industrial and con-
                                          sumer goods and services. External forces affect the types of products developed, the nature of
                                          market segmentation and positioning strategies, the range of services offered, and the choice of
                                          businesses to acquire or sell. External forces have a direct impact on both suppliers and distribu-
                                          tors. Identifying and evaluating external opportunities and threats enables organizations to revise
                                          their vision and mission if needed, to design strategies to achieve long-term objectives, and to
                                          develop policies to achieve annual objectives.


                                 LO 3.2   10 External Forces that Impact Organizations
                                          Economic Forces
                                          Economic factors have a direct impact on the potential attractiveness of various strategies. An
                                          example of an economic variable is “value of the dollar,” which can have a significant effect on
                                          financial results of companies with global operations. Domestic firms with significant overseas
                                          sales, such as McDonald’s, are hurt by a strong dollar. If the dollar appreciates 10 percent relative
                                          to the local currency of a particular country in which a U.S. company has $100 million in r­ evenues,
                                          that company’s revenues would decrease by $10 million as they are translated into U.S. dollars. For
                                          foreign firms with relatively large U.S. sales, however, a strong dollar provides a boost. A strong
                                          dollar enables U.S. firms to purchase raw materials more cheaply from other countries. However, in
                                          early 2018, the value of the dollar was near a 3-year low versus foreign currencies.
                                               Favorable economic conditions recently bode well for many firms because economic growth
                                          typically reduces unemployment, boosts consumer confidence, and increases disposable income.
                                          The World Economic Outlook report, published by the International Monetary Fund, predicts a
                                          broad-based global acceleration in the world economy; small, but wide-spanning growth (around
                                          3.6 percent) is expected among most major economies in 2018–2021.1
                                               A few categories of economic variables that often yield AQCD opportunities and threats for
                                          organizations are provided in Table 3-1. In doing strategic planning or case analysis, economic
                                          factors must be stated in AQCD terms to the extent possible to be useful in strategic planning.

               Social, Cultural, Demographic, and Environment (SCDE) Forces
               SCDE forces impact strategic decisions on virtually all products, services, markets, and custom-
               ers. Small, large, for-profit, and nonprofit organizations in all industries are being staggered
               and challenged by the opportunities and threats arising from changes in SCDE variables. These
               forces are shaping the way people live, work, produce, and consume. New trends are creating a
               shift in consumer demands and, consequently, a need for different products, new services, and
               updated strategies. For example, consumers in the United States now desire automobiles with
               greater space and utility, in lieu of sedans. In response to this external trend, Ford Motor recently
               invested $7 billion in higher-margin trucks and SUVs and announced plans to reintroduce the
               Ranger Trust and the Bronco SUV in North America.2
                    In the U.S. food industry, demand for processed packaged foods is declining because con-
               sumers are showing increased preferences for freshly prepared food options. Packaged food
               companies such as Kellogg are trying to quickly adapt to mitigate this external threat; Kellogg
               recently hired a new CEO, Steven Cahillane, who comes with extensive experience leading the
               health and wellness company, Nature’s Bounty.
                    Consumer tastes and trends constantly change; people wander through stores less, opt-
               ing increasingly to use their mobile phones and computers to research prices and cherry-pick
               promotions. Brick-and-mortar retail department stores consequently are struggling as consum-
               ers increasingly turn to online retailers and smaller specialty stores. These external trends have
               prompted many retail chains to slow or cease store openings.3
                    The United States (and the world) is also becoming older. Individuals age 65 and older in the
               United States, as a percentage of the population, will rise to 19 percent by 2030. The trend toward
               an older society is good news for restaurants, hotels, airlines, cruise lines, tours, travel services,
               pharmaceutical firms, automakers, and funeral homes. Older people are especially interested in
               health care, financial services, travel, crime prevention, and leisure. The aging population affects
               the strategic orientation of nearly all organizations.
                    Example categories of SCDE variables that often yield AQCD opportunities and threats for
               organizations are given in Table 3-2. In performing strategic planning and case analysis, rele-
               vant SCDE factors must be stated in AQCD terms to the extent possible to be useful in strategic
               planning.

               Political, Governmental, and Legal Forces
               Politics, governments, and legislators can and often do impact strategic decisions. Federal, state,
               local, and foreign governments are major regulators, deregulators, subsidizers, employers, and
               customers of organizations. Political, governmental, and legal factors, therefore, can represent
               major opportunities or threats for both small and large organizations. For industries and firms
               that depend heavily on government contracts or subsidies, political forecasts can be the most
               important part of an external audit. State and local income taxes and property taxes, for example,

                                          impact where companies locate facilities and where people desire to live. Nine U.S. states, for
                                          example, have zero state income tax: Alaska, Florida, Nevada, South Dakota, Texas, Washington,
                                          Wyoming, New Hampshire, and Tennessee.
                                               Governmental legislation can significantly impact where businesses sell their products. For
                                          example, rapidly developing shifts in legislation surrounding the legality of marijuana are open-
                                          ing new markets for investors. Nearly a decade ago, Colorado passed the world’s first legislation
                                          that would treat marijuana like alcohol, taxing and regulating its sales. U.S. consumers spent
                                          $6.7 billion on legal marijuana in 2016; this number is expected to reach $208 billion in 2021.
                                               Example categories of political, governmental, and legal variables that often yield AQCD
                                          opportunities and threats to organizations are provided in Table 3-3. Political, governmental,
                                          and legal factors must be stated in AQCD terms to the extent possible to be useful in strate-
                                          gic planning. Local, state, and federal laws, as well as regulatory agencies and special-interest
                                          groups, can have a major impact on the strategies of small, large, for-profit, and nonprofit orga-
                                          nizations. Many companies have altered or ­abandoned strategies in the past because of politi-
                                          cal or governmental actions. As indicated in Ethics Capsule 3, new pending federal legislation
                                          regarding Alaska oil drilling could create ­business opportunities and threats and present ethical
                                          dilemma issues.

               Technological Forces
               A variety of new technologies such as the Internet of Things, three-dimensional (3D) printing,
               predictive analytics, quantum computing, robotics, and artificial intelligence are fueling innova-
               tion in many industries and impacting strategic-planning decisions. Businesses are using mobile
               technologies and applications to better determine customer trends and are employing advanced
               analytics to make enhanced strategy decisions. The vast increase in the amount of data coming
               from mobile devices and social-media sites is astonishing. A primary reason that Cisco Systems
               recently entered the data analytics business is that sales of hardware, software, and services con-
               nected to the Internet of Things is expected to increase to $7.1 billion by 2020 from approximately
               $2.0 billion in 2015. A recent report by Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp., an IT services and
               consulting firm, predicts that more than 20 new job categories are soon to emerge from techno-
               logical advances.
                    Online retail is crushing traditional retail. Credit Suisse reports that more U.S. brick-and-
               mortar retail stores closed in 2017 than in the 2008 economic recession. U.S. online retail sales
               increased a whopping 24 percent in 2017, as consumers prefer having boxes delivered to their door.
               This technological trend is so pervasive that Walmart Stores, Inc. in 2018 changed their name to
               Walmart, Inc.—removing the word stores. In fact, in terms of online selling of groceries, Walmart
               is the leader in China, even though there are more than four hundred Walmart stores in China.
                    Advances in technology impact the manufacturing labor market. Ben Pring, Director of
               Cogniant’s Center for the Future of Work estimates that nearly 19 million jobs in the United
               States will become obsolete or be replaced by automation in the next 15 years.4 In a dramatic
               shift from employing people with low wages outside of the United States, Adidas is shifting
               to produce footwear in developed countries using fully robotic plants called “speed-factories.”
               Adidas’s speed-­factories are now located across the world, including in Germany, the United
               States, France, China, and Japan. This shift from cheap manpower to complete automation is a
               technological revolution occurring in the footwear industry. Before new speed-factories, Adidas
               owned no factories, instead using more than one thousand suppliers that employ millions of
               people to assemble shoes at low-wage facilities globally. Adidas’ new strategy aims to eventually
               surpass its major rival Nike.
                    No company or industry today is insulated against emerging technological developments. In high-
               tech industries, identification and evaluation of key technological opportunities and threats can be the
               most important part of the external strategic-management audit. In performing an external assessment,
               technology-related factors must be stated in AQCD terms to the extent possible to be useful in strategic
               planning. Technological advancements impact firms in countless ways, such as the following:
                   1. They can dramatically affect organizations’ products, services, markets, suppliers, distribu-
                      tors, competitors, customers, manufacturing processes, marketing practices, and competi-
                      tive position.
                   2. They can create new markets, result in a proliferation of new and improved products,
                      change the relative competitive cost positions in an industry, and render existing products
                      and services obsolete.
                   3. They can reduce or eliminate cost barriers between businesses, create shorter production
                      runs, create shortages in technical skills, and result in changing values and expectations of
                      employees, managers, and customers.
                   4. They can create new competitive advantages that are more powerful than existing
                      advantages.

    100    PART 2 • STRATEGY FORMULATION

                                       A chief information officer (CIO) and chief technology officer (CTO) are common
                                  positions in firms today, reflecting the growing importance of information technology (IT)
                                  in strategic management. A CIO and CTO work together to ensure that information needed to
                                  formulate, implement, and evaluate strategies is available on demand. The CIO is primarily a
                                  manager, managing the firm’s relationship with stakeholders; the CTO is primarily a technician,
                                  focusing on technical issues such as data acquisition, data processing, decision-support systems,
                                  and software and hardware acquisition.
                                       Monitoring online reviews for businesses, large or small, has become a burdensome but
                                  essential task, especially given social-media channels, such as Twitter, that empowers opinionated
                                  customers. Benign neglect of a company’s online reputation can quickly hurt sales, e­ specially
                                  given the new normal behavior of customers consulting their smartphones for even the smallest
                                  of purchases.


                                  Competitive Forces
                                  Arguably the most important part of an external audit is identifying rival firms and deter-
                                  mining their strengths, weaknesses, capabilities, objectives, and strategies. George Salk
                                  stated, “If you’re not faster than your competitor, you’re in a tenuous position, and if you’re
                                  only half as fast, you’re terminal.” As indicated in Global Capsule 3, Netflix is faster than
                                  its rival firms but staying ahead requires constant monitoring of what those firms are doing
                                  and why. Go to www.owler.com for information about competitors.
                                        Competition in virtually all industries is intense—and sometimes cutthroat. Within the
                                  smartphone and personal tech industry, for example, GoPro Inc. is struggling to maintain market
                                  share. To differentiate its offerings from the latest smartphone camera technologies offered by
                                  Apple and Samsung, GoPro developed a new product called Fusion that features a 360-degree
                                  spherical camera with a unique Over-Capture capability, enabling users to capture pictures from
                                  every angle simultaneously.
                                        Addressing questions about competitors, such as those presented in Table 3-4, is essential in

                                  of Competitive Intelligence Professionals (SCIP), is a systematic and ethical process for gather-

                                   •   Conduct fly-over and drive-by visits to rival firm operations.
                                   •   Search online databases and websites such as www.owler.com.
                                   •   Contact government agencies for public information about rival firms.

                   What Company Is Growing Fastest Globally?
                   The answer to the question posed may be Netflix,                                               movie- and video-streaming services instead of

                     Information gathering from employees, managers, suppliers, distributors, customers, creditors,
               and consultants can make the difference between having superior or just average intelligence and
               overall competitiveness. All members of an organization—from the CEO to custodians—are valuable
               intelligence agents for the firm. Special characteristics of a successful CI program include flexibility,
               usefulness, timeliness, and cross-functional cooperation. CI is not corporate espionage. Unethical tac-
               tics such as bribery, wiretapping, and computer hacking should never be used to obtain information.
               Due to cybersecurity threats, CI must assure however that persons in a firm cannot access data and
               information unrelated to their job description because hackers exploit this avenue in firms.

               Porter’s Five-Forces Model                                                                                                          LO 3.3
               Harvard Business School Professor, Michael Porter, suggests that firms should strive to compete
               in attractive industries, avoid weak or faltering industries, and gain a full understanding of key
               external factors within that attractive industry. Given that competitive positioning within an indus-
               try is a key determinant of competitive advantage, Porter established the Five-Forces Model.
                    One of the major contributions of Porter’s work is he shifted focus away from viewing com-
               petition directed toward a few rival firms to a broader analysis that includes forces from current
               competitors, new competitors, substitute products, suppliers, and buyers. Competitive advantage
               can be created in each area of the five forces by offering value to the consumer that exceeds cost.
               Rather than focusing solely on a top competitor, it is important that firms examine how suppliers
               and others listed in the five forces are trying to siphon off as much value as possible in all busi-
               ness transactions.
                    Porter’s Model is also used to determine which industries to enter because generally the
               stronger the five forces are, the less profitable the industry. Porter is an advocate of external vari-
               ables rather than internal ones being a larger driver of competitive advantage, similar to a rising
               or falling tide; it is difficult to overcome a rising tide no matter your internal capabilities. Porter’s
               Model also prompts managers to focus on the medium- and longer-term factors that determine

                                          pundits on TV to explain slow Christmas sales. It is not that short-term factors are not important
                                          or have no impact, but they simply do not affect competition to the degree that long-term factors
                                          do, as revealed in the Five-Forces Model.
                                               As illustrated in Figure 3-3, the Porter’s Five-Forces Model offers guidance to strategists in
                                          formulating strategies to keep rival firms at bay. According to Porter, the nature of competitive-
                                          ness in a given industry can be viewed as a composite of five forces:
                                            1.   Rivalry among competing firms
                                            2.   Potential entry of new competitors
                                            3.   Potential development of substitute products
                                            4.   Bargaining power of suppliers
                                            5.   Bargaining power of consumers

                                          Rivalry among Competing Firms
                                          Rivalry among competing firms is usually the most powerful of the five competitive forces
                                          and the most traditional factor analyzed by managers. It is also the only factor most affected
                                          by changes in the other four factors. Strategies pursued by one firm can be successful only
                                          to the extent that they provide competitive advantage over the strategies pursued by rival
                                          firms. Intense rivalry among competitors in an industry can decrease overall industry profits
                                          because firms often lower prices or spend extra on advertising to maintain market share, often
                                          transferring profits directly to consumers and other players in the Five-Forces Model. Rivalry
                                          among competing firms increases for numerous reasons as given in Table 3-5, including an
                                          increase in the number of competitors and a shift towards competitors becoming more equal
                                          in size and capability.
                                               As rivalry among competing firms intensifies, industry profits decline, in some cases to
                                          the point where an industry becomes inherently unattractive. Changes in strategy by one firm
                                          may be met with retaliatory countermoves, such as lowering prices, enhancing quality, adding
                                          features, providing services, extending warranties, and increasing advertising—especially
                                          when a firm senses weakness from another. Although avoiding high-rivalry industries would
                                          be ideal, that is often easier said than done. At times it may be best to look for an industry
                                          with more favorable five forces and reduced rivalry, but firms can also compete within a
                                          similar or sub-industry by offering products targeting different customer groups with dif-
                                          ferentiated products. Offering differentiation helps all firms in the industry by m

                                          from competing on cost, where unique customers can be better served while maintaining
                                          profits for firms.

               Potential Entry of New Competitors
               Whenever new firms can easily enter a particular industry, existing firms are likely to face threats
               of reduced market share. In such industries, a firm’s strategies should deter new firms from enter-
               ing the market to avoid further saturation of the market. Example barriers to entry can include
               economies of scale, specialized know-how, strong brand reputation, established customer loyalty,
               high capital requirements, absolute cost advantages, highly efficient supply chains, specialized
               distribution channels, access to key raw materials, and possession of patents. The automotive
               oil-change industry, for example, has relatively low barriers to entry; whereas the smartphone
               industry has much higher barriers to entry.
                    Despite numerous barriers to entry, new firms sometimes enter industries with higher-quality
               products, lower prices, and substantial marketing resources. When the threat of new firms enter-
               ing the market is strong, incumbent firms generally fortify their positions and take swift actions
               to deter new entrants, such as lowering prices, extending warranties, adding features, or offer-
               ing financing specials. Even the threat of new entrants can increase rivalry and thus reduce
               profitability.

               Potential Development of Substitute Products
               In many industries, firms are in close competition with producers of substitute products in other
               industries. Examples are beer, wine, and liquor; public transportation and car, bike, and taxi/
               Uber; natural gas, electricity, and solar power; glass bottles, paperboard containers, and alumi-
               num cans. A high threat of substitutes exists when consumer needs can easily be filled by one
               or more substitute products outside of the firm’s industry. Competitive pressures arising from
               substitute products increase as the relative price of substitute products decline and as consumers’
               costs of switching decrease.
                    The presence of substitute products puts a ceiling on the price that can be charged before
               consumers will switch to the substitute product. Price ceilings equate to profit ceilings and more
               intense competition among rivals. Producers of eyeglasses and contact lenses, for example, face
               increasing competitive pressures from laser eye surgery. Producers of sugar face similar pres-
               sures from artificial sweeteners. Newspapers and magazines face substitute-product competitive
               pressures from the Internet and 24-hour cable television. Substitute products can also come from
               places not normally expected. For example, a diamond producer may not consider a honeymoon
               package as a substitute for a less expensive ring. The bottom line with this “force” is that strate-
               gists must manage the potential threat of substitute products.

               Bargaining Power of Suppliers
               The bargaining power of suppliers refers to the ability of suppliers to raise the price of any inputs
               into the industry. This “force” affects the intensity of competitiveness in an industry, especially
               when there are few substitutes available for the product offered by suppliers, when the cost of
               switching to an alternative product offered by a different supplier is high, when the industry is
               not a key source of the supplier’s revenues, or when there are few suppliers.

    104    PART 2 • STRATEGY FORMULATION

                                       In some cases, firms pursue a backward-integration strategy to compete with suppliers. This
                                  strategy is especially effective when suppliers are unreliable, too costly, not capable of meeting
                                  a firm’s needs on a consistent basis, or simply have too much bargaining power and are able to
                                  charge absorbent prices. Boeing and Airbus, the two largest jetliner manufacturers, are beginning
                                  to make a portion of the parts that go into planes because both firms determined too high of a
                                  proportion industry profitability was going to suppliers. A key lesson for suppliers is that if your
                                  customer has the means to backward-integrate, it may be best to renegotiate prices.
                                       Overall, firms are in a better position when numerous suppliers exist. It is often in the best
                                  interest of both suppliers and producers to assist each other with reasonable prices, improved
                                  quality, development of new services, just-in-time deliveries, and reduced inventory costs, thus
                                  enhancing long-term profitability for all concerned. In more and more industries, sellers are forg-
                                  ing strategic partnerships with select suppliers in an effort to (1) reduce inventory and logistics
                                  costs, (2) accelerate the availability of next-generation components, (3) reduce defect rates, and
                                  (4) squeeze out important cost savings for both themselves and their suppliers.5


                                  Bargaining Power of Consumers
                                  Bargaining power of buyers refers to the ability of buyers to drive down prices for products
                                  offered by companies in a given industry. This force is strong when firms operate in industries
                                  that contain a limited number of buyers or that are made up of buyers that have multiple choices
                                  of where to buy from; this force is also strong when buyers purchase in volume or have low
                                  switching costs. Consumers (buyers) gain bargaining power under the following circumstances:
                                   1.   If they can inexpensively switch to competing brands or substitutes
                                   2.   If they are particularly important to the seller
                                   3.   If sellers are struggling in the face of falling consumer demand
                                   4.   If they are informed about sellers’ products, prices, and costs
                                   5.   If they have discretion in whether and when they purchase the product6
                                       The impact of this “force” on industry competitiveness is higher when the products being
                                  purchased are standard or undifferentiated, enabling consumers to negotiate selling price, war-
                                  ranty coverage, and accessory packages to a greater extent. Rival firms may offer extended war-
                                  ranties or special services to gain customer loyalty whenever the bargaining power of consumers
                                  is substantial. New car buyers, for example, often compare prices of their desired car across
                                  several dealerships, often negotiating lower prices and additional services from dealerships in
                                  exchange for their business.
                                       As a result of Porter’s Five Forces, the intensity of competition among firms varies
                                  widely across industries. Table 3-6 reveals the average operating profit for firms in different
                                  industries. Note substantial variation among industries, with the lowest being for bookstores.
                                  The collective impact of competitive forces is so brutal in some industries that the market is

               clearly “unattractive” from a profit-making standpoint. Strategists must continually monitor
               the five forces to identify new opportunities and threats facing the firm, and alter strategies
               accordingly.
                    Eliminating competition is a possibility and common strategy employed by firms in an indus-
               try with high rivalry. Firms use mergers and acquisitions and purchase suppliers or buyers (dis-
               tributors) all as a means to eliminate rivalry, but there are problems associated with this level of
               thinking. Acquiring the competition often is associated with paying a premium and dealing with
               different organizational cultures; although there may be no competitors currently, new competitors
               may enter with different products and ultimately better serve many current customers. Purchasing
               suppliers or distributors takes a firm away from the business they do best, possibly allowing com-
               petitors to better develop and improve their products without being bogged down with supply chain
               issues they know little about.
                    Several pitfalls firms should avoid when using the Five Forces Analysis, include (1) placing
               equal weight on all five forces instead of identifying the most pressing forces for their industry,
               (2) defining the industry too broad or too narrow, and (3) using the five forces to pin labels such as
               attractive or unattractive on an industry rather than using the model to more efficiently formulate
               strategies. When using Porter’s Five Forces Model as an external assessment tool in doing strategic
               planning, strive to identify AQCD opportunities and threats most important for success in a given
               industry, and most relevant to the firm’s vision and mission.


               Key Sources of Information for an External Audit                                                           LO 3.4
               A wealth of strategic information is available to organizations from both published and unpub-
               lished sources. Unpublished sources include customer surveys, market research, speeches at pro-
               fessional and shareholders’ meetings, television programs, interviews, and conversations with
               stakeholders. Published sources of strategic information include periodicals, journals, reports,
               government documents, abstracts, books, directories, newspapers, and manuals. A company
               website is usually an excellent place to start to find information about a firm, particularly on the
               Investor Relations web pages.
                    There are many excellent websites for gathering strategic information, but six outstanding
               ones that the authors use routinely in performing an external audit are:

                   1.   http://finance.yahoo.com
                   2.   www.hoovers.com
                   3.   www.morningstar.com
                   4.   www,mergentonline.com
                   5.   http://globaledge.msu.edu/industries/
                   6.   Corporate website of companies

                     The fifth website listed is operated by Michigan State University and provides industry pro-
               files that are an excellent source for information, news, events, and statistical data for any industry.
               Most college libraries subscribe to excellent online business databases that can then be used free
               by students to gather information to perform a strategic-management case analysis. Simply ask
               your reference librarian. Some outstanding library database sources of external audit information
               are described in Table 3-7; the authors use all of these sources, especially S&P Net Advantage’s
               Industry Surveys and IBISWorld, to obtain AQCD external factors for inclusion in an external
               assessment. Note also in Table 3-7 the PrivCo source is helpful for obtaining information about
               privately held firms; use www.owler.com for information about rival firms.

               Forecasts are educated assumptions about future trends and events. Forecasting is a complex
               activity because of factors such as technological innovation, cultural changes, new products,
               improved services, stronger competitors, shifts in government priorities, changing social values,
               unstable economic conditions, and unforeseen events. Managers often must rely on published
               forecasts to effectively identify key external opportunities and threats.

                                  People eat expecting to be satisfied and nourished in the future. People sleep assuming that
                                  in the future they will feel rested. They invest energy, money, and time because they believe
                                  their efforts will be rewarded in the future. They build highways assuming that automobiles
                                  and trucks will need them in the future. Parents educate children on the basis of forecasts
                                  that they will need certain skills, attitudes, and knowledge when they grow up. The truth
                                  is we all make implicit forecasts throughout our daily lives. The question, therefore, is not
                                  whether we should forecast but rather how we can best forecast to enable us to move beyond
                                  our ordinarily unarticulated assumptions about the future. Can we obtain information and
                                  use it to make educated assumptions (forecasts) that better guide our current decisions and
                                  foster a more desirable future state of affairs? Assumptions must be made based on facts,
                                  figures, trends, and research. Strive for the firm’s assumptions to be more accurate than rival
                                  firms’ assumptions.
                                       No forecast is perfect; some are even wildly inaccurate. This fact accents the need for strate-
                                  gists to devote sufficient time and effort to study the underlying bases for published forecasts and
                                  to develop internal forecasts of their own. Key external opportunities and threats can be effec-
                                  tively identified only through good forecasts.

                                  Making Assumptions
                                  Planning would be impossible without assumptions. McConkey defines assumptions as the
                                  “best present estimates of the impact of major external factors, over which managers have
                                  little if any control, but which may exert a significant impact on performance or the ability to
                                  achieve desired results.”7 Strategists are faced with countless variables and imponderables that

               can be neither controlled nor predicted with 100 percent accuracy. Wild guesses should never
               be made in formulating strategies, but reasonable assumptions based on available information
               must always be made.
                    By identifying future occurrences that could have a major effect on the firm and by making
               reasonable assumptions about those factors, strategists can carry the strategic-management process
               forward. Assumptions are needed only for future trends and events that are most likely to have a
               significant effect on the company’s business. Based on the best information at the time, assumptions
               serve as checkpoints on the validity of strategies. If future occurrences deviate significantly from
               assumptions, strategists know that corrective actions may be needed. Firms that compile the best
               information generally make the most accurate assumptions, which can lead to major competitive
               advantages.


               The External Factor Evaluation Matrix                                                                   LO 3.6
               An External Factor Evaluation (EFE) Matrix allows strategists to summarize and evaluate
               economic, social, cultural, demographic, environmental, political, governmental, legal, techno-
               logical, and competitive information. The EFE Matrix provides an empirical assessment of how
               well a firm is handling external factors overall, including the firm’s effectiveness at capitalizing
               on opportunities and minimizing threats.

               Steps to Develop an EFE Matrix
               An EFE Matrix can be developed in five steps:

               Step 1: Develop a Full and Narrow List of Key External Factors
               Conduct research about the focal company using the resources listed in Table 3.7. Compile and
               organize information into two data sets, opportunities and threats, developing a full list of per-
               haps 50 to 100 opportunity and threat factors relevant to the 10 external areas described previ-
               ously. Include factors most important to your firm’s industry, vision, mission, and strategies,
               considering the five forces just discussed. Then, narrow your data sets down to 20 key external
               factors that include specifically 10 opportunities and 10 threats. (Note: We use 10 and 10 because
               organizations commonly use this breakdown and the template at www.strategyclub.com uses 10
               and 10). List opportunities first and then threats. Also, do not include strategies as opportunities,
               so for example, “to build two new manufacturing plants in Europe” is a strategy, not an oppor-
               tunity; there may be an underlying opportunity that could make that strategy reasonable, such as
               “eight European countries have repealed restrictions on the sale of generic drugs.”
                    Firms determine the most important 20 factors among a full list usually by rating the factors
               according to importance (1 = least important to 10 = most important) and consolidating the rat-
               ing data or by ranking the factors (1 = most important to 50 = least important) and consolidating
               the ranking data. Both methods will yield the 20 most important factors to include. The impor-
               tant point here is that companies (and students) never should include just the first 20 factors that
               come to mind. For example, someone recently included as a threat in his EFE Matrix that “a
               hurricane can come.” Ninety-nine percent of the time that factor should not be included in the
               matrix; instead, conduct research to identify external factors that relate to the firm’s vision, mis-
               sion, strategies, and competitive advantages.
                    When determining particular factors to include in an EFE Matrix, and when assigning
               weights and ratings (Step 2) focus on a narrow industry perspective. For example, for Spirit
               Airlines, the industry is discount airlines, rather than all airlines, and for Lamborghini, the
               industry is high-end sports cars, not simply automobiles. This narrow industry perspective is
               important to facilitate external factors being stated in terms that meet the AQCD Test discussed
               earlier.
                    In developing a list of key external factors, be mindful of the AQCD Test because vagueness
               in stating factors must be avoided; ­vagueness gives analysts no guidance in assigning weights
               or ratings in developing an EFE Matrix. Recall that Edward Deming said, “In God we trust.
               Everyone else bring data.” Include “actionable” factors as defined previously in this chapter.

    108    PART 2 • STRATEGY FORMULATION

                                  Step 2: Assign Weights to Key External Factors
                                  In developing an EFE Matrix, assign a weight that ranges from 0.01 (not important) to 1.0 (all-
                                  important) for each factor. The weight assigned to a given factor indicates the relative importance
                                  of the factor for being successful in the firm’s industry relative to other factors included in the
                                  EFE. For example, a factor receiving a weight of 0.06 is 200 percent more important than a factor
                                  receiving a weight of 0.02 for success in the industry. Regardless of whether a key factor for a
                                  particular firm is an opportunity or threat, factors considered to have the greatest affect on orga-
                                  nizational performance of all firms in a specific industry should be assigned the highest weights.
                                  The sum of all weights must equal 1.0. Do not try to even weights out to total 0.50 for opportuni-
                                  ties and 0.50 for threats. In fact, if rivalry is high in a given industry, as discussed in the Porter’s
                                  Five Forces section, then the sum of weights assigned to threats could be higher than the sum for
                                  opportunities. Weights are industry-based, not company-based. List opportunities from highest
                                  weight to lowest weight; do the same for threats.

                                  Step 3: Assign Ratings to Key External Factors
                                  In developing an EFE Matrix, assign a rating between 1 and 4 to each key external factor to
                                  indicate how effectively (or ineffectively) the firm’s strategies are responding to the opportunity
                                  or threat, where 4 = the response is superior, 3 = the response is above average, 2 = the response
                                  is average, and 1 = the response is poor. Both opportunities and threats can receive a rating of 1,
                                  2, 3, or 4 at any time. Ratings are based on the effectiveness of a firm’s strategies in capitalizing
                                  on opportunities or avoiding/mitigating threats. Ratings are company-based, not industry-based.
                                       Assignment of numerical values down the rating column in an EFE Matrix should be with
                                  consideration that companies carve out niches in industries that enable them to gain and sus-
                                  tain competitive advantages through effective strategies. These niches are most often based on
                                  capitalizing on some opportunities more effectively than rivals. This is not to say that threats
                                  are not important, they are; some threats can wipe a firm out. However, if a firm faces many
                                  opportunities, this is likely the result of effective strategies positioning the firm well, so higher
                                  ratings are often warranted for opportunities; higher ratings increase the total weighted score in
                                  an EFE Matrix.
                                       As an example, the luxury car maker Ferrari could receive a high rating on a price com-
                                  petitiveness external factor, even though their sports cars are expensive because price competi-
                                  tiveness is not a deciding factor (low weight) for customers in the luxury sports car industry.
                                  Thus, in assigning ratings, as with weights, consider a subset of the industry in make effective
                                  judgments.

                                  Step 4: Obtain Weighted Scores
                                  Along each row in an EFE Matrix, multiply the factor’s weight by its rating to determine a
                                  weighted score for each factor.

                                  Step 5: Obtain Total Weighted Score
                                  Sum the weighted scores to determine the total weighted score for the organization. Regardless
                                  of how many factors are included in an EFE Matrix, the total weighted score can range from a
                                  low of 1.0 to a high of 4.0, with the average score being 2.5. Total weighted scores well below
                                  2.5 characterize organizations that are weak at responding to external factors, implying that new
                                  strategies are likely needed and perhaps a new direction, new vision or mission. Total weighted
                                  scores well above 2.5 indicate a strong external position, whereby a continuation of current strat-
                                  egies may be prudent, being ever mindful that there is always room for improvement. A total
                                  weighted score of 3.5 for example indicates that an organization is responding in an outstand-
                                  ing way to existing opportunities and threats in its industry. In other words, the firm’s strat-
                                  egies effectively take advantage of existing opportunities and minimize the potential adverse
                                  effects of external threats. A total weighted score of 1.5 indicates that the firm’s strategies are not
                                  capitalizing on opportunities or avoiding external threats. Making “small” decisions regarding
                                  weights and ratings in matrices is essential for making effective big strategy decisions later in the
                                  ­strategic-planning process; for example, a billion dollars may be at stake in choosing a particular
                                   strategy over another to implement, and the EFE Matrix with its factors, weights, and ratings is
                                   helpful in making that type of choice.

               An Example EFE Matrix
               An example EFE Matrix is provided in Table 3-8 for a local 10-theater cinema complex. Observe
               in the table that the most important factor to being successful in this industry is “Trend toward
               healthy eating eroding concession sales,” as indicated by the 0.12 weight. Also note that the local
               cinema is doing excellent (received a rating of 4) in regard to its handling of two external factors,
               “TDB University is expanding 6 percent annually” and “Trend toward healthy eating eroding
               concession sales.” Perhaps the cinema is placing flyers on campus and also adding yogurt and
               healthy drinks to its concession menu.
                    Overall, the total weighted score of 2.58 is above the average (midpoint) of 2.5, so this cin-
               ema business is doing slightly above average taking advantage of the external opportunities and
               minimizing external threats facing the firm. There is definitely room for improvement, though,
               because the highest total weighted score would be 4.0. As indicated by ratings of 1, the business
               needs to capitalize more on the “Two new neighborhoods developing within 3 miles” opportu-
               nity and work to avoid the “movies rented from . . . Time Warner” threat.
                    An actual EFE Matrix for one of the largest U.S. grocery retailers, Kroger, is given in
               Table 3-9 on page 110. As shown, the most important external factor facing Kroger, as indicated
               by a weight of 0.10, deals with Amazon acquiring Whole Foods Market. Kroger’s key factors
               are listed in order from the most important (highest weight) to the least important. Notice how
               the factors largely meet the AQCD test. Recall that mathematically, 0.04 is 33 percent more
               important than 0.03, and a rating of 3 is 50 percent higher than a rating of 2. Small judgments
               regarding assignment of weights and ratings in matrices are vital for making effective larger
               decisions related to deployment of resources and money across regions and products.
                    Overall, the total weighted score of 3.03 is above the average (midpoint) of 2.5, indicat-
               ing that Kroger is doing pretty well at taking advantage of the external opportunities and
               minimizing the threats facing the firm. There is definitely room for improvement, though,
               because the highest total weighted score would be 4.0. The rating of 1 for “The National
               Retail Federation estimates an 8–12% U.S. e-commerce growth in the next year,” for exam-
               ple, suggests that Kroger should better capitalize on this opportunity, perhaps by expanding
               its online offerings.

                                  LO 3.7   The Competitive Profile Matrix
                                           The Competitive Profile Matrix (CPM) reveals how a focal firm compares to major competitors
                                           across a range of key factors. This comparative analysis provides important strategic information
                                           regarding a firm’s competitive advantages or disadvantages in a given industry. In determining
                                           what factors to include in a CPM, tailor the factors to the particular industry. For example, in the
                                           airline industry, such factors as on-time arrival, leg room in planes, and routes served are far better
                                           factors to include than merely including “quality of service” or “financial condition” as factors.
                                                Similar to an EFE, a CPM uses weights and total weighted scores, which quantify the
                                           importance of a given factor to the industry, as well as total weighted scores, which quantify
                                           how well a given firm is doing relative to the other two firms evaluated in the CPM. The key
                                           difference between a CPM and EFE is that a CPM compares firms and an EFE Matrix analyzes
                                           how a firm internally is responding to key external issues. Critical success factors include points

               of competitive advantage within an industry, as well as other factors that are crucial for a firm
               to succeed within a given industry; critical success factors in a CPM can include both internal
               and external issues. List critical success factors from highest weight to lowest weight in a CPM.
                    Weights in a CPM are industry-based and sum to 1.0. Ratings in a CPM are assigned to
               quantify how well a firm and its key competitors are performing on each critical success factor;
               ratings reveal the degree of effectiveness of the firm’s strategies. Assign a rating between 1 and
               4 to each key factor to indicate how effectively the firm’s current strategies respond to the fac-
               tor, where 4 = the response is superior, 3 = the response is above average, 2 = the response is
               average, and 1 = the response is poor. Ratings are company-based; weights are industry-based.
                    A sample CPM is provided in Table 3-10. In this example, the two most important factors
               to being successful in the industry are “advertising” and “global expansion,” as indicated by
               weights of 0.20. If there were no weight column in this analysis, note that each factor then would
               be equally important. Thus, including a weight column yields a more robust analysis because it
               enables the analyst to capture perceived or actual levels of importance. Note in Table 3-10 that
               Company 1’s strategies are responding in a superior fashion to “product quality,” as indicated
               by a rating of 4, whereas Company 2’s strategies are superior regarding “advertising.” Overall,
               Company 1’s strategies are responding best, as indicated by the total weighted score of 3.15 and
               Company 3 is responding worst. Never duplicate ratings in a row in a CPM; go ahead and make
               judgments or decisions as to appropriate ratings based on your research and knowledge of the
               focal firm and rival companies. (Note: The point of this example is to illustrate the mechanics of
               developing a CPM rather than having industry-specific factors.)
                    Other than the critical success factors listed in the sample CPM, factors often included in
               this analysis include breadth of product line, effectiveness of sales distribution, proprietary or
               patent advantages, location of facilities, production capacity and efficiency, experience, union
               relations, technological advantages, and e-commerce expertise. In generating the list of critical
               success factors, strive to include factors that differentiate firms within the industry (i.e., factors
               that determine competitive advantages).
                    Just because one firm receives a 3.20 overall total weighted score and another receives a 2.80
               in a CPM, it does not necessarily follow that the first firm is precisely 14.3 percent better than
               the second, but it does suggest that the first firm is performing better on the variables included in
               the CPM. Regarding weights in a CPM or EFE Matrix, be mindful that 0.08 is mathematically
               33 percent higher than 0.06, so even small differences can reveal important perceptions regarding
               the relative importance of various factors. The aim with numbers is to assimilate and evaluate
               information in a meaningful way that aids in decision making.

               is performing worst. Only 8 critical success factors are included for simplicity; in actuality, however,
               this is too few. The template asks that 12 factors be included and to tailor factors to a given industry.

                    IMPLICATIONS FOR STUDENTS

                   be mindful that gaining and sustaining competitive advantage is the     clude specific (AQCD) factors related to direct competitors, trends

                   weights and ratings (which, by the way, are critically important),       such as the following:
                   highlight various factors in light of where you are leading the firm.
                   Make it abundantly clear in your discussion how your firm, with          1. China recently established four free-trade zones allowing for-
                   your recommendations, can subdue rival firms or at least profitably         eign companies to establish operations in the country without
                   compete with them. Showcase during this part of your project the            having a Chinese partner; this may be an external threat because

                   rivals. Remember to be prescriptive, rather than descriptive, in the        tomobile industry.

                   narrative that accompanies quarterly reports is excellent.

                                           Chapter Summary
                                           Increasing turbulence in markets and industries around the world means the external audit has
                                           become an explicit and vital part of the strategic-management process. This chapter provided a
                                           framework for collecting and evaluating economic, social, cultural, demographic, environmen-
                                           tal, political, governmental, legal, technological, and competitive information. The AQCD Test
                                           was explained to assure that opportunities and threast as stated in an EFE Matrix are actionable,
                                           qualitative, comparative, and divisional to the extent possible.
                                                 Firms that do not mobilize and empower their managers and employees to identify, moni-
                                           tor, forecast, and evaluate key external forces may fail to anticipate emerging opportunities and
                                           threats and, consequently, may pursue ineffective strategies, miss opportunities, and invite orga-
                                           nizational demise. Firms not taking advantage of e-commerce and social-media networks are
                                           technologically falling behind.
                                                 A major responsibility of strategists is to ensure development of an effective external-audit
                                           system. This includes using information technology to devise a competitive intelligence system
                                           that works. The EFE Matrix, CPM, and Porter’s Five-Forces Model can help strategists evalu-
                                           ate their market and industry, but these tools must be accompanied by good intuitive judgment.
                                           Multinational firms especially need a systematic and effective external-audit system because
                                           external forces among foreign countries vary so greatly.

                                  Develop an EFE Matrix for Coca-Cola
               Purpose
               This exercise will give you practice in developing an EFE Matrix. An EFE Matrix summarizes the
               results of an external audit. This is an important strategic-planning tool widely used by strategists.
               Instructions
               Step 1             Join with two other students in class, and jointly prepare an EFE Matrix for Coca-Cola.
                                  Refer to the Cohesion Case (p. 56) and to Exercise 1A (p. 65), if necessary, to identify exter-
                                  nal opportunities and threats. Make sure the factors you include are actionable, quantitative,
                                  comparative, and specific. Use the online sources listed in Table 3-7. Be sure not to include
                                  strategies as opportunities; but do include as many monetary amounts, percentages, num-
                                  bers, and ratios as possible.
               Step 2             All three-person teams participating in this exercise should record their EFE total weighted
                                  scores on the board. Put your initials after your score to identify it as your team’s score.
               Step 3             Compare the total weighted scores. Which team’s score came closest to the instructor’s an-
                                  swer? Discuss reasons for variation in the scores reported on the board.

               Just like companies, states compete against each other across numerous variables. For more than a
               decade, CNBC has been conducting annual research to determine where each U.S. state ranks (out
               of the 50 states) in terms of their quality of life, job prospects, business attractiveness, and education,
               among many other things. Each year, data is collected on more than 60 measures of competitiveness
               and all 50 states are scored on each measure, ranging from economic policies and taxes, to the cost of
               food, to the quality of their workforces.
                    The purpose of this exercise is to determine how your state ranks in terms of its job outlook and
               prospects. This information can enhance your job search as you near completion of a business admin-
               istration degree.
               Instructions
               Step 1             Go to the following website https://www.cnbc.com/2017/07/11/top-states-to-find-a-job-in-
                                  america-in-2017.html and take a while to explore the types of reports offered, as well as the
                                  source of data collected and used to create such reports.
               Step 2             Review where your state ranks on the list of top states for business, top states to get an
                                  education, and top states to find a job. Determine the three best competitive aspects of your
                                  state.
               Step 3             Are there similarities between your state’s ranking on each of these three reports? Do you
                                  think job outlooks, education, and business attractiveness are inherently related? Develop a
                                  report explaining your answer. Use information from the reports to support your arguments.
                                  What actions could your state take to improve its competitiveness overall?

               Purpose
               Job hunting websites compete against each other for your business. Both job seekers and companies
               with job openings use job hunting websites, especially CareerBuider, Glassdoor, Monster Jobs, and
               ZipRecruiter. The purpose of this exercise is to familiarize you with the operation, strengths, and
               weaknesses of these four websites.

                                  What External Forces Are Most Important in Strategic
                                  Planning?
                                  Purpose
                                  A prioritized list of external factors is needed for effective strategic planning. Oftentimes the process
                                  entails all managers individually ranking the factors identified, from 1 (most important) to 20 (least
                                  important). Prioritization is absolutely essential in strategic planning because no organization can do
                                  everything that would benefit the firm; tough choices among good choices have to be made.
                                      External forces can be divided into five broad categories: (1) economic forces; (2) social, cultural,
                                  demographic, and natural environment forces; (3) political, governmental, and legal forces; (4) tech-
                                  nological forces; and (5) competitive forces. For some companies or organizations at various times,
                                  some forces may be more important to include than others. This exercise reveals the authors’ ranking
                                  of the relative importance of five external forces for inclusion in an external assessment.
                                      The purpose of this exercise is to examine more closely the external areas of a business. In ad-
                                  dition, the purpose of this exercise is to examine whether individual decision-making is better than
                                  group decision-making. Academic research suggests that groups make better decisions than individu-
                                  als about eighty percent of the time.
                                  Instructions
                                  Rank the five external forces as to their relative importance (1 = most important, 5 = least important).
                                  First, rank the forces as an individual. Then, rank the forces as part a group of three. Thus, determine
                                  what person(s) and what group(s) here today can come closest to the expert ranking. This exercise
                                  enables examination of the relative effectiveness of individual versus group decision-making in stra-
                                  tegic planning.
                                  Steps
                                   1. Fill in Column 1 in Table 3-12 to reveal your individual ranking of the relative importance of
                                      the five forces (1 = most important, 2 = next most important, etc.). For example, if you feel
                                      Economic factors are the 4th most important external force, then enter a 4 in Table 3-12 in
                                      Column 1 beside Economic.
                                   2. Fill in Column 2 in Table 3-12 to reveal your group’s ranking of the relative importance of the
                                      five forces (1 = most important, 2 = next most important, etc.).
                                   3. Fill in Column 3 in Table 3-12 to reveal the expert’s ranking of the five forces.

                4. Fill in Column 4 in Table 3-12 to reveal the absolute difference between Column 1 and Column
                   3 to reveal how well you performed as an individual in this exercise. (Note: Absolute difference
                   disregard negative numbers)
                5. Fill in Column 5 in Table 3-12 to reveal the absolute difference between Column 2 and Column
                   3 to reveal how well your group performed in this exercise.
                6. Sum Column 4. Sum Column 5.
                7. Compare the Column 4 sum with the Column 5 sum. If your Column 4 sum is less than your
                   Column 5 sum, then you performed better as an individual than as a group. Normally, group
                   decision-making is superior to individual decision-making, so if you did better than your group,
                   you did excellent.
                8. The Individual Winner(s): The individual(s) with the lowest Column 4 sum is the WINNER.

                 MINI-CASE ON SAM’S CLUB

               SAM’S CLUB IS BOOMING IN CHINA




                                                                                                                                                      Kevin Foy/Shutterstock
               Sam’s Club in the United States has struggled to attract affluent shoppers. However, in China, Sam’s
               Club targets high-income consumers, and specifically affluent mothers with young children. Sam’s
               Club does a great job at positioning itself for the wealthy Chinese target market. Advertised as a
               trusted place with imported goods and high-quality foods, Sam’s Club stores are located in China’s
               most affluent cities. Its success thus far in China can be attributed largely to its effective market seg-
               mentation, targeting, and positioning.
                    Many large firms have trouble doing business in China despite the country’s high GDP, rising
               levels of disposable income, shift to becoming a high-tech nation, and growing middle class. But
               Walmart’s Sam’s Clubs are booming in China. Three of the top five Sam’s Clubs by sales are located
               in China. Rather than positioning itself as a place for bulk items and closeouts, Sam’s Clubs in China
               are positioned as a place for high-quality products and foods. For example, eggs are guaranteed to be
               less than 12 days old and all have a serial number that customers can enter into their smartphone and
               see the production date and origin.
                    Sam’s in China benefits from not having to “do battle” with Costco Wholesale; Costco does no
               business in China. Sam’s has roughly 2 million members in China, many whom are affluent moms age
               35 to 40, a primary target group. The number of Sam’s stores in China is expected to increase from 20
               at the start of 2018 to 40 by 2020. Sam’s in China recently provided “two-kid seat” carts in all stores
               to take advantage of China recently relaxing its “one-child policy.”
                    Another feature of Sam’s stores in China is extra large parking lots; nearly all customers drive to
               Sam’s and ample parking is greatly appreciated in a country where crowded and expensive parking is the
               norm otherwise. Sam’s strategies in China are an excellent example of how a firm must adapt it policies,

                                               T
                                                       his chapter focuses on identifying and evaluating a firm’s strengths and weaknesses in
                                                       the functional areas of business, including management, marketing, finance, accounting,
                                                       and management information systems (MIS). Careful evaluation of a business’ functional
                                                areas is necessary to determine the firm’s core competencies and understand whether the firm’s
                                                current strategy is effectively working to provide a sustainable competitive advantage. One ex-
                                                cellent way to evaluate the effectiveness of a firm’s strategy is to study the firm’s financial per-
                                                formance relative to competitors and industry averages. Financial information alone, however,
                                                cannot provide a complete assessment of the effectiveness of a firm’s strategy, and strategists as
                                                well as students of strategy must dig deep into management, marketing, finance, accounting, and
                                                MIS issues simultaneously to fully understand why a firm’s strategy is effective or not.
                                                     The first two-thirds of this chapter address potential strengths and weaknesses in the func-
                                                tional areas cited in terms of what, where, how, and why to obtain this information; the latter

                   Some researchers emphasize the importance of the internal-audit part of the strategic-
               management process by comparing it to the external audit in importance. Robert Grant, for
               example, concluded that the internal audit is more important, saying:

                   In a world where customer preferences are volatile, the identity of customers is chang-
                   ing, and the technologies for serving customer requirements are continually evolving, an
                   externally focused orientation does not provide a secure foundation for formulating long-
                   term strategy. When the external environment is in a state of flux, the firm’s own resources
                   and capabilities may be a much more stable basis on which to define its identity. Hence,
                   a definition of a business in terms of what it is capable of doing may offer a more durable
                   basis for strategy.1

               Resource-Based View
               The resource-based view (RBV) approach to competitive advantage contends that internal
               resources are more important for a firm than external factors in achieving and sustaining compet-
               itive advantage. Proponents of RBV theory contend that a firm’s performance is primarily deter-
               mined by internal resources that enable the firm to exploit opportunities and neutralize threats. A
               firm’s resources can be tangible, such as labor, capital, land, plant, and equipment, or intangible,
               such as culture, knowledge, brand equity, reputation, and intellectual property. Because tangible
               resources can more easily be bought and sold, intangible resources are often more important for
               gaining and sustaining competitive advantages.
                    A resource can be considered valuable to the extent that it is (1) rare, (2) hard to imitate,
               or (3) not easily substitutable. Often called empirical indicators, these three characteristics of
               resources enable a firm to implement strategies that improve its efficiency and effectiveness and
               lead to a sustainable competitive advantage. The more a resource(s) is rare (not held by many
               firms in the industry), hard to imitate (hard to copy or achieve), and not easily substitutable
               (invulnerable to threat of substitution from different products), the stronger a firm’s competitive
               advantage will be and the longer the advantage will last. Valuable resources comprise strengths
               that a firm can capitalize on to prosper in a given industry.
                    The basic premise of RBV theory is that the mix, type, amount, and nature of a firm’s
               internal resources should be considered first and foremost in devising strategies that can lead to
               sustainable competitive advantage. Managing strategically according to the RBV involves devel-
               oping and exploiting a firm’s unique resources and capabilities, and continually maintaining and
               strengthening those resources.
                    As indicated in the Ethics Capsule 4, exploiting a firm’s unique resources and capabilities
               can present ethical dilemmas.

               Key Internal Forces
               An internal strategic-management assessment includes analysis of how strong or weak a firm
               is in each functional area of business, including management, marketing, finance, accounting,
               and MIS. Uniqueness or distinctive competences a firm has or lacks in each area provides
               the foundation for identifying strength and weakness factors. Strengths that cannot be easily
               matched or imitated by competitors are called distinctive competencies. It is of paramount
               importance in strategic planning to capitalize on and nurture strengths because competitive
               advantages generally arise more from strengths, uniqueness, and distinctive competencies than
               from weaknesses. Improving on weaknesses, however, is a vital task for all organizations and
               generally helps to improve efficiencies, weaknesses are unlikely to develop into sustainable
               competitive advantages, thus stressing the importance of nurturing strengths.
                    It is impossible in a strategic-management text to review in depth all the material pre-
               sented in prior business courses; there are many subareas within these functions, such as
               customer service, warranties, advertising, packaging, and pricing under marketing. However,
               strategic planning must include a detailed assessment of how the firm is doing in all internal
               areas. Thus, an overview of each of the functional business areas from a strategy perspective
               is provided here. Regardless of the type or size of firm, effective strategic planning hinges
               on identification and prioritization of internal strengths and weaknesses because a firm must

               Planning
               Planning is the essential bridge between the present and the future; planning increases the likeli-
               hood of achieving desired results. Even though planning is considered the foundation of manage-
               ment, it is the task that managers most commonly neglect. Planning enables a firm to:
                   1. Take into account relevant factors and focus on the critical ones
                   2. Ensure that the firm is prepared for all reasonable eventualities and can make timely
                      changes and adapt as needed
                   3. Gather the resources needed and carry out tasks in the most efficient way possible
                   4. Conserve its own resources and avoid wasting natural resources
                   5. Assess whether the effort, costs, and implications associated with achieving desired objec-
                      tives are warranted
                   6. Be proactive, anticipate, and influence the future
                    Planning is more than simply projecting past and present trends into the future (long-range plan-
               ning). Planning also includes revising a firm’s vision and mission, forecasting future events and trends,
               establishing objectives, and choosing strategies to pursue. Successful organizations strive to guide their
               own futures rather than merely react to external forces and events as they occur. Historically, organisms
               and organizations that adapt well to changing conditions survive and prosper; others become extinct.
                    An organization can develop synergy through planning. Synergy exists when everyone pulls
               together as a team that knows what it wants to achieve; synergy is the 2 + 2 = 5 effect. By
               establishing and communicating clear objectives, employees and managers can work together
               toward desired results. Synergy can result in powerful competitive advantages. The strategic-­
               management process itself is aimed at creating synergy in an organization.
                    Strengths and weaknesses with respect to planning could relate to: (1) quality of a firm’s vision
               or mission and how well the firm’s strategies support the vision or mission, (2) divisions’ relative
               contribution to the firm’s performance, and (3) resource allocation across regions and products.

               Organizing
               The purpose of organizing is to achieve coordinated effort by defining task and authority relation-
               ships. Organizing means determining who does what and who reports to whom. There are count-
               less examples in history of well-organized enterprises successfully competing against—and in
               some cases defeating—much stronger but less-organized firms. A well-organized firm generally
               has motivated managers and employees who are committed to seeing the organization succeed.
               Resources are allocated more effectively and used more efficiently in a well-organized firm.
                    The organizing function of management can be viewed as consisting of three sequential
               activities: breaking down tasks into jobs, combining jobs to form departments, and delegating
               authority. In The Wealth of Nations, published in 1776, Adam Smith cited the advantages of work
               specialization in the manufacture of pins:

                    One man draws the wire, another straightens it, a third cuts it, a fourth points it, a fifth
                    grinds it at the top for receiving the head. Ten men working in this manner can produce
                    48,000 pins in a single day, but if they had all wrought separately and independently, each
                    might at best produce twenty pins in a day.2

               Organizing includes developing an appropriate structure, span of control, and chain of command.
               Structure dictates how resources are allocated and how objectives are established in a firm. Changes
               in strategy often require changes in structure because positions may be created, deleted, or merged.
               The most common types of structure are discussed in Chapter 7. Strengths and weaknesses with
               respect to organizing could relate to (1) how well the firm’s current structure matches the various
               divisions and strategy of the firm, (2) the degree to which a clear chain of command is displayed
               through executive titles, and (3) the extent of overlap among related jobs and job descriptions.

               Motivating
               Motivating is the process of influencing people to accomplish specific objectives. Motivation
               helps explain why some people work hard and others do not. Strategies have little chance of
               succeeding if employees are not motivated to implement them once they are formulated. The

                                  motivating function of management includes such activities as developing leaders, managing
                                  groups, communicating effectively, and managing organizational change.
                                       When managers and employees of a firm strive to achieve high levels of productivity,
                                  this indicates that the firm’s strategists are excellent leaders—persons that establish rap-
                                  port with subordinates, empathize with their needs and concerns, set a good example, and
                                  are trustworthy and fair. An excellent leader communicates a vision of the firm’s future
                                  and inspires people to work hard to achieve that vision. Stressing the importance of leader-
                                  ship, Sun Tzu stated, “Weak leadership can wreck the soundest strategy.” According to Peter
                                  Drucker:

                                     Leadership is not a magnetic personality. That can just as well be demagoguery. It is not
                                     “making friends and influencing people.” That is flattery. Leadership is the lifting of a
                                     person’s vision to higher sights, the raising of a person’s performance to a higher standard,
                                     the building of a person’s personality beyond its normal limitations.3

                                       An organization’s system of communication determines whether strategies can be imple-
                                  mented successfully. Good two-way communication is vital for gaining support for departmen-
                                  tal and divisional objectives and policies. Top-down communication can encourage bottom-up
                                  communication. The strategic-management process becomes a lot easier when subordinates are
                                  encouraged to discuss their concerns, reveal their problems, provide recommendations, and give
                                  suggestions. A primary reason for instituting strategic management is to build and support effec-
                                  tive communication networks throughout the firm.
                                       Human resource management (HRM) includes activities such as recruiting, interviewing,
                                  testing, selecting, orienting, training, developing, caring for, evaluating, rewarding, disciplining,
                                  promoting, transferring, demoting, and dismissing employees, as well as managing union rela-
                                  tions. The complexity and importance of HRM has increased to such a degree that all but the
                                  smallest organizations generally have a full-time human resource manager. As employees and
                                  managers come and go, HRM must manage this process effectively to maintain employee morale
                                  and minimize workplace stress. Table 4-2 reveals several of many ways that effective HRM can
                                  help create and maintain a competitive advantage for organizations. The type of HRM informa-
                                  tion listed in Table 4-2 could be the source of a firm’s strengths or weaknesses with respect to the
                                  overall motivation of managers and employees.


                                  Controlling
                                  All managers in an organization have controlling responsibilities, such as conducting performance
                                  evaluations and taking necessary action to minimize inefficiencies. The controlling function of
                                  management is particularly important for effective strategy evaluation (the focal topic of Chapter
                                  9). Controlling consists of four basic steps:
                                   1.   Establishing performance standards
                                   2.   Measuring individual and organizational performance
                                   3.   Comparing actual performance to planned performance standards
                                   4.   Taking corrective actions

                    The production/operations portion of a business consists of all those activities that trans-
               form inputs (raw materials, labor, capital, machines, and facilities) into finished goods and ser-
               vices. The extent to which a manufacturing plant’s output reaches its full potential output is
               called capacity utilization, a key strategic variable. The higher the capacity utilization, the bet-
               ter; otherwise, equipment may sit idle. For example, if a manufacturing firm’s plants are averag-
               ing 60 percent capacity utilization, that would represent a severe weakness of the firm.
                    As indicated in Table 4-3, Roger Schroeder suggests that production/operations comprises
               five decision areas: process, capacity, inventory, workforce, and quality. Production/operations
               activities often represent the largest part of an organization’s human and capital assets. In many
               industries, the major costs of producing a product are incurred within operations, so production/
               operations can have great value as a competitive weapon in a company’s overall strategy. Strengths
               and weaknesses in the five areas of production can mean the success or failure of an enterprise.
                    Increasingly in production settings, a new breed of robots called collaborative machines
               are working alongside people. Priced as low as $20,000 and becoming widely used even in
               small businesses, robots do not take lunch breaks or sick days or require health insurance, and
               they can work nonstop all night tirelessly if needed. Collaborative machines are more flexi-
               ble, often doing one task one day and a different task the next day. At Panek Precision Inc., a
               Northbrook, Illinois-based machine shop, Mr. Panek states, “Having robots has allowed us to
               move our existing workers into more useful tasks, such as monitoring more-advanced machines
               that require human tending.” Workers are generally quite receptive to collaborative machines,
               even giving them names, such as “Fred” at Stuller Inc., a jewelry factory in Lafayette, Louisiana,
               and “Baxter” at K’NEX Brands, a toy maker in Hatfield, Pennsylvania.4 Strengths and weak-
               nesses with respect to controlling could relate to (1) inventory turnover levels versus competitors,
               (2) how well or poorly the firm’s operations are performing across various geographical regions,
               and (3) how cost efficient the firm is in acquiring needed supplies.

               Integrating Strategy and Culture
               The functions of management can be performed best when a firm’s strategy and culture are inte-
               grated. Every business entity has a unique organizational culture that impacts strategic-planning
               activities. Organizational culture is “a pattern of behavior that has been developed by an orga-
               nization as it learns to cope with its problem of external adaptation and internal integration, and
               that has worked well enough to be considered valid and to be taught to new members as the cor-
               rect way to perceive, think, and feel.”5 This definition emphasizes the importance of matching
               external with internal factors in making strategic decisions. Organizational culture captures the
               subtle, elusive, and largely unconscious forces that shape a workplace. Remarkably resistant to
               change, culture can represent a major strength or weakness for any firm.
                    The strategic-management process takes place largely within a particular organization’s cul-
               ture. A culture ideally supports the collective commitment of its people to a common purpose.
               It must foster competence and enthusiasm among managers and employees. If strategies can
               capitalize on cultural strengths, such as a strong work ethic or highly ethical beliefs, then man-
               agement often can swiftly and easily implement changes. However, if the firm’s culture is not

                                  supportive, strategic changes may be ineffective or even counterproductive. A firm’s culture can
                                  become antagonistic to new strategies, with the result being confusion and disorientation.
                                       To achieve and maintain competitive advantage, firms must continually learn, adapt, and
                                  evolve. Adapting to change can be difficult, particularly when change includes forging new
                                  alliances, partnerships, or mergers between different companies, each of which likely has its
                                  own unique culture and unique identity. Table 4-4 provides some example (possible) aspects of
                                  an organization’s culture and possible considerations for identifying strengths and weaknesses
                                  within the firm.
                                       When one firm acquires another firm, integrating the two cultures effectively can be vital
                                  for success. For example, in Table 4-4, one firm may score mostly 1s (low) and the other firm
                                  may score mostly 5s (high), which would present a challenging strategic problem. Regardless
                                  of a firm’s industry, geography, or company history, it is imperative that firms effectively inte-
                                  grate corporate strategy and culture, even as they continuously adapt and evolve overtime.
                                       An organization’s culture should infuse individuals with enthusiasm for implementing
                                  strategies. Internal strengths and weaknesses associated with a firm’s culture sometimes are
                                  overlooked because of the interfunctional nature of this phenomenon. This is a key reason why
                                  strategists need to view and understand their firm as a sociocultural system. Success is often
                                  determined by links between a firm’s culture and strategies. The challenge of strategic manage-
                                  ment today is to bring about the changes in organizational culture and individual mind-sets that
                                  are needed to support the formulation, implementation, and evaluation of strategies.

                                  Management Audit Checklist of Questions
                                  The following checklist of questions can help determine specific strengths and weaknesses in
                                  the management functional area of business. An answer of no to any question could indicate a
                                  potential weakness, although the strategic significance and implications of negative answers, of
                                  course, will vary by organization, industry, and severity of the weakness. Positive or yes answers
                                  to the checklist questions suggest potential areas of strength.
                                    1.   Does the firm use strategic-management concepts?
                                    2.   Are company objectives and goals measurable and well communicated?
                                    3.   Do managers at all hierarchical levels plan effectively?
                                    4.   Do managers delegate authority well?
                                    5.   Is the organization’s structure appropriate?
                                    6.   Are job descriptions and job specifications clear?
                                    7.   Is employee morale high?

               Marketing                                                                                              LO 4.3
               Marketing can be described as the process of defining, anticipating, and fulfilling consum-
               ers’ needs and wants. Marketing is about satisfying current and potential customers’ needs.
               Excellent marketing can provide firms with a competitive advantage. Table 4-5 lists compa-
               nies that lead their respective industries in customer satisfaction according to the American
               Customer Satisfaction Index (ACSI) that surveys around 180,000 U.S. customers each year.
                     Marketing consists of five basic activities: (1) marketing research and target market analy-
               sis, (2) product planning, (3) pricing products, (4) promoting products, and (5) placing or distrib-
               uting products. Understanding these activities helps strategists identify and evaluate marketing
               strengths and weaknesses—a vital strategy-formulation activity.

               Marketing Research and Target Market Analysis
               Marketing research is the systematic gathering, recording, and analyzing of data to identify and
               define opportunities and problems related to the marketing of goods and services. Marketing
               research is often used to help firms evaluate and formulate strategies. Marketing researchers
               employ numerous scales, instruments, procedures, concepts, and techniques to gather infor-
               mation; their research can uncover critical strengths and weaknesses. Organizations that pos-
               sess excellent marketing research skills have a competitive advantage. According to the former
               president of PepsiCo:

                    Looking at the competition is the company’s best form of market research. The majority
                    of our strategic successes are ideas that we borrow from the marketplace, usually from a
                    small regional or local competitor. In each case, we spot a promising new idea, improve on
                    it, and then out-execute our competitor.6

                    An important use of marketing research involves target market analysis—the examina-
               tion and evaluation of consumer needs and wants. Marketing research involves methods such as
               administering customer surveys, analyzing consumer information, evaluating market positioning
               strategies, developing customer profiles, and determining optimal market segmentation strate-
               gies, all of which contribute to effective customer analysis.

    132    PART 2 • STRATEGY FORMULATION

                                       Successful organizations continually monitor present and potential customers’ buying pat-
                                  terns and engage in extensive marketing research to understand the needs and wants of differ-
                                  ent segments of customers. Firms tailor their product offerings to fit the needs of their target
                                  market(s). Many companies have recently shifted their target markets to focus on younger con-
                                  sumers, and particularly millennials because these individuals now make up the largest group
                                  of U.S. consumers. For example, Home Depot, P&G, Williams-Sonoma Inc., Sherwin-Williams
                                  Co., and Scotts Miracle-Gro Company are now targeting millennials by offering online lessons
                                  aimed at teaching basic skills such as how to mow a lawn, use a tape measure, hammer a nail,
                                  and care for plants.
                                       With a clearly defined target market, marketers can best use their strategic toolbox to ensure
                                  that their firm’s offering delivers value to target customers. A clear understanding of a firm’s
                                  target market(s) serves as the foundation on which the marketing mix is designed. Commonly
                                  referred to as the “four Ps of marketing,” the marketing mix includes product, price, promotion,
                                  and place, as indicated in Table 4-6. Marketers design a marketing mix to fit the unique needs of
                                  each target market. Table 4-6 reveals key areas to consider when searching for and identifying
                                  possible strengths and weaknesses related to the marketing functional area of a firm.


                                  Product Planning
                                  Products can be physical goods, services, ideas, or anything a company offers to satisfy individual
                                  or business customer needs through the exchange process. Product planning includes devising
                                  warranties; packaging; determining product options, features, brand style, and quality; deleting
                                  old products; and providing customer service. Product planning is particularly important when
                                  a company is pursuing product development or diversification. In such cases, companies often
                                  must decide whether to extend an existing product line or create an entirely new product line. In
                                  implementing a product development strategy, the Campbell Soup Company, for example, may
                                  consider extending its line of soups by developing a new soup, or entering a new category of
                                  products by perhaps offering a marinade.
                                       One important part of product planning involves test marketing, which allows an organiza-
                                  tion to examine alternative marketing plans, learn about potential problems with the product,
                                  uncover ways to better market the product, or forecast future sales of new products. In conduct-
                                  ing a test-market project, an organization must decide how many cities to include, which cities
                                  to include, how long to run the test, what information to collect during the test, and what action
                                  to take after the test has been completed. Test marketing is used more frequently by consumer
                                  goods companies than industrial goods companies. The technique can enable an organization to
                                  avoid substantial losses by revealing weak products and ineffective marketing approaches before
                                  large-scale production begins.
                                       Another important part of product planning is research and development (R&D). Many
                                  firms today conduct no R&D, and yet many other companies depend on successful R&D activ-
                                  ities for survival. Firms pursuing a product-development strategy especially need to have a
                                  strong R&D orientation. High-tech firms, such as Microsoft, spend a much larger proportion
                                  of their revenues on R&D. A key decision for many firms is whether to be a “first mover” or a
                                  “fast follower” (i.e., spend heavily on R&D to be the first to develop radically new products,
                                  or spend less on R&D by imitating, duplicating, or improving on products after rival firms
                                  develop them).

                    Most firms have no choice but to continually develop new and improved products because
               of changing consumer needs and tastes, new technologies, shortened product life cycles, and
               increased domestic and foreign competition. A shortage of ideas for new products, increased
               global competition, increased market segmentation, strong special-interest groups, and
               increased government regulations are several factors making the successful development of
               new products more and more difficult, costly, and risky. In the pharmaceutical industry, for
               example, only one of every few thousand drugs created in the laboratory ends up on pharma-
               cists’ shelves.
                    Strengths and weaknesses with respect to products could relate to (1) the value of a firm’s
               brands relative to competitors’ brands, (2) the firm’s product assortment or cannibalism among
               the firm’s existing products, or (3) features of the firm’s products relative to those of similar
               products found in the marketplace.

               Pricing
               Pricing refers to deciding the amount an individual must exchange to receive a firm’s product
               offering. Pricing objectives often include setting prices at levels which maximize profit, sales,
               or market share or setting prices to weaken the competition’s marketing efforts, to enhance cus-
               tomer satisfaction, or to enhance the image and prestige of a product. Pricing strategies are often
               based on costs, demand, the competition, or on customers’ needs. Sometimes “free is a good
               price,” as evidenced by what Google and Facebook charge basic customers.
                    Widespread Internet use and advances in technology have enabled firms to quickly adjust
               prices to meet changes in the marketplace. In dynamic pricing strategies, the same product
               may be sold to different customers for different prices, or even to the same customer for dif-
               ferent prices. Intense price competition, coupled with Internet price-comparative shopping,
               has reduced profit margins to bare minimum levels for many companies. Target and Best Buy
               are among the many companies that now offer to match online prices of rival retailers. Both
               companies are seeking to combat “showrooming” by shoppers who check out products in their
               stores but buy them on rivals’ websites. Issues related to pricing can represent key strengths or
               weaknesses for firms.
                    Firms must be aware of government constraints on pricing, including regulations regard-
               ing price fixing, price discrimination, predatory pricing, unit pricing, price advertising, and
               price controls. For example, the Robinson-Patman Act prohibits manufacturers and wholesal-
               ers from discriminating in price among channel member purchasers (retailers and wholesal-
               ers) if competition is lessened. Pricing products in digital currencies, as discussed in Global
               Capsule 4, is increasingly a necessary consideration. Strengths and weaknesses with respect to
               pricing could relate to whether the focal firm price matches or not and why, or how the firm’s
               prices (including currencies in which the products can be paid) compare to similar products
               sold by competitors.

               Promotion
               Successful strategy implementation generally rests on the ability of an organization to sell some
               good or service. Promotion includes many marketing activities, such as advertising, sales pro-
               motion, public relations, personal selling, and direct marketing. Common promotional tools
               designed to inform consumers about products include TV advertising, magazine ads, billboards,
               websites, and public relations, among others. Discounts, coupons, and samples are often used to
               encourage purchase. Promotional tools such as personal selling, buzz building, and social media
               are often used to build relationships with customers. The effectiveness of various promotional
               tools for consumer and industrial products varies. Personal selling is especially important for
               industrial goods companies, whereas advertising and social-media marketing are more impor-
               tant for consumer goods companies. Determining organizational strengths and weaknesses in
               the promotional function of marketing is an important part of performing an internal strategic-
               management audit.
                    Promotion in general and advertising in particular can be expensive, a primary reason
               marketing is a major business function to be studied carefully. Without marketing, even the
               best products have little chance of being successful. Worldwide advertising expenditures are
               increasing around 5 percent annually and are expected to reach $700 billion in 2021. Digital

                                             to build relationships and establish emotional bonds with consumers. As social networks, virtual

                                             Channels of Distribution
                                             Channels of distribution is a term that refers to the various intermediaries that take a product
                                             from a producer to an end customer. These intermediaries bear a variety of names such as whole-
                                             salers, retailers, brokers, facilitators, agents, vendors—or simply distributors. In this regard mar-
                                             keters often make decisions related to warehousing, distribution channels, distribution coverage,
                                             retail site locations, sales territories, inventory location, transportation carriers, wholesaling, and
                                             retailing.
                                                  Marketers must determine how widely available their product should be for consumers to
                                             find and purchase. Some firms offer their products through as many wholesalers and retailers
                                             that will sell them while other firms offer products only through several select outlets or autho-
                                             rized outlets.
                                                  Some of the most complex and challenging decisions facing a firm concern product distri-
                                             bution. Successful organizations identify and evaluate alternative ways to reach their ultimate
                                             market. Many companies today are increasingly making their products available for purchase
                                             online, directly through their website, but this practice can upset retailers. Efficient supply chain
                                             and distribution systems are essential for any firm to gain and sustain a competitive advantage.
                                                  Strengths and weaknesses with respect to promotion could relate to the effectiveness of
                                             brick-and-mortar versus online sales or the average return on investment (ROI) of various pur-

               Marketing Audit Checklist of Questions
               The following types of questions about marketing must be examined in performing an internal
               assessment
                   1.   Are markets segmented effectively?
                   2.   Is the organization positioned well among competitors?
                   3.   Are present channels of distribution reliable and cost effective?
                   4.   Is the firm conducting and using market research effectively?
                   5.   Are product quality and customer service good?
                   6.   Are the firm’s products and services priced appropriately?
                   7.   Does the firm have an effective promotional strategy?
                   8.   Is the firm’s Internet presence excellent as compared to rivals?


               Finance and Accounting                                                                                 LO 4.4
               Financial condition is often considered the single-best measure of a firm’s competitive
               position and overall attractiveness to investors. Table 4-7 lists top companies for financial
               strength according to the Drucker Institute, which assesses financial performance based on
               return on assets, return on equity, return on invested capital, market share and profits, as well
               as investors’ return on their shares. Note that Accenture PLC heads the list. Determining
               an organization’s financial strengths and weaknesses is essential in formulating strategies.
               A firm’s liquidity, leverage, working capital, profitability, asset utilization, cash flow, and
               equity can eliminate some strategies as being feasible alternatives. Financial factors often
               impact existing strategies and influence strategy-implementation plans.

               Finance and Accounting
                According to James Van Horne, finance and accounting activities can be categorized into
                three decision areas: the investment decision, the financing decision, and the dividend
               ­decision.8 The investment decision, also called capital budgeting, is the allocation and real-
                location of capital and resources to projects, products, assets, and divisions of an organization.
                After strategies are formulated, capital budgeting decisions are required to successfully imple-
                ment strategies. The financing decision determines the best capital structure for the firm and
                includes examining various methods by which the firm can raise capital (for example, by issuing
                stock, increasing debt, selling assets, or using a combination of these approaches). The financing
                decision must consider both short-term and long-term needs for working capital. Two key finan-
                cial ratios that indicate whether a firm’s financing decisions have been effective are the debt-to-
                equity ratio and the debt-to-total-assets ratio.

                                       Dividend decisions concern issues such as the dollar amount per share to pay quarterly to stock-
                                  holders, the stability of dividends paid over time, and the repurchase or issuance of stock. Dividend
                                  decisions determine the amount of funds that are retained in a firm compared to the amount paid out
                                  to stockholders. Three financial ratios that are helpful in evaluating a firm’s dividend decisions are
                                  the earnings-per-share ratio, the dividends-per-share ratio, and the price-earnings ratio. The benefits
                                  of paying dividends to investors must be balanced against the benefits of internally retaining funds,
                                  and there is no set formula on how to balance this trade-off. Sometimes to appease shareholders,
                                  dividends are paid out (1) even when the firm has incurred a negative annual net income, (2) even
                                  when the firm has to obtain outside sources of capital to pay for the dividends, and (3) even when the
                                  funds were needed as reinvestment in the business. Reasons for this practice are as follows:
                                   1. Paying cash dividends is customary for some firms. Failure to do so could be thought of as
                                      a stigma. A dividend change is a signal about the future.
                                   2. Dividends represent a sales point for investment bankers. Some institutional investors can
                                      buy only dividend-paying stocks.
                                   3. Shareholders often demand dividends, even in companies with great opportunities for rein-
                                      vesting all available funds.
                                   4. A myth exists that paying dividends will result in a higher stock price.

                                  Financial Ratios
                                  Financial ratio analysis is the most widely used method for determining an organization’s streng­
                                  ths and weaknesses in the investment, financing, and dividend areas. Because the functional areas of
                                  business are so closely related, financial ratios can actually signal strengths or weaknesses anywhere
                                  up and down a firm’s value chain from suppliers through production to distribution.
                                        Financial ratios are computed from an organization’s income statement and balance sheet.
                                  Computing financial ratios is like taking a photograph: The results reflect a situation at just one point
                                  in time. Comparing ratios over time and to industry averages is more likely to result in meaningful
                                  statistics that can be used to identify and evaluate strengths and weaknesses. Financial ratio trend
                                  analysis, illustrated in Figure 4-2, is a useful technique that incorporates both the time and industry
                                  average dimensions of financial ratios. Note that the dotted lines reveal projected ratios.
                                        Financial ratios are equally applicable in for-profit and nonprofit organizations, but the ratios
                                  vary considerably across types of industries. Even though nonprofit organizations would not have
                                  return-on-investment or earnings-per-share ratios, they would routinely monitor many other spe-
                                  cial ratios. For example, a religious organization would monitor the ratio of dollar contributions
                                  to the number of members, whereas a zoo would monitor dollar food sales to number of visitors.
                                  A university would monitor number of students divided by number of professors. Nonprofit
                                  organizations because strive to be financially sound just as for-profit firms do. Nonprofit organi-
                                  zations need strategic planning just as much as for-profit firms.
                                        Financial ratio analysis should be conducted on three separate fronts:
                                   1. How has each ratio changed over time? This information provides a means of evaluating
                                      historical trends. Examine whether each ratio has been historically increasing, decreasing,
                                      or nearly constant. Analysts often calculate the percentage change in a ratio from one year
                                      to the next to assess historical financial performance on that dimension. Large percentage
                                      changes can be especially relevant, but be mindful that if base numbers are small then large
                                      percentage changes can ensue more easily.
                                   2. How does each ratio compare to industry norms? A firm’s inventory turnover ratio may
                                      appear impressive at first glance but may pale when compared to industry standards or
                                      norms. Industries can differ dramatically on certain ratios. For example, grocery companies
                                      have a high inventory turnover, whereas automobile dealerships have a lower turnover.
                                      Therefore, comparison of a firm’s ratios within its particular industry can be essential in
                                      determining strengths and weaknesses.
                                   3. How does each ratio compare with key competitors? Often competition is more intense
                                      between several competitors in a given industry or location than across all rival firms in
                                      the industry. When this is true, financial ratio analysis should include comparison to those
                                      key competitors. For example, if a firm’s profitability ratio is trending up over time and
                                      compares favorably to the industry average, but it is trending down relative to its leading
                                      competitor, there may be reason for concern.

               Excellent free online and subscription (fee-based) resources for obtaining financial information
               about firms and industries are provided in Table 4-8. Some sources listed provide financial ratios.
               The free Excel template at www.strategyclub.com calculates ratios once students enter in rel-
               evant data.
                    Financial ratio analysis is not without some limitations. For example, financial ratios are
               based on accounting data, and firms differ in their treatment of such items as depreciation, inven-
               tory valuation, R&D expenditures, pension plan costs, mergers, and taxes. Also, seasonal factors
               can influence comparative ratios. Therefore, conformity to industry composite ratios does not
               establish with certainty that a firm is performing normally or that it is well managed. Likewise,
               departures from industry averages do not always indicate that a firm is doing especially well or
               badly. For example, a high inventory turnover ratio could indicate efficient inventory manage-
               ment and a strong working capital position, but it also could indicate a serious inventory shortage
               and a weak working capital position.
                    Another limitation of financial ratios in terms of including them as key internal factors in
               the upcoming IFE Matrix is that financial ratios are not very “actionable” in terms of reveal-
               ing potential strategies needed (i.e., because they generally are based on performance of the
               overall firm). For example, to include as a key internal factor that the firm’s “current ratio
               increased from 1.8 to 2.1” is not as actionable because the factor does not specify which cur-
               rent assets or current liabilities were most significant in contributing to the change. In contrast,
               a factor such as “the firm’s fragrance division revenues increased 18 percent in Africa in 2018”
               would be considerably more actionable because more insight is provided as to actions needed
               to address the issue. Recall from the prior chapter the importance of factors being stated in
               actionable terms. The AQCD (actionable-quantitative-comparative-divisional) Test discussed
               in the prior chapter for performing an external assessment is equally important in performing
               an internal assessment.
                    Table 4-9 provides a summary of key financial ratios showing how each ratio is calculated
               and what each ratio measures. However, all the ratios are not significant for all industries and
               companies. For example, accounts receivable turnover and average collection period are not

                                           Financial analysis provides an excellent tool for identifying many strengths and weaknesses of
                                           the firm but the numbers themselves generally do not reveal the source of issues, which could
                                           stem for example from marketing and promotional effectiveness, HRM and employee produc-
                                           tivity, accounting errors, and so on. Therefore, carefully study your firm’s Form 10K or Annual
                                           Report and other company documents including quarterly reports to uncover strengths and weak-
                                           nesses associated within the functional areas. Finance and accounting strengths and weaknesses
                                           could relate to issues such as the firm’s use of debt versus equity to raise capital, the firms divi-
                                           dend policy, or the firm’s acquisition versus organic growth practices.


                                  LO 4.5   Management Information Systems
                                           Information ties all business functions together and provides the basis for all managerial
                                           decisions. Information can represent a major source of competitive advantage or disadvan-
                                           tage and a major source of a firm’s internal strength and weakness factors. A management
                                           information system (MIS) collects, codes, stores, synthesizes, and presents information in
                                           such a manner that it aids in operational and strategic decision making. The heart of an infor-
                                           mation system is a database containing the kinds of records and data important to managers.
                                           If a business fails to manage information well, this is an internal weakness that needs fixing.

                                           Business Analytics
                                           Business analytics is a business technique that involves using software to mine huge volumes
                                           of data to help executives make decisions. Sometimes called predictive analytics, machine
                                           learning, or data mining, this software enables a researcher to assess and use the aggregate
                                           experience of an organization, which is a priceless strategic asset for a firm. The history of a
                                           firm’s interaction with its customers, suppliers, distributors, employees, rival firms, and more
                                           can all be tapped with data mining to generate predictive models. Business analytics is similar
                                           to the actuarial methods used by insurance companies to rate customers by the chance of posi-
                                           tive or negative outcomes. Every business is basically a risk management endeavor! Therefore,
                                           like insurance companies, all businesses can benefit from measuring, tracking, and computing
                                           the risk associated with hundreds of strategic and tactical decisions made every day.
                                                Strategists use business analytics to provide a firm with proprietary business intelligence
                                           regarding, for example, which segment(s) of customers choose your firm versus those who defer,
                                           delay, or defect to a competitor and why. In addition to understanding consumer behavior better,
                                           which yields more effective and efficient marketing, business analytics also is being used to slash
                                           expenses by, for example, withholding retention offers from customers who are going to stay
                                           with the firm anyway, or managing fraudulent transactions involving invoices, credit-card pur-
                                           chases, tax returns, insurance claims, mobile phone calls, online ad clicks, and more. Business
                                           analytics can also reveal where competitors are weak so that marketing activities can be directly
                                           targeted to take advantage of resultant opportunities.
                                                Business analytics enables a firm to learn from experience and to make current and future
                                           decisions based on prior information. Deriving robust predictive models from data mining to
                                           support hundreds of commonly occurring business decisions is the essence of learning from
                                           experience. The mathematical models and analysis of thousands, millions, or even billions of
                                           prior data points can reveal patterns of behavior for optimizing the deployment of resources and
                                           can dramatically enhance decision making at all organizational levels and all stages of strategic
                                           management. Business analytics can identify and analyze patterns, but perhaps more impor-
                                           tantly, they can reveal the likelihood of an event, and that information can be worth millions of
                                           dollars to companies, organizations, and governments.
                                                In 2018, global data analytics software is expected to reach $21.7 billion, a 64 percent
                                           increase from 2012.9 Leading firms providing the software include IBM, SAP, Oracle, Microsoft,
                                           Qlik Technologies, Tibco Software, and Tableau Software. CEOs are increasingly worried about
                                           cybersecurity issues. The number of U.S. data breaches reached a record of 791 in the first
                                           6 months of 2017, up 29 percent from the same period the prior year.10 Fearing potential data
                                           breaches, CEOs are emphasizing to individuals throughout the company the importance of data
                                           security and are prioritizing cybersecurity efforts.
                                                In terms of cyberthreats, a recent Wall Street Journal article revealed what companies should
                                           be most concerned about and what they can do to mitigate the threat.11 The biggest threat currently

               place in organizations to prevent employees from having broad access to company information and
               data because hackers from various countries and companies and lone wolves are increasingly gain-
               ing access to corporate files through employees and managers who unknowingly allow the access to
               seemingly honest “constituencies.” Cyberthreats are more a people threat than a technology threat.



               The Internal Factor Evaluation (IFE) Matrix                                                              LO 4.6
               The internal topics discussed so far in this chapter provide a foundation for identifying
               strengths and weaknesses of a firm as they relate to a firm’s current strategies, paying careful
               attention to strengths and weaknesses that are unique and lead to or hinder sustaining a com-
               petitive advantage. An internal assessment reveals key strengths and weaknesses confronting an
               organization; this is vital information for managers in formulating strategies that capitalize on
               strengths and mitigate/overcome/improve upon weaknesses.

               The Actionable-Quantitative-Comparative-Divisional (AQCD) Test
               When identifying and prioritizing key internal factors in strategic planning, make sure the factors
               selected meet the following four criteria to the extent possible:
                   1. Actionable (i.e., meaningful and helpful in ultimately deciding what actions or strategies a
                      firm should consider pursuing);
                   2. Quantitative (i.e., include percentages, ratios, dollars, and numbers to the extent possible);
                   3. Comparative (i.e., reveals changes over time), and
                   4. Divisional (relates to the firm’s products and/or regions (rather than consolidated) so infer-
                      ences can be drawn regarding what products and regions are doing well or not).
                    As mentioned in the prior chapter, factors that meet the four criteria pass what can be called
               the “Actionable-Quantitative-Comparative-Divisional (AQCD) Test,” that is a measure of the
               quality of an internal factor. In addition to passing the AQCD Test, make sure that internal fac-
               tors are indeed internal (not external). Also, make sure the internal factors relate closely to the
               firm achieving its mission (strengths) or hindering its mission (weaknesses). Factors selected for
               inclusion in an internal assessment should be mission-driven.
                    Regarding the AQCD criteria, strive to include all high quality factors in an internal assess-
               ment for a firm. A high quality factor will meet three or four of the AQCD criteria; a low quality
               factor will meet two or fewer of the AQCD criteria. Engage in an engineering hunt for facts to
               make sure as many factors as possible pass the AQCD Test. It is important to state internal factors
               to the extent possible in actionable, quantitative, comparative, and divisional terms. Vagueness in
               stating factors must be avoided because vagueness gives little guidance in assigning weights or
               ratings in developing an IFE Matrix.
                    High quality and low quality internal factors (hypothetical) for Exxon Mobil Corporation
               are given below to further exemplify this important concept:

    142    PART 2 • STRATEGY FORMULATION

                                  Steps in Developing an IFE Matrix
                                  An internal strategic-management audit includes development of an Internal Factor Evaluation
                                  (IFE) Matrix. This strategy-formulation tool weights and rates major strengths and weaknesses
                                  in the functional areas of a business, providing a total weighted score indicating the overall
                                  strength of a firm’s internal position. The IFE Matrix is an evaluation of the effectiveness of the
                                  firm’s current strategies, not taking into account opportunities and threats. The purpose of the
                                  IFE Matrix and the internal assessment as a whole is to determine how effective the firm’s cur-
                                  rent strategies are based on the firm’s strengths and weaknesses.
                                       Strategists analyze the firm’s response to key strengths and weaknesses (the ratings in step 3)
                                  in relation to the importance of these factors within the industry it operates (the weights in step 2).
                                  The resulting total weighted score (step 5) indicates the internal effectiveness of the current
                                  strategy. The IFE Matrix total weighted score is suggestive of whether a continuation of strategy
                                  is needed (scores above 2.5) or a change in strategy is warranted (scores below 2.5). Used in
                                  conjunction with the EFE Matrix and CPM discussed in Chapter 3, the IFE Matrix provides the
                                  input needed to perform strategy-matching analyses described in Chapter 6.
                                      An IFE Matrix can be developed in five steps:

                                  Step 1: Develop a Full and Narrow List of Key Internal Factors
                                  Conduct research about the focal company using the resources listed in Table 4.8. Compile
                                  and organize information into two data sets, strengths and weaknesses, developing a full list of
                                  perhaps 50 to 100 strength and weakness factors. Be sure to include factors from management,
                                  marketing, finance, accounting, and MIS that are of strategic importance. Then, narrow your
                                  data sets down to 20 key internal factors that include specifically 10 strengths and 10 weak-
                                  nesses. (Note: We use 10 and 10 because organizations commonly use this breakdown and the
                                  template at www.strategyclub.com uses 10 and 10). List strengths first and then weaknesses.
                                       Firms determine the most important 20 factors among a full list usually by rating the factors
                                  according to importance (1 = least important to 10 = most important) and consolidating the rat-
                                  ing data or by ranking the factors (1 = most important to 50 = least important) and consolidating
                                  the ranking data. Both methods will yield the 20 most important factors to include. The impor-
                                  tant point here is that companies (and students) never should include just the first 20 factors
                                  that come to mind. For example, a student recently included as a weakness in her IFE Matrix
                                  for a college that “there are feral cats on campus”; 99 percent of the time that factor should not
                                  be included in the matrix. Instead, conduct research to identify internal factors that relate to the
                                  university’s vision, mission, strategies, and competitive advantages.
                                       When determining particular factors to include in an IFE Matrix and when assigning weights
                                  and ratings, focus on a narrow industry perspective. Within the narrow industry, consider the
                                  vision and mission of the firm, and the firm’s current strategies (i.e., when selecting factors and
                                  assigning weights and ratings). For example, for McDonald’s, the industry is fast-food restau-
                                  rants, rather than restaurants in general, and for Porsche, the industry is luxury sports cars, not
                                  simply automobiles. This narrow industry perspective is important, as indicated in Table 4-10.

                                  Step 2: Assign Weights to Key Internal Factors
                                  In developing an IFE Matrix, assign a weight that ranges from 0.01 (not important) to 1.0 (all-
                                  important) for each factor. The weight assigned to a given factor indicates the relative impor-
                                  tance of the factor for being successful in the firm’s industry relative to other factors included
                                  in the IFE. For example, a factor receiving a weight of 0.04 is 100 percent more important than
                                  a factor receiving a weight of 0.02 for success in the industry. Regardless of whether a key fac-
                                  tor for a particular firm is a strength or weakness, factors considered to have the greatest effect
                                  on organizational performance of all firms in a specific industry should be assigned the highest
                                  weights. The sum of all weights must equal 1.0. Do not try to even weights out to total 0.50
                                  for strengths and 0.50 for weaknesses. Weights are industry-based, not company-based. List
                                  strengths from highest weight to lowest weight; do the same for weaknesses.

                                  Step 3: Assign Ratings to Key Internal Factors
                                  In developing an IFE Matrix, assign a rating between 1 and 4 to each key internal factor to
                                  indicate how effectively (or ineffectively) the firm’s strategies are responding to the strength

                   1. Use the Narrow (Not Broad) Industry the Firm Competes In
                      Example: Burger King competes in the fast-food industry (as opposed to the more general restaurant
                      industry). Therefore, for Burger King, if including a weakness regarding the lack of healthy options
                      on their menu, this factor should likely receive a low weight because healthy menu options are not as
                      vital to the fast-food industry, whose customer base mostly desire quick service, good taste, and filling
                      food. Similarly, Burger King’s weakness related to low-quality meats should not receive a high weight
                      either because quality meats are not that important in the fast-food industry; customers simply are not
                      willing to pay for them. Similarly, Burger King’s strength of providing low-priced coffee would re-
                      ceive a high weight if the analyst views coffee as being especially important in the fast-food industry
                      for success. If however the analysts views coffee not to be especially important in the fast-food indus-
                      try for success, then this strength of Burger King should receive a relatively low weight.
                   2. State Factors So They Pass the Actionable-Quantitative-Comparative-Divisional (AQCD) Test
                      Example: A firm’s revenues may have decreased 15 percent from one year to the next, but stated in this
                      manner, this “weakness” is not actionable because it does not reveal the reason, or reasons, why rev-
                      enues declined; the reason(s) could range from competition driving down prices to raw materials being
                      unavailable for one product or division of the firm. Nonactionable factors could lead managers astray
                      if they make false assumptions regarding what to do about the factor. Therefore, state the “revenue
                      decline factor” perhaps as follows: Revenues in the chocolate segment of the firm declined 21 percent
                      in the most recent quarter because of factory recall problems. Now the factor passes the AQCD Test in
                      providing insightful, relevant, useful, information for formulating strategies.



               or weakness, where 4 = the response is superior, 3 = the response is above average, 2 = the
               response is average, and 1 = the response is poor. Even though both strengths and weaknesses
               can receive a rating of 1, 2, 3, or 4 at any time, generally there should be a compelling reason
               to assign a rating of 3 or 4 to a weakness; it is more common for a firm to be responding in a
               superior fashion to strengths because competitive advantages are built on strengths; strategies
               that result in strengths are generally excellent. Responding well to a weakness may not lead to
               competitive advantage, whereas turning a strength into a distinctive competency could yield a
               competitive advantage. Ratings are based on the effectiveness of a firm’s strategies in capital-
               izing on strengths or improving weaknesses. Ratings are company-based, not industry-based.
                    Assignment of numerical values down the rating column in an IFE Matrix should be with
               consideration that companies carve out niches in industries that enable them to gain and sus-
               tain competitive advantages through effective strategies. These niches are most often based on
               some unique strength(s) that yield prosperity amid rivals that are so strong in various areas the
               focal firm will rarely, if ever, want to attack those areas. This is not to say weaknesses are not
               important because they are, and firms need to continually strive to improve weaknesses, but
               strengths versus rivals are of paramount importance. If a firm possesses many highly-weighted
               strengths, this is likely the result of effective strategies, so higher ratings in general are warranted
               for strengths; higher ratings increase the total weighted score in an IFE Matrix.


               Step 4: Obtain Weighted Scores
               Along each row in an IFE Matrix, multiply the factor’s weight by its rating to determine a
               weighted score for each factor.


               Step 5: Obtain Total Weighted Score
               Sum the weighted scores to determine the total weighted score for the organization. Regardless
               of how many factors are included in an IFE Matrix, the total weighted score can range from a
               low of 1.0 to a high of 4.0, with the average score being 2.5. Total weighted scores well below
               2.5 characterize organizations that are weak internally, implying that new strategies are likely
               needed and perhaps a new direction, new vision, or mission. Total weighted scores well above
               2.5 indicate a strong internal position, whereby a continuation of current strategies may be pru-
               dent. (Note: The IE Matrix presented in Chapter 6 focuses on matching of EFE and IFE total
               weighted scores in formulating strategies.)

                                  An Example IFE Matrix
                                  An example IFE Matrix is provided in Table 4-11 for a retail computer store. The table reveals that
                                  the two most important factors to be successful in the retail computer store business (as indicated
                                  by the highest weighted factors) are Strength #1: “Revenues from repair/service in the store,”
                                  and Weakness #1: Location of store negatively impacted by new Highway 34. Note that among
                                  the strengths, the store’s strategies are not responding well (rating is 2) to two factors: “Average
                                  customer purchase increased from $97 to $128” and “Debt-to-total assets ratio declines to 34%,”
                                  as indicated by the assigned 2 ratings. Regarding the store’s weaknesses, note that the owner’s
                                  strategies are responding “superior” to two factors: (1) “Location of store negatively impacted by
                                  new Highway 34,” as indicated by the rating of 4 (because plans are underway to perhaps relocate
                                  the store), and (2) “Bathroom needs refurbishing,” as indicated by the rating of 4 (because the
                                  bathroom is in the process of being remodeled). Note that the store’s IFE Matrix overall contains

                                       Coupled with the EFE Matrix, the IFE Matrix provides important information for strategy
                                  formulation. For example, this retail computer store might want to hire another checkout person
                                  and repair its carpet and paint. Also, the store may want to increase advertising for its repair/ser-
                                  vices, because that is a really important (weight 0.15) factor to being successful in this business.
                                       In multidivisional firms, each autonomous division or strategic business unit should con-
                                  struct their own IFE Matrix (and their own EFE Matrix). Divisional matrices then can be inte-
                                  grated to develop an overall corporate IFE Matrix. Be as divisional as possible when developing
                                  a corporate IFE Matrix. Also, in developing an IFE Matrix, do not allow more than 30 percent
                                  of the key factors to be financial ratios. Financial ratios are generally the result of many fac-
                                  tors, so it is difficult to know what particular strategies should be considered based on financial
                                  ratios. For example, a firm would have no insight on whether to sell in Brazil or South Africa to
                                  take advantage of a high corporate ROI ratio.

                                           to be judged solely on their bottom-line performance. However, it is essential that strategists
                                           identify and evaluate internal strengths and weaknesses to effectively formulate and choose
                                           among alternative strategies. The IFE Matrix, coupled with the CPM, the EFE Matrix, and
                                           clear statements of vision and mission provide the basic information needed to successfully
                                           formulate competitive strategies. The process of performing an internal audit represents an
                                           opportunity for managers and employees throughout the organization to participate in deter-
                                           mining the future of the firm. Involvement in the process can energize and mobilize manag-
                                           ers and employees.
                                                Understanding both external and internal factors and relationships among them (see
                                           SWOT analysis in Chapter 6) is the key to effective strategy formulation. Because both
                                           external and internal factors continually change, strategists seek to identify and take ad-
                                           vantage of positive changes and buffer against negative changes in a continuing effort
                                           to gain and sustain a firm’s competitive advantage. This is the essence and challenge of

               Purpose
               Financial ratio analysis is one of the best techniques for identifying and evaluating internal strengths
               and weaknesses. Potential investors and current shareholders look closely at firms’ financial ratios,
               making detailed comparisons to industry averages and to previous periods of time. Financial ratio
               analyses provide vital input information for developing an IFE Matrix.

               Purpose
               This exercise will give you experience in developing an IFE Matrix. Identifying and prioritizing
               factors to include in an IFE Matrix fosters communication among functional and divisional man-
               agers. Preparing an IFE Matrix allows managers to articulate their concerns and thoughts regard-
               ing the business condition of the firm. This results in an improved collective understanding of the
               business.

                                  This exercise gives you the opportunity to evaluate your own personal strengths and weaknesses.
                                  As will become clearer in the next chapter, an organization’s strategies are largely based on striving
                                  to take advantage of strengths and improving on weaknesses. Similarly, in planning for your career,
                                  you should formulate and implement personal strategies based on capitalizing on your strengths and
                                  improving on your weaknesses.
                                  Instructions
                                  Step 1         Develop an IFE Matrix for yourself. As you assign weights, consider the relative importance
                                                 of each factor for success in your desired career.

                                  What Internal Functional Areas Are Most ­Important
                                  to Examine in Strategic Planning?
                                  Purpose
                                  A prioritized list of internal factors is needed for effective strategic planning. Often, the process en-
                                  tails all managers individually ranking the factors identified, from 1 (most important) to 20 (least
                                  important). Prioritization is absolutely essential in strategic planning because no organization can do
                                  everything that would benefit the firm; tough choices among good choices have to be made.
                                       Internal functional areas that yield strengths/weaknesses can be divided into five broad categories
                                  or areas: (1) management, (2) marketing, (3) finance, (4) accounting, and (5) MIS. For some compa-
                                  nies or organizations at various times, some areas are more important than others. This exercise re-
                                  veals the authors’ ranking of the relative importance of six functional areas for inclusion in a strategic
                                  planning internal assessment.
                                       The purpose of this exercise is to examine more closely the functional areas of business. In ad-
                                  dition, the purpose of this exercise is to examine whether individual decision making is better than
                                  group decision making. Academic research suggests that groups make better decisions than individu-
                                  als about 80 percent of the time.
                                  Instructions
                                  Rank five internal areas as to their relative importance (1 = most important, 5 = least important) in
                                  doing strategic planning. First, rank the areas as an individual. Then, rank the areas as a group of
                                  three. Thus, determine what person(s) and what group(s) here today can come closest to the expert
                                  ranking. This exercise enables examination of the relative effectiveness of individual versus group
                                  decision making in strategic planning.
                                  Steps
                                   1. Fill in Column 1 in Table 4-12 to reveal your individual ranking of the relative importance of
                                      the six areas (1 = most important, 2 = next most important, etc.). For example, if you feel man-
                                      agement is the third-most important functional area in doing strategic planning, then enter a 3 in

                                   2. Fill in Column 2 in Table 4-12 to reveal your group’s ranking of the relative importance of the
                                      five areas (1 = most important, 2 = next most important, etc.).
                                   3. Fill in Column 3 in Table 4-12 to reveal the expert’s ranking of the relative importance of the
                                      five functional areas.

                   Column 5 sum, then you performed better as an individual than as a group. Normally, group
                   decision making is superior to individual decision making, so if you did better than your group,
                   you did excellent.

                 IN THE UNITED STATES?
                 The answer could be P&G. Ratings by the Drucker Institute on overall corporate effectiveness show
                 that P&G is certainly among the most effectively managed firms in the United States. P&G CEO,
                 David Taylor, explains that, “Every day P&G people work to serve consumers with superior brands
                 and reward shareholders with balanced, sustainable long-term growth and value creation. This rec-
                 ognition is further validation that we are on the right track.”
                     The Drucker Institute analyzes performance of companies across the functional areas of busi-
                 ness, including more than 35 metrics, such as market-share data, patents, and employee ratings.
                 Information is collected and analyzed to determine how well companies are doing according to
                 Drucker’s core principles: customer satisfaction, financial strength, employee development, inno-
                 vation, and corporate social responsibility. P&G received exceptionally high scores on innovation,
                 social responsibility, and financial strength.
                     P&G competes in the consumer-products industry. The company’s finance chief, Jon Moeller,
                 explains that P&G wants to focus on product categories that are used daily, such as toothpaste and
                 soap, so of late has narrowed its product mix, disposing of underperforming brands and cutting
                 back from more than 100 brands to around 65. Simultaneously, P&G has cut over 20,000 jobs and
                 trimmed nearly $10 billion in costs. P&G puts its cash to good use and is considered a “dividend
                 king” by some experts. P&G Chief Information Officer, Javier Polit, explained that “What was pre-
                 viously cost-prohibitive is now cost-effective with the use of the cloud. We’re about to forecast now
                 in ways we couldn’t before. We’ve seen improvements in regard to the quantity of raw materials we
                 buy, and the costs associated with ship and restock.”

                                         As stated by CEO David Taylor, “it is a combination of a few key capabilities that determine
                                      whether any company will be successful, especially “superior products that delight customers,” “ex-

                                                     undreds of companies today have embraced strategic planning in their quest for higher
                                                     revenues and profits. Kent Nelson, former chair and CEO of UPS, explains why his com-
                                                     pany created a new strategic-planning department: “Because we’re making bigger bets
                                            on investments in technology, we can’t afford to spend a whole lot of money in one direction and
                                            then find out five years later it was the wrong direction.”1 As illustrated in Figure 5-1, long-term
                                            objectives are needed before strategies can be generated, evaluated, and selected.
                                                 This chapter brings strategic management to life with many contemporary examples.
                                            Different types of strategies are defined and exemplified, including Michael Porter’s generic
                                            strategies: cost leadership and differentiation. Guidelines are presented for determining when
                                            each strategy is most appropriate to pursue. The integral importance of value chain analysis and
                                            benchmarking in strategic planning is revealed. An overview of strategic management in non-

                                  LO 5.1    Long-Term Objectives
                                            Long-term objectives represent the results expected from pursuing certain strategies. Strategies
                                            represent the actions to be taken to accomplish long-term objectives. The time frame for objec-
                                            tives and strategies should be consistent, usually from 2 to 5 years. Without long-term objectives,
                                            an organization would drift aimlessly toward some unknown end or become too focused on
                                            short-term fads and stray away from the firm’s mission.
                                                 It is hard to imagine an organization or an individual being successful without clear objec-
                                            tives. You probably have worked hard the last few years striving to achieve an objective to gradu-
                                            ate with a business degree. Success rarely occurs by accident; rather, it is the result of hard work
                                            directed toward achieving certain objectives.

                                            Characteristics and Benefits of Objectives
                                            Objectives should be quantitative, understandable, challenging, compatible (consistent vertically
                                            and horizontally in a chain of command), and obtainable. Each objective should also be associ-
                                            ated with a timeline. Objectives are commonly stated in terms such as growth in assets, growth




    EXEMPLARY STRATEGIST SHOWCASED

    Tim Cook, CEO of Apple, Inc.
    The editor of Businessweek, Megan Murphy, recently asked the CEO of
    Apple, Tim Cook, what he thought his legacy at Apple would be. Tim re-
    sponded: “To be honest I don’t think about it; I think about doing stuff.”                                                                         Ildogesto/Shutterstock
    Cook went on to explain how and why Apple’s founder, Steve Jobs,
    rather than himself, should be the person revered forever as Apple’s
    supreme strategist extraordinaire. Cook told Megan that Apple in the
    past, present, and future is all about its founder Jobs. Tim explained that
    Job’s “DNA” or “ethos” is and always will be Apple’s “Constitution” or
    guiding set of principles. According to Cook, Jobs’s ethos ingrained into
    Apple forever include the following items (paraphrased):
       1. Pay acute attention to detail.                                           7. Walk away and be honest with yourself when you do something
       2. Keep it simple and genuinely care.                                          wrong.
       3. Focus on the user and user experience.                                   8. Never get married to your position or pride.
       4. Focus on building the best.                                              9. Invest for the long-term rather than striving to be the first to
       5. Follow the motto “good isn’t good enough”; every product and                market with a product.
          process must be, as Jobs’s often said, “insanely great.”

               in sales, profitability, market share, degree and nature of diversification, degree and nature of
               vertical integration, earnings per share, and social responsibility. (Note: Do not emulate many
               Annual Reports that print really vague objectives for the firm, such as Macy’s Annual Report that
               states as objectives “to grow sales profitably” and “to improve return on invested capital.” Such
               statements are useless in strategic planning.
                    Clearly established objectives offer many benefits. They provide direction, allow synergy, assist
               in evaluation, establish priorities, reduce uncertainty, minimize conflicts, stimulate exertion, and aid
               in both the allocation of resources and the design of jobs. Objectives provide a basis for consistent
               decision making by managers whose values and attitudes differ. Objectives serve as standards by
               which individuals, groups, departments, divisions, and entire organizations can be evaluated.

               having clear objectives.

               Financial versus Strategic Objectives
               Two types of objectives are especially common in organizations: financial and strategic objec-
               tives. Financial objectives include those associated with growth in revenues, growth in earn-
               ings, higher dividends, larger profit margins, greater return on investment, higher earnings per
               share, a rising stock price, improved cash flow, and all other objectives relating to the financial
               position of the firm, whereas strategic objectives focus on goals for obtaining a competitive
               advantage, including factors such as a larger market share, quicker on-time delivery than rivals,
               lower costs than rivals, higher product quality than rivals, wider geographic coverage than rivals,
               achieving technological leadership, and consistently getting new or improved products to mar-
               ket ahead of rivals.
                    Often there is a trade-off between financial and strategic objectives such that crucial deci-
               sions have to be made. For example, a firm can do certain activities to maximize short-term
               financial objectives that would harm long-term strategic objectives. To improve financial posi-
               tion in the short run through higher prices may, for example, jeopardize long-term market share.
               The dangers associated with trading off long-term strategic objectives with near-term bottom-
               line performance are especially severe if competitors relentlessly pursue increased market share
               at the expense of short-term profitability. Amazon, for example, operated for decades without
               concern for profits, instead concentrating on gaining market share. There are other trade-offs
               between financial and strategic objectives, related to riskiness of actions, concern for business
               ethics, the need to preserve the natural environment, and social responsibility issues. Both fi-
               nancial and strategic objectives should include annual and long-term performance targets.

                                           Ultimately, the best way to sustain competitive advantage is to relentlessly pursue strategic ob-
                                           jectives that strengthen a firm’s business position over rivals.

                                           Avoid Managing by Crisis, Hope, Extrapolation, and Mystery (CHEM)
                                           Derek Bok, former President of Harvard University, once said, “If you think education is expen-
                                           sive, try ignorance.” The idea behind this saying also applies to establishing objectives because
                                           strategists should avoid managing by CHEM.
                                            •   Managing By Crisis—Based on the belief that the true measure of a really good strate-
                                                gist is the ability to solve problems. Because there are plenty of crises and problems to go
                                                around for every person and organization, strategists ought to bring their time and c­ reative
                                                energy to bear on solving the most pressing problems of the day. Managing by crisis is
                                                actually a form of reacting, letting events dictate the what and when of management
                                                decisions.
                                            •   Managing By Hope—Based on the fact that the future is laden with great uncertainty and
                                                that if we try and do not succeed, then we hope our second (or third) attempt will suc-
                                                ceed. Decisions are predicated on the hope that they will work and that good times are just
                                                around the corner, especially if luck and good fortune are on our side.
                                            •   Managing By Extrapolation—Adheres to the principle “If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it.” The
                                                idea is to keep on doing the same things in the same ways because things are going well.
                                            •   Managing By Mystery—Built on the idea that there is no general plan for which way to go and
                                                what to do; just do the best you can to accomplish what you think should be done. In short, “Do
                                                your own thing, the best way you know how” (sometimes referred to as the mystery approach
                                                to decision making because subordinates are left to figure out what is happening and why).2

                                  LO 5.2   Types of Strategies
                                           Defined and exemplified in Table 5-3, alternative strategies that an enterprise could pursue can
                                           be categorized into 11 actions: forward integration, backward integration, horizontal integration,
                                           market penetration, market development, product development, related diversification, unrelated
                                           diversification, retrenchment, divestiture, and liquidation. Each alternative strategy has countless
                                           variations. For example, market penetration can include adding salespersons, increasing adver-
                                           tising expenditures, couponing, and using similar actions to increase market share in a given
                                           geographic area. Note for a particular company the strategy is very specific; be specific to the
                                           extent possible in all aspects of strategic planning.
                                                Most organizations simultaneously pursue a combination of two or more strategies, but a
                                           combination strategy can be exceptionally risky if carried too far. No organization can afford to
                                           pursue all the strategies that might benefit the firm; priorities must be established. Difficult deci-
                                           sions must be made. Organizations, like individuals, have limited resources. Both organizations
                                           and individuals must choose among alternative strategies and avoid excessive indebtedness.

                    Strategic planning thus involves “choices that risk resources, and trade-offs that sacrifice
               opportunity.” In other words, if you have a strategy to go north, then you must buy snowshoes
               and warm jackets (spend resources) and forgo the opportunity of “faster population growth in
               southern states.” You cannot have a strategy to go north and then take a step east, south, or west
               “just to be on the safe side.” Strategy is all about “what to do” and “what not to do.”
                    Firms spend resources and focus on a finite number of opportunities in pursuing strategies
               to achieve an uncertain outcome in the future. Strategic planning is much more than a roll of the
               dice; it is an educated wager based on predictions and hypotheses that are continually tested and
               refined by knowledge, research, experience, and learning. Survival of the firm often hinges on an
               excellent strategic plan.3
                    Organizations cannot excel in multiple different strategic pursuits because resources and
               talents get spread thin and competitors gain advantage. In large, diversified companies, a com-
               bination strategy is commonly employed when different divisions pursue different strategies.
               Organizations struggling to survive may simultaneously employ a combination of several defen-
               sive strategies, such as divestiture and retrenchment.

               Levels of Strategies
               Strategy making is not just a task for top executives. Middle- and lower-level managers also must be
               involved in the strategic-planning process to the extent possible. In large firms, there are actually four
               levels of strategies: corporate, divisional, functional, and operational—as illustrated in Figure 5-2.
               However, in small firms, there are three levels of strategies: company, functional, and operational.

                                                The persons primarily responsible for having effective strategies at the various levels
                                           include the CEO at the corporate level; the president of segments at the divisional level;
                                           the chief finance officer (CFO), chief information officer (CIO), human resource manager
                                           (HRM), chief marketing officer (CMO), other executives at the functional level, and the
                                           plant manager, regional sales manager, and so on at the operational level. It is important that
                                           all managers at all levels participate and understand the firm’s strategic plan to help ensure
                                           coordination, facilitation, and commitment, while avoiding inconsistency, inefficiency, and
                                           miscommunication.
                                                Long-term objectives are needed at the corporate, divisional, functional, and opera-
                                           tional levels of an organization. They are an important measure of managerial performance.
                                           Bonuses or merit pay for managers today should be based to a greater extent on long-term
                                           objectives and strategies. An example framework for relating objectives to performance
                                           evaluation is provided in Table 5-4. A particular organization could tailor these guidelines
                                           to meet their own needs, but incentives should be attached to both long-term and annual
                                           objectives.

                                  LO 5.3   Integration Strategies
                                           Forward integration and backward integration are sometimes collectively referred to as verti-
                                           cal integration. Vertical integration strategies allow a firm to gain control over distributors
                                           and suppliers, whereas horizontal integration refers to gaining ownership or control over
                                           competitors. Vertical and horizontal actions by firms are broadly referred to as integration
                                           strategies.
                                                Historically, vertical integration strategies have been difficult to implement because of
                                           the firm operating in businesses out of its core competency, and because large fixed costs are
                                           generally associated with such strategies. For example, if Coke wished to vertically integrate,
                                           it could acquire sugar farms to gain control over its suppliers and open its own brick-and-
                                           mortar stores to gain control of distributors. Both would be excessively costly and divert
                                           Coke from what it does best: producing beverage products. Although the risk of depending
                                           on suppliers and distributors may be high, owning these businesses is often associated with
                                           even greater risks. Viable options to vertical integration are joint ventures and strategic alli-
                                           ances discussed later in the chapter. Opportunity costs associated with the resources used for
                                           vertical integration usually could be more effectively deployed to other endeavors.

                                           Forward Integration
                                           Forward integration involves gaining ownership or increased control over distributors or retail­
                                           ers as a means of moving closer to the end customer and cutting out the middleman. Increasing
                                           numbers of manufacturers (suppliers) are pursuing forward integration to market the products
                                           they produce. For example, Nike sells millions of shoes and shirts in a variety of retail stores rang-
                                           ing from Foot Locker to J. C. Penney, but the company is rapidly boosting its direct-­to-consumer
                                           business, bypassing, and in some cases infuriating, retail stores. Nike’s forward-­integration

               strategy has hundreds of retail stores upset; sales on the Nike.com website recently rose 50 per-
               cent. By 2020, Nike projects that its direct sales to consumers will exceed $16 billion annually
               and account for one-third of the company’s revenue. At the three largest publicly traded U.S.
               athletic retailers, Finish Line, Foot Locker, and Dick’s Sporting Goods, the percentage of their
               merchandise that comes from Nike is 73, 73, and 19 percent, respectively, so these firms must
               adapt or face disaster.
                    Forward integration is an increasingly popular strategy among U.S.-based restaurants.
               Scores of mainstream restaurant chains now use or are developing online-ordering apps that often
               entail delivery of food to customers. For example, Panera Bread has installed online-­ordering
               and delivery in about 50 percent of its restaurants. Panera employs more than 10,000 of its own
               delivery drivers. Similarly, Dunkin’ Brands is now delivering doughnuts and coffee in Dallas,
               Atlanta, Chicago, Los Angeles, and numerous other cities. Chipotle Mexican Grill has instituted
               a second food assembly line in its restaurants to accommodate delivery and online orders. Taco
               Bell now takes online orders and delivers in more than 50 markets through nearly 1,000 Taco
               Bell restaurants. Online ordering and delivery of restaurant food in general is expected to soon
               surpass pizzas.
                    An effective means of implementing forward integration is franchising. Approximately
               2,000 companies in about 50 different industries in the United States use franchising to distrib-
               ute their products or services. Businesses can expand rapidly by franchising because costs and
               opportunities are spread among many individuals. Total sales by franchises in the United States
               exceed $1 trillion annually. There are about 800,000 franchise businesses in the U.S. Subway
               is today in turmoil as the 100 percent franchised firm has mostly franchisees that disagree with
               top executives on the overall vision and mission of the firm. Year 2017 was the fourth consecu-
               tive year of declining sales at Subway. Top executives want to continue adding stores to the over
               25,000 in the U.S., but franchisees cannot take further cannibalization caused by new Subways
               opening nearby. Instead, franchisees want more control over their supplier choices, more ad-
               vertising from corporate, more flexibility on what promotions to participate in, more R&D to
               enhance a menu that has not changed much in a decade, and permission to add drive-through
               services.
                    The following six guidelines indicate when forward integration may be an especially effec-
               tive strategy:4
                   1. An organization’s present distributors are especially expensive, unreliable, or incapable of
                      meeting the firm’s distribution needs.
                   2. The availability of quality distributors is so limited a rival could potentially sign an exclu-
                      sive contract, thus locking down a competitive advantage.
                   3. An organization competes in an industry that is growing and is expected to continue to
                      grow markedly; this is a factor because forward integration reduces an organization’s abil-
                      ity to diversify if its basic industry falters.
                   4. An organization has both the capital and human resources needed to manage the new busi-
                      ness of distributing its own products.
                   5. The advantages of stable production are particularly high; this is a consideration because
                      an organization can increase the predictability of the demand for its output through forward
                      integration.
                   6. Present distributors or retailers have high-profit margins; this situation suggests that a
                      ­company could profitably distribute its own products and price them more competitively
                       by integrating forward.

               Backward Integration
               Backward integration is a strategy of seeking ownership or increased control of a firm’s sup-
               pliers. This strategy can be especially appropriate when a firm’s current suppliers are unreliable,
               too costly, or cannot meet the firm’s needs. Starbucks recently purchased its first coffee farm—a
               ­600-acre property in Costa Rica. This backward integration strategy was used primarily to de-
                velop new coffee varieties and to test methods to combat a fungal disease known as coffee rust
                that plagues the industry. Manufacturers, as well as retailers, purchase needed materials from

                                       Consolidation in the aircraft parts industry has resulted in increased prices of these parts,
                                  which has prompted Boeing and Airbus to begin producing many aircraft parts internally. Boeing
                                  is constructing a plant in England that will produce motors that aid in the movement of wing
                                  flaps. Airbus CEO Fabrice Bregier commented on how the firm continually reviews “make-or-
                                  buy” decisions on most of its components used in aircraft construction.
                                       Some industries, such as automotive and aluminum producers, are reducing their histori-
                                  cal pursuit of backward integration; this practice is called de-integration. Instead of owning
                                  their suppliers, companies negotiate with outside suppliers. Ford and Chrysler buy more than
                                  half of their component parts from outside suppliers such as TRW, Eaton, General Electric
                                  (GE), and Johnson Controls. This makes sense in industries that have global sources of sup-
                                  ply. Companies today shop around, play one seller against another, and go with the best deal.
                                  Global competition is also spurring firms to reduce their number of suppliers and to demand
                                  higher levels of service and quality from those they keep. Although traditionally relying on
                                  many suppliers to ensure uninterrupted supplies and low prices, many U.S. firms now are
                                  following the lead of Japanese firms, which have far fewer suppliers and closer, long-term
                                  relationships with those few. “Keeping track of so many suppliers is onerous,” said Mark
                                  Shimelonis, formerly of Xerox.
                                       Four major U.S. hospital systems recently launched a nonprofit company to produce ge-
                                  neric drugs in order to offset skyrocketing prices of drugs. The four firms are Intermountain
                                  Healthcare, Ascension, SSM Health, and Trinity Health; these four organizations own hundreds
                                  of hospitals.
                                       Seven guidelines when backward integration may be an especially effective strategy are:5
                                   1. An organization’s present suppliers are especially expensive, unreliable, or incapable of
                                      meeting the firm’s needs for parts, components, assemblies, or raw materials.
                                   2. The number of suppliers is small and the number of competitors is large.
                                   3. An organization competes in an industry that is growing rapidly; this is a factor because
                                      integrative-type strategies (forward, backward, and horizontal) reduce an organization’s
                                      ability to diversify in a declining industry.
                                   4. An organization has both capital and human resources to manage the new business of sup-
                                      plying its own raw materials.
                                   5. The advantages of stable prices of raw materials are of upmost importance.
                                   6. Present suppliers have high-profit margins, which suggest that the business of supplying
                                      products or services in a given industry is a worthwhile venture.
                                   7. Whenever various resources may be needed quickly.

                                  Horizontal Integration
                                  Horizontal integration is a strategy aimed at gaining control over a firm’s competitors; this is
                                  arguably the most common growth strategy. Thousands of mergers, acquisitions, and takeovers
                                  among competitors are consummated annually and most aim for increased economies of scale,
                                  enhanced transfer of resources and competencies, reduced competition, and fewer price wars.
                                  Kenneth Davidson makes the following observation about horizontal integration:
                                     The trend towards horizontal integration seems to reflect strategists’ misgivings about their
                                     ability to operate many unrelated businesses. Mergers between direct competitors are more
                                     likely to create efficiencies than mergers between unrelated businesses, both because there
                                     is a greater potential for eliminating duplicate facilities and because the management of the
                                     acquiring firm is more likely to understand the business of the target.6
                                       Walgreens Boot Alliance recently purchased two thousand Rite Aid stores; the remaining
                                  two thousand Rite Aid stores are being acquired by Albertsons Companies LLC. Horizontal inte-
                                  gration is often met with legal antitrust challenges as the one displayed with Walgreens and Rite
                                  Aid, which took the Federal Trade Commission 18 months before giving final approval of the
                                  deal.
                                       The largest merger of homebuilders in 10 years occurred in 2018 when Lennar Corp. ac-
                                  quired CalAtlantic Group to create a combined company with revenues more than $17 billion
                                  annually. The next largest homebuilders in the United States in rank order are D. R. Horton,
                                  PulteGroup, NVR, Toll Brothers, and KB Home.

                    Britain’s Cineworld Group PLC in 2018 acquired its U.S. counterpart Regal Entertainment
               Group for $3.6 billion, creating the world’s second-largest movie cinema operator. The com-
               bined company now has more than 9,000 movie screens. The largest firm in the industry is AMC
               Entertainment Holdings that is part of China’s Dalian Wanda Group. Cinemark Holdings is the
               third-largest cinema chain in the United States.
                    The following six guidelines indicate when horizontal integration may be an especially ef-
               fective strategy:7
                   1. An organization can gain monopolistic characteristics in a particular area or region with-
                      out being challenged by the federal government for “tending substantially” to reduce
                      competition.
                   2. An organization competes in a growing industry.
                   3. Increased economies of scale provide major competitive advantages.
                   4. An organization has both the capital and human talent needed to successfully manage an
                      expanded organization.
                   5. When competitors are faltering and can be acquired at a discount.
                   6. When a firm desires to enter a new geographic market quickly.



               Intensive Strategies                                                                                 LO 5.4
               Market penetration, market development, and product development are sometimes referred to as
               intensive strategies because they require intensive efforts if a firm’s competitive position with
               existing products is to improve. Intensive strategies are normally good options because they
               involve a firm sticking to what it does best with the only variation being (1) redoubling your
               effort (market penetration), (2) taking what it does best on the “road” (market development), or
               (3) improving on what it does best (product development). In contrast, forward and backward
               integration and diversification strategies take firms away from their core products, services, or
               competencies.

               Market Penetration
               A market penetration strategy seeks to increase market share for present products or ser-
               vices in present markets through greater marketing efforts. This strategy is widely used alone
               and in combination with other strategies. Market penetration includes increasing the number
               of salespersons, increasing advertising expenditures, offering extensive sales promotions, or
               ­increasing publicity efforts. For example, Verizon is spending millions of dollars on a new
                advertising theme named “Humanability” that tells stories about how Verizon’s ­technology
                products are easing traffic flow, keeping fish fresh in transit, and supporting advancements in
                virtual surgery and health care; this new theme replaces Verizon’s “Can You Hear Me Now?”
                theme.
                     The following five guidelines indicate when market penetration may be an especially effec-
                tive strategy:8
                   1. Current markets are not saturated with a particular product or service.
                   2. The usage rate of present customers could be increased significantly.
                   3. The market shares of major competitors have been declining, whereas total industry sales
                      have been increasing.
                   4. The correlation between dollar sales and dollar marketing expenditures historically has
                      been high.
                   5. Increased economies of scale provide major competitive advantages.

               Market Development
               Market development involves introducing present products or services into new geographic
               areas. Tesla will soon manufacture (and sell) cars in China based on the Chinese government’s
               plans to relax restrictions on automakers needing a local partner. For thousands of firms, market
               development means adding facilities and operations globally. The Global Capsule 5 reveals a key
               variable used to determine where we should concentrate new business.

                                            1. New channels of distribution are available that are reliable, inexpensive, and of good quality.
                                            2. An organization is successful at what it does.
                                            3. New untapped or unsaturated markets exist.
                                            4. An organization has the needed capital and human resources to manage expanded
                                               operations.
                                            5. An organization has excess production capacity.
                                            6. An organization’s basic industry is rapidly becoming global in scope.
                                            7. Consumption habits of the firm’s products are similar in other geographic areas.

                                          Product Development
                                          Product development is a strategy that seeks increased sales by improving or modifying
                                          present products or services. Product development usually entails large research-and-devel-
                                          opment (R&D) expenditures. For example, Ford recently announced that up to one-third of its
                                          R&D budget scheduled for research on combustible engines would be shifted to battery and
                                          electric car research. Ford also shifted $7 billion in investment away from smaller cars into
                                          trucks and SUVs.
                                               Kellogg recently purchased RXBAR in a move to shift its product mix away from traditional
                                          sugary breakfast foods such as Frosted Flakes and Pop-Tarts, which have experienced declining
                                          sales in recent years as customers turn to more healthy options. RXBARs get their sweeteners
                                          solely from dates rather than added sugar. In a similar product development move, Campbell
                                          Soup recently acquired Pacific Foods, a firm that specializes in organic soups.

                   Automobile companies use product development extensively. Some old truck brands are
               making a comeback as Americans buy more pickups and SUVs. For example, the follow-
               ing brands are being reintroduced in the respective years given: Jeep Scrambler (2019), Jeep
               Wagoneer (2019), Chevy Blazer (2019), Ford Bronco (2020), Ford Ranger (2019), and Land
               Rover Defender (2019). The bulk of profits earned at Ford, GM, and Fiat Chrysler today come
               from pickups and SUVs.
                   Product development overall is an excellent option because a firm does not stray far from
               what it does best. The following five guidelines indicate when product development may be an
               especially effective strategy to pursue:10
                   1. An organization has successful products that are in the maturity stage of the product life
                      cycle; the idea here is to attract satisfied customers to try new (improved) products as a re-
                      sult of their positive experience with the organization’s present products or services.
                   2. An organization competes in an industry that is characterized by rapid technological
                      developments.
                   3. Major competitors offer better-quality products at comparable prices.
                   4. An organization competes in a high-growth industry.
                   5. An organization has especially strong research and development capabilities.


               Diversification Strategies                                                                                   LO 5.5
               The two general types of diversification strategies are related diversification and unrelated
               diversification. Businesses are said to be related when their value chains possess competitively
               valuable cross-business strategic fits; businesses are said to be unrelated when their value chains
               are so dissimilar that few competitively valuable cross-business relationships exist.11 Most com-
               panies favor related diversification strategies to capitalize on synergies such as follows:
                   •   Transferring competitively valuable expertise, technological know-how, or other capabili-
                       ties from one business to another
                   •   Combining related activities of separate businesses into a single operation to achieve lower costs
                   •   Exploiting common use of a well-known brand name
                   •   Cross-business collaboration to create competitively valuable resource strengths and
                       capabilities12
                    Diversification strategies are becoming less popular because organizations are finding it more
               difficult to manage diverse business activities. In the 1960s and 1970s, the trend was to diversify
               to avoid being dependent on any single industry, but the 1980s saw a general reversal of that
               thinking. Diversification is still on the retreat. Michael Porter, of the Harvard Business School,
               commented, “Management found it couldn’t manage the beast.” Businesses are still selling, clos-
               ing, or spinning off less profitable or “different” divisions to focus on their core businesses. For
               example, ITT recently divided itself into three separate, specialized companies. At one time, ITT
               owned everything from Sheraton Hotels and Hartford Insurance to the maker of Wonder Bread
               and Hostess Twinkies. About the ITT breakup, analyst Barry Knap said, “Companies generally
               are not very efficient diversifiers; investors usually can do a better job of that by purchasing stock
               in a variety of companies.” Rapidly appearing new technologies, new products, and fast-shifting
               buyer preferences make diversification difficult. Another highly diversified company, General
               Electric, is selling off many of its diversified parts.
                    Diversification must do more than simply spread business risks across different industries;
               after all, shareholders could accomplish this by simply purchasing equity in different firms across
               different industries or by investing in mutual funds. Diversification makes sense only to the ex-
               tent that the strategy adds more to shareholder value than what shareholders could accomplish
               acting individually. Any industry chosen for diversification must be attractive enough to yield
               consistently high returns on investment and offer potential synergies across the operating divi-
               sions that are greater than those entities could achieve alone. Many strategists contend that firms
               should “stick to the knitting” and not stray too far from the firms’ basic areas of competence.
                    A few companies today, however, pride themselves on being conglomerates, from small
               firms such as Pentair Inc. and Blount International to huge companies such as Textron, Berkshire
               Hathaway, Allied Signal, Emerson Electric, GE, Viacom, Amazon, Google, Disney, and Samsung.

                                           Conglomerates prove that focus and diversity are not always mutually exclusive. In an unattractive
                                           industry, diversification makes sense, such as for Philip Morris, because cigarette consumption is
                                           declining, product liability suits are a risk, and some investors reject tobacco stocks on principle.

                                           Related Diversification
                                           In a related diversification move, Walt Disney recently acquired 21st Century Fox’s film and TV stu-
                                           dios in a deal worth over $52 million. The deal included Fox-owned cable networks, including FX
                                           and National Geographic, and Fox’s stakes in international networks like Star TV, Sky, and Hulu.
                                                Five guidelines reveal when related diversification may be an effective strategy to follow:13
                                            1. An organization competes in a no-growth or a slow-growth industry.
                                            2. Adding new, but related, products would significantly enhance the sale of current products.
                                            3. New, but related, products could be offered at highly competitive prices.
                                            4. New, but related, products have seasonal sales levels that counterbalance an organization’s
                                               existing peaks and valleys.
                                            5. An organization has a strong management team.

                                           Unrelated Diversification
                                           An unrelated diversification strategy favors capitalizing on a portfolio of businesses that are capa-
                                           ble of delivering excellent financial performance in their respective industries, rather than s­ triving
                                           to capitalize on strategic fit among the businesses. Firms that employ unrelated diversification
                                           continually search across different industries for companies that can be acquired for a deal and yet
                                           have potential to provide a high return on investment. Pursuing unrelated diversification entails
                                           being on the hunt to acquire companies whose assets are undervalued, companies that are finan-
                                           cially distressed, or companies that have high-growth prospects but are short on investment capital.
                                                In an unrelated diversification move, Amazon.com is planning to enter the $412 billion phar-
                                           macy business. Today, 9 out of 10 patients pick up their prescriptions at a retail pharmacy, but
                                           Amazon is betting that home delivery of pharmaceuticals are soon to be the rule rather than the
                                           exception. Partly because of this external threat, CVS recently acquired the huge insurance firm,
                                           Aetna, Inc., in an unrelated diversification move targeted to offset their reliance on the drugstore
                                           industry, which as a whole has been experiencing faltering revenues and profits.
                                                Five guidelines reveal when unrelated diversification may be an especially effective strategy
                                           follow:14
                                            1. Existing markets for an organization’s present products are saturated.
                                            2. An organization competes in a highly competitive or a no-growth industry, as indicated by
                                               low industry profit margins and returns.
                                            3. An organization’s present channels of distribution can be used to market new products to
                                               current customers.
                                            4. New products have countercyclical sales patterns compared to an organization’s present
                                               products.
                                            5. An organization has the capital and managerial talent needed to compete successfully in a
                                               new industry.


                                  LO 5.6   Defensive Strategies
                                           In addition to integrative, intensive, and diversification strategies, organizations also could pur-
                                           sue defensive strategies such as retrenchment, divestiture, or liquidation. Retrenchment is a broad
                                           term that can include divestiture and liquidation.

                                           Retrenchment
                                           Retrenchment occurs when an organization regroups through cost and asset reduction to re-
                                           verse declining sales and profits. Sometimes called a turnaround strategy, retrenchment is de-
                                           signed to fortify an organization’s basic distinctive competence. During retrenchment, strategists

               work with limited resources and face pressure from shareholders, employees, and the media.
               Retrenchment can involve selling off land and buildings to raise needed cash, pruning product
               lines, closing marginal businesses, closing obsolete factories, automating processes, reducing the
               number of employees, and instituting expense control systems.
                      Eli Lilly is cutting 8 percent of its global workforce mostly centered on the production and mar-
               keting of existing drugs that are nearing patent expiration because competition from lower-priced
               generics is forecasted to be fierce. Eli Lilly is deploying much of the salary savings into R&D of new
               drugs.
                      The world’s largest seller of generic drugs, Teva Pharmaceutical Industries is laying off
               25 percent of its workforce, or about 14,000 employees around the world, and closing facto-
               ries and research centers, and suspending its dividend to cut costs. Headquartered in Tel Aviv,
               Israel, Teva expects its retrenchment strategy to save $3 billion in costs in 2018–2019.
                      The action-camera company, GoPro Inc. in 2018 laid off one-fifth of its workforce and ex-
               ited the drone market as part of the firm’s retrenchment strategy. As smartphone cameras and
               videos have improved, GoPro’s camera business has suffered.
                      In some cases, declaring bankruptcy can be an effective retrenchment strategy. Bankruptcy
               can allow a firm to avoid major debt obligations and to void union contracts. Chapter 7
               ­bankruptcy is a liquidation procedure used only when a corporation sees no hope of being
                able to operate successfully or to obtain the necessary creditor agreement. All the organization’s
                assets are sold in parts for their tangible worth. Several hundred thousand companies declare
                Chapter 7 bankruptcy annually with most of the firms being small.
                      Chapter 11 bankruptcy allows organizations to retrench, reorganize, and come back after
                filing a petition for protection. About 40 large U.S. retail companies declared bankruptcy in both
                2017 and 2018, up from 18 in 2016. Firms declaring bankruptcy in 2017 included RadioShack,
                Payless Shoes, The Limited, HHGregg, Rue 21, Gander Mountain, and Toys R Us. Other retail com-
                panies closing stores rapidly and possibly heading for bankruptcy include Gymboree, Bebe, Crocs,
                Gamestop, Sears/Kmart, J. C. Penney, Michael Kors, Staples, Macy’s, and Chico’s. A key problem
                for retail firms is shoppers’ discount addiction spurred by Amazon’s prowess and also smartphone-
                shopping tools and apps prompting never-ending price-cutting, price matching, and price wars. The
                dramatic shift to online purchasing has also severely curtailed the need for brick-and-mortar stores
                of all kinds.
                      Three guidelines reveal when retrenchment may be an especially effective strategy to pursue
                follow:15
                   1. An organization is plagued by inefficiency, low profitability, poor employee morale, and
                      pressure from stockholders to improve performance.
                   2. An organization has failed to capitalize on external opportunities, minimize external
                      threats, take advantage of internal strengths, and overcome internal weaknesses over time;
                      that is, when the organization’s strategic managers have failed (and possibly will be re-
                      placed by more competent individuals).
                   3. An organization has grown so large so quickly that major internal reorganization is
                      needed.


               Divestiture
               Selling a division or part of an organization is called divestiture. It is often used to raise
               capital for further strategic acquisitions or investments. Divestiture can be part of an overall
               retrenchment strategy to rid an organization of businesses that are unprofitable, that require
               too much capital, or that do not fit well with the firm’s other activities. Divestiture has also
               become a popular strategy for firms to refocus on their core businesses and become less
               diversified.
                    Volkswagen AG recently divested upward of 20 percent of the company’s assets that are
               not part of the firm’s core business including the potential sale of Ducati, the motorcycle brand.
               Commonwealth Bank of Australia recently divested all of its life insurance businesses in Australia
               and New Zealand totaling more than $3 billion, partly in response to pressure from regulators in

                                  the countries. Nestlé SA recently divested its U.S. chocolate segment to the Italian firm Ferrero
                                  International SA for $2.8 billion, making the family-owned Ferrero company the third-largest
                                  chocolate seller in the United States.
                                       A form of divestiture occurs when a corporation splits into two or more parts. Most
                                  often, divested segments become separate, publicly traded companies. Many large conglom-
                                  erate firms are employing this strategy. Sometimes this strategy is a prelude to the firm
                                  selling the separated part(s) to a rival firm. Corporations annually split off about $2 trillion
                                  worth of subsidiaries. Part of the reason for splitting diversified firms is that the homogenous
                                  parts are generally much more attractive to potential buyers. Most times, the acquiring firms
                                  desire to promote homogeneity to complement their own operations, rather than heteroge-
                                  neity, and are willing to pay for homogeneity. For example, Nacco Industries is divesting
                                  its Hamilton Beach Brands appliances and a kitchen-accessory store chain in an effort to
                                  refocus on its core coal and mining businesses. Nacco’s revenues are about $900 million
                                  annually with Hamilton Beach bringing in about $605 million and Kitchen Collection about
                                  $144 million. Similarly, Britain’s GKN PLC in 2018 split into two companies, separating its
                                  aerospace and automotive businesses. Based in Redditch, England, GKN is one of Britain’s
                                  oldest companies (250 years) and today has about 58,000 employees.
                                       Another example is the German company Daimler AG in 2018 consolidating its five busi-
                                  ness divisions into three separately registered, wholly-owned subsidiary companies. Analysts
                                  expect the Daimler restructuring is a prelude for Daimler divesting (spinning off) the three seg-
                                  ments into separate publicly listed companies: (1) Mercedes-Benz cars and vans, (2) Daimler
                                  trucks and buses, and (3) Daimler Financial Services. Pfizer Inc. and Honeywell International
                                  Inc. recently divested several of their major business units, spinning them off into separate pub-
                                  licly listed companies.
                                       Here are some guidelines for when divestiture may be an especially effective strategy to pursue:16
                                   1. An organization has pursued a retrenchment strategy and failed to accomplish needed
                                      improvements.
                                   2. A division is responsible for an organization’s overall poor performance.
                                   3. A division is a misfit with the rest of an organization; this can result from radically differ-
                                      ent markets, customers, managers, employees, values, or needs.
                                   4. A large amount of cash is needed quickly and cannot be obtained reasonably from other
                                      sources.
                                   5. Government antitrust action threatens an organization.

                                  Liquidation
                                  Selling all of a company’s assets, in parts, for their tangible worth is called liquidation.
                                  Liquidation is a recognition of defeat and consequently can be an emotionally difficult strat-
                                  egy. However, it may be better to cease operating than to continue losing large sums of money
                                  Chapter 7 ­bankruptcy is a liquidation procedure used only when a corporation sees no hope of
                                  being able to operate successfully or to obtain the necessary creditor agreement. All the organi-
                                  zation’s assets are sold in parts for their tangible worth. Several hundred thousand companies
                                  declare Chapter 7 bankruptcy annually with most of the firms being small.
                                        The legendary, world famous, Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey circus liquidated in
                                  2017 after 146 years in business because of “declining tickets sales and high operating costs.”
                                  The final circus performances were in Providence, Rhode Island, on May 7 and Uniondale,
                                  New York, on May 21, 2017. In May 2016, the circus had previously retired its elephant act,
                                  years after a suit by activists. The animal rights group PETA says “we herald the end of what
                                  has been the saddest show on earth for wild animals, and ask all other animal circuses to f­ ollow
                                  suit, as this is a sign of changing times.” PETA President Ingrid Newkirk says “our protests
                                  have awoken the world to the plight of animals in captivity.” The Ringling Bros. and Barnum &
                                  Bailey circus went by the slogan: “The greatest show on earth,” a catchphrase so famous it was
                                  employed for the title of the 1952 Cecil B. DeMille best picture Oscar-winning film starring
                                  Charlton Heston and Betty Hutton. For more than 100 years, schools would close in towns and
                                  cities when Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey came to town; those days are long gone.

                    The American iconic toy store chain Toys “R” Us Inc. in 2018 liquidated, selling or clos-
               ing all its 885 U.S. stores deleting about 33,000 jobs. The company is likely to liquidate also in
               France, Spain, Poland, and Australia. The company hopes to sell its operation in Canada, Central
               Europe, and Asia.
                    Two guidelines reveal when liquidation may be an especially effective strategy to pursue:17
                   1. An organization has pursued both a retrenchment strategy and a divestiture strategy, and
                      neither has been successful.
                   2. The stockholders of a firm can minimize their losses by selling the organization’s assets.

               Whenever a customer buys a product it is because that consumer feels the “value” to be derived
               from that product in terms of price paid versus benefits received is worthwhile. However, the
               ultimate price paid by a consumer for a product is determined from scores of activities that went
               into producing that product, from raw materials to suppliers, to production processes, to distribu-
               tors, etc. This collection of activities that leads to the ultimate price of a product is commonly
               referred to as a firm’s value chain.18 Firm’s seek competitive advantages anywhere they can up
               and down their value chain, to ultimately provide some product at some price and some level of
               quality that consumers will perceive to be of sufficient value to warrant the purchase. The value
               chain concept, as illustrated in Figure 5-3, is important in strategic management.
                    Value chain analysis (VCA) can be defined as the process whereby a firm determines the
               value (price minus cost) of each and all activities that went into producing and marketing a prod-
               uct, from purchasing raw materials to manufacturing, distributing, and marketing those products.
               VCA is an excellent way to identify both external opportunities/threats and internal strengths/
               weaknesses of a firm. Companies strive to gain competitive advantages wherever possible up and
               down their value chain, because such “value activities” are not easily duplicated or imitable by
               rival firms. In contrast, just lowering the price of an end product or hiring a celebrity to promote
               an end product is easily imitable; such actions do not represent a sustainable competitive advan-
               tage. In other words, at every step along a firm’s value chain, the firm strives to create value (price

                                     will buy the product at some price to obtain the perceived value.
                                           Substantial judgment may be required in performing a VCA because different items
                                     along the value chain may impact other items positively or negatively, at times creat-

                                     price differences among rival firms can have their origins in activities performed by sup-
           Transportation            pliers, distributors, creditors, or even shareholders.
           Truck drivers                   The initial step in implementing VCA is to divide a firm’s operations into specific
           Truck maintenance         activities or business processes. Then the analyst attempts to attach a cost of each discrete
           Component parts           activity versus the price to be paid; the costs could be in terms of both time and money.
           Inspection                Finally, the analyst converts the “value data” into information by looking for competitive
           Storing                   oppotunities/threats and/or strengths/weaknesses that may yield competitive advantage
           Warehouse                 or disadvantage. Conducting a VCA is supportive of the research-based view’s examina-
    Production Costs                 tion of a firm’s assets and capabilities as sources of distinctive competence.
           Inventory system                When a major competitor or new market entrant offers products or services at low
           Receiving                 prices, this may be because that firm has substantially lower value chain costs or perhaps

           Cost accounting                 A value chain is illustrated in Figure 5-4. There can be more than a hundred particu-

           Shipping                  advantage or disadvantage for the firm. The combined costs of all the various activities
           Budgeting                 in a company’s value chain define the firm’s cost of doing business. Firms should deter-

                                           All firms should use VCA to develop and nurture a core competence and convert
           Publicity
                                     this competence into a distinctive competence. A core competence is any element of a
           Promotion                 firm's value chain that performs especially well (yields high value). When a core compe-
           Advertising               tence evolves into a major competitive advantage, then it is called a distinctive compe-
           Transportation            tence. Figure 5-5 illustrates this process.
           Food and lodging                More and more companies are using VCA to gain and sustain competitive advantage
    Customer Service Costs           by becoming especially efficient and effective along various parts of the value chain. For
           Postage                   example, Walmart has built powerful value advantages by focusing on exceptionally tight
           Phone                     inventory control and volume purchasing of products. In contrast, computer companies
           Internet                  compete aggressively along the distribution end of the value chain. Price competitive-
           Warranty                  ness is a key component of competitiveness for both mass retailers and computer firms.
    Management Costs                       To gain and sustain competitive advantage, a firm must create value for a product or
           Human resources
                                     service that exceeds the value offered by rivals.19 This is commonly done in one of two
           Administration
                                     ways: (1) operating at the lowest cost, or (2) commanding a premium price. A few firms
           Employee benefits
                                     try to do both simultaneously. The bottom line, however, is that a business needs to be

           Managers
                                     better than rivals on many points along its value chain because these points likely cannot
           Employees                 be easily copied, thus they are sustainable. Rival firms ask, “How do they do it?” The
           Finance and legal         answer for many successful firms is “through effective value chain analysis.”
                                           VCA focuses on the quality differences in activities among rival firms. Not all firms
                                     in a given industry will place equal weights on various value chain items. For exam-

               as consumers feel they are getting value for the price paid for the product or service and each
               firm can have its own competitive advantage in the watch industry. Even though the weights on
               various value chain items can differ within the same industry, firms should strive to understand
               not only their own value chain operations, but also those of the industry, competitors, suppliers,
               and distributors.
                    VCA is a tool used to examine each step along the path of creating value from upstream
               operations such as suppliers all the way to downstream operations of delivering the product to
               customers. One of the main benefits of VCA is that each activity from start to finish has a value
               element that can be improved upon. Pay careful attention to areas along the value chain that are
               likely to lead to higher quality or lower cost. Also, be mindful it is generally more advantageous
               to choose a path of being different than a rival on select value chain activities than simply trying
               to compete with them on every item. The jewelry firms Tiffany and Blue Nile are great examples
               of firms that have chosen to be different in the way they create value for customers.

               Benchmarking
               Benchmarking is another analytical tool used to determine whether a firm’s value chain is
               competitive compared to those of rivals and thus conducive to winning in the marketplace.
               Benchmarking entails examination of value chain activities across an industry to determine
               “best practices” among competing firms; firms engage in benchmarking for the purpose of du-
               plicating or improving on those best practices. Similar to VCA, benchmarking is an analyti-
               cal tool used to identify key external opportunities/threats and internal strengths/weaknesses.
               Benchmarking enables a firm to take action to improve its competitiveness by identifying (and
               improving on) value chain activities where rival firms have comparative advantages in cost, ser-
               vice, reputation, or operation.
                    A challenging part of benchmarking can be gaining access to other firms’ VCAs with asso-
               ciated costs. Typical sources of benchmarking information, however, include published reports,
               trade publications, suppliers, distributors, customers, partners, creditors, shareholders, lobbyists,
               and willing rival firms. Some rival firms share benchmarking data. However, the International
               Benchmarking Clearinghouse provides guidelines to help ensure that restraint of trade, price fixing,
               bid rigging, bribery, and other improper business conduct do not arise between participating firms.
                    Although benchmarking is useful, strategists should be mindful of their firm’s unique po-
               sition and how their firm differs from rivals when selecting which factors along a value chain
               to benchmark. Never benchmark variable after variable without discretion. For example, Five
               Guys who specialize in burgers made to order with quality ingredients should not benchmark
               McDonald’s “service time” component, just as McDonald’s should not benchmark Five Guys
               “quality” component. Five Guys benchmarking and attempting to compete with McDonald’s
               on service time would be dysfunctional to Five Guys unique strategy and position of offering
               higher quality burgers; erroneous benchmarking could lead a firm away from what made the firm
               successful. This is not to say “improving on service time” is not important; it is just that Five
               Guys should not sacrifice “made to order burgers” for “premade burgers” simply to benchmark
               McDonald’s service-time component. Recall that uniqueness is important in strategic manage-
               ment, so use benchmarking wisely.

                                  LO 5.8   Michael Porter’s Two Generic Strategies
                                           According to Michael Porter, strategies allow organizations to gain competitive advantage
                                           from two different bases: cost leadership and differentiation. Porter calls these bases generic
                                           strategies because generally firms should be mindful it is often best to develop product lines
                                           that compete on cost or compete on unique value; it is difficult to compete on both simulta-
                                           neously. Cost leadership emphasizes producing standardized products or services at a low
                                           per-unit cost for consumers who are price sensitive. Differentiation is a strategy aimed at
                                           producing products and services considered unique to the industry and directed at consumers
                                           who are relatively price insensitive. Unlike with cost leadership where a firm examines how to
                                           reduce costs all along its value chain, with differentiation the firm looks to maximize value all
                                           along its value chain.

                                           Cost Leadership
                                           As indicated in Table 5-5, there are two types of cost leadership strategies. Type 1 is a broad low-
                                           cost strategy that offers products or services to a wide range of customers at one of the lowest
                                           prices available on the market. Type 2 is a narrow or focused low-cost strategy that offers prod-
                                           ucts or services to a small range of customers at one of the lowest prices on the market. A cost
                                           leadership strategy aims to offer customers a range of products or services at the lowest price
                                           available compared to a rival’s products with similar attributes.
                                                Walmart could serve as an example firm pursuing a Type 1 cost leadership strategy because the
                                           company serves a broad range of market segments with varied socioeconomic backgrounds. Dollar
                                           General would serve as an example of Type 2 focusing mostly on rural areas, limited product lines,
                                           less décor devoted to the stores, and less service. Both Type 1 and Type 2 strategies target a large
                                           market. This is an important distinction of any cost leadership market; in order to achieve economies
                                           of scale, there must be large market potential. Both Walmart and Dollar General met the large mar-
                                           ket potential criteria, even though Dollar General has a significantly more focused target customer
                                           base. Amazon is potentially another example of Type 1 cost leadership; Jiffy Lube, Little Caesars
                                           Pizza, and Spirit Airlines are all examples of successful Type 2 cost-leadership strategies, as well
                                           as examples of firms “saying no and accepting trade-offs” as a part of their cost leadership strategy.
                                                Striving to be the low-cost producer in an industry can be especially effective when the
                                           market is composed of many price-sensitive buyers, when there are few ways to achieve prod-
                                           uct differentiation, when buyers do not care much about differences from brand to brand, or
                                           when there are a large number of buyers with significant bargaining power. The basic idea
                                           is to underprice competitors and thereby gain market share and sales, entirely driving some
                                           competitors out of the market. Companies employing a cost-leadership strategy must achieve
                                           their competitive advantage in ways that are difficult for competitors to copy or match. If ri-
                                           vals find it relatively easy or inexpensive to imitate the leader’s cost-leadership methods, the
                                           leaders’ advantage will not last long enough to yield a valuable edge in the marketplace. In
                                           other words, firms try to gain competitive advantages all along their value chain, so the firm
                                           can ultimately provide some product at some price low enough to yield compelling value to
                                           customers.
                                                For a resource to be valuable, it must be either rare, hard to imitate, or not easily substitutable.
                                           To employ a cost-leadership strategy successfully, a firm must ensure that its total costs across
                                           its overall value chain are lower than competitors’ total costs. A key way to first ensure the firm
                                           is maintaining its cost-leadership competitive advantage is to routinely examine every level of its
                                           value chain relative to rival firms for areas of possible cost savings. A successful ­cost-leadership

               strategy usually permeates the entire firm, as evidenced by high efficiency, low overhead, limited
               perks, intolerance of waste, intensive screening of budget requests, wide spans of control, rewards
               linked to cost containment, and broad employee participation in cost control efforts.
                    Some risks of pursuing cost leadership are that competitors may imitate the strategy, thus driv-
               ing overall industry profits down; technological breakthroughs in the industry may make the strategy
               ineffective; or buyer interest may swing to other differentiating features besides price; simply cutting
               retail prices will not yield a cost leadership position since such actions are easily copied and will
               erode margins.


               Differentiation
               There are two levels of a successful differentiation strategy, Type 3 having a wide target market
               and Type 4 having a narrow target market, as revealed in Table 5-5. Under differentiation strat-
               egies, firms are not as reliant on economies of scale, so targeting a small group of customers
               can be advantageous if they are willing to pay a premium for the products or services offered.
               A differentiation strategy should be pursued only after a careful study of buyers’ needs and
               preferences has determined the feasibility of incorporating one or more differentiating features
               into a unique product that showcases the desired attributes. A successful differentiation strategy
               allows a firm to charge a higher price for its product and to gain customer loyalty because con-
               sumers may become strongly attached to the differentiating features, such as superior service,
               spare parts availability, engineering design, product performance, useful life, gas mileage, or
               ease of use.
                     Examples of firms employing Type 3-wide differentiation strategies would include Monster
               Beverage, Apple, and BMW; these firms employ a strategy that adds perceived value over Coca-
               Cola, an LG smartphone, or a Ford Escort at significantly higher prices than their counterparts.
               All three also target a wider audience than brands like Louis Vuitton, Rolex, or Maserati which
               operate under a Type 4 strategy. A firm does not have to offer extremely expensive products to
               use a Type 4 strategy, but generally this is the case because creating value at every step of the
               value chain is expensive and with limited buyers reducing economies of scale prices tend to be
               expensive.
                     Generally, environments favorable to differentiation are those where buyers have many dif-
               ferent tastes or application needs. For example, the quality and type of food desired by consum-
               ers varies greatly, leading to many different types of restaurants. When technology is changing
               rapidly, firms can release new products and often have customers “trained” to purchase the lat-
               est and greatest. Apple enjoys being differentiated through its own IOS software. All the other
               leading phone manufacturers use Android, Windows, or some other operating system created by
               different firms. Whenever customers view products as commodities, there is a need for differen-
               tiation; even “commodities” such as milk or eggs can often be differentiated through marketing,
               attractive packaging, and other tactics leading to prices often twice as high as competitors.
                     Differentiation does not guarantee competitive advantage, especially if standard products
               sufficiently meet customer needs or if rapid imitation by competitors is possible. Products pro-
               tected by barriers which prevent quick copying by competitors are best. Successful differentia-
               tion can mean greater product flexibility, greater compatibility, lower costs, improved service,
               less maintenance, greater convenience, or more features. Product development is an example of
               a strategy that offers the advantages of differentiation.
                     A risk of pursuing a differentiation strategy is that the unique product may not be valued
               highly enough by customers to justify the higher price. When this happens, a cost-leadership strat-
               egy will easily defeat a differentiation strategy. Another risk of pursuing a differentiation strategy
               is that competitors may quickly develop ways to copy the differentiating features. Thus, firms must
               find durable sources of uniqueness that cannot be imitated quickly or inexpensively by rival firms.
                     Common organizational requirements for a successful differentiation strategy include strong
               coordination among the R&D and marketing functions and substantial amenities to attract sci-
               entists and creative people. Firms can pursue a differentiation strategy based on many different
               competitive aspects. Differentiation opportunities exist or can potentially be developed anywhere
               along the firm’s value chain, including supply chain activities, product R&D activities, produc-
               tion and technological activities, manufacturing activities, human resource management activi-
               ties, distribution activities, or marketing activities.

                                               The most effective differentiation bases are those that are difficult or expensive for rivals to
                                           duplicate. Competitors are continually trying to imitate, duplicate, and outperform rivals along
                                           any differentiation variable that yields competitive advantage. Firms must be careful when em-

                                           ceived value of the differentiated offering exceeds its price.20

                                  LO 5.9   Means for Achieving Strategies
                                           Companies are under continual pressure from stockholders to maintain top line (revenues) and
                                           bottom line (net income) growth (usually 4+ percent) and pay higher dividends. To accomplish
                                           this end, firms are often faced with a BUILD, BORROW, or BUY decision. Building is growing
                                           internally (organically), borrowing is growing externally using means such as partnerships, joint
                                           ventures, and alliances; finally, buying includes mergers and acquisitions. Let’s look at build,
                                           borrow, or buy options a bit closer.

                                           BUILD from Within to Grow
                                           When firms build from within, sometimes called organic growth, as a means for achieving strat-
                                           egies, strategists must consider how well current internal resources match the capabilities needed
                                           to grow (4+ percent). Building from within can include new training programs, hiring new em-
                                           ployees, building (instead of buying rival’s) stores, or developing a “blue ocean strategy.” A blue
                                           ocean strategy aims to target a new market where competition is not yet present, thus creating
                                           a “blue ocean” as opposed to a red ocean where many firms are competing often on price, and
                                           the gains of one firm are often at the expense of another. Blue ocean strategy is similar to being
                                           a first mover seeking market space not yet occupied by rivals.
                                                Kim and Mauborgne’s research on blue oceans revealed that existing line extensions ac-
                                           count for 86 percent of new products created; only 14 percent of new ventures are targeted at
                                           new markets or industries.21 Blue ocean thinking in developing news markets and products
                                           can provide benefits far greater than competing in traditional markets. Apple’s development
                                           of the PC and smartphone were blue ocean examples where customers did not even know
                                           they desired the products before they were brought to market by Apple. However, the blue
                                           ocean environment did not last long for Apple on either product because competitors en-
                                           tered quickly, forcing Apple to operate under what Porter would classify as a differentiation
                                           strategy.
                                                Netflix, Southwest, eBay, and Amazon, like Apple, were all derived partly from blue
                                           ocean thinking. These examples are of blue oceans where there was no defined industry or
                                           market for the products previously, but according to Kim and Mauborgne, blue oceans can
                                           arise from already established industries as well. It is likely blue oceans within current indus-
                                           tries will not be as sustainable and may even erode a firm’s mission, moving it away from its
                                           core competencies. Extra care should be taken when considering blue ocean thinking while
                                           operating within an already established industry. However, a firm does not have to have a blue
                                           ocean to build.

                                           BORROW from Others to Grow
                                           Firms tend to “borrow” capabilities through joint ventures or strategic alliances when the (1)
                                           firm does not believe it can develop the necessary resources internally, or (2) the costs and risks
                                           of merging are too high. Joint venture occurs when two or more companies form a temporary
                                           partnership or consortium for the purpose of capitalizing on some opportunity and have shared
                                           equity ownership in the new entity. Joint ventures are being used increasingly because they allow
                                           companies to improve communications and networking, to globalize operations, and to minimize
                                           risk. They are formed when a given opportunity is too complex, uneconomical, or risky for a
                                           single firm to pursue alone, or when an endeavor requires a broader range of competencies and
                                           know-how than any one firm possesses. Joint ventures are less common than alliances but more
                                           common than mergers or acquisitions.
                                                Qualcomm formed a joint venture with China’s Guizhou province to produce server
                                           chips in China. The new company is owned 55 percent by the Chinese province and 45 per-
                                           cent by Qualcomm. Coca-Cola and Nestlé recently agreed to dissolve their tea joint venture

               named Beverage Partners Worldwide. Kathryn Rudie Harrigan summarizes the trend toward
               increased joint venturing: “In today’s global business environment of scarce resources, rapid
               rates of technological change, and rising capital requirements, the important question is no
               longer ‘Shall we form a joint venture?’ Now the question is ‘Which joint ventures and co-
               operative arrangements are most appropriate for our needs and expectations?’ followed by
               ‘How do we manage these ventures most effectively?’ ”22 Four common reasons joint ventures
               struggle are:
                   1. Managers who must collaborate daily in operating the venture are not involved in forming
                      or shaping the venture.
                   2. The venture may benefit the partnering companies but may not benefit customers, who
                      then complain about poorer service or criticize the companies in other ways.
                   3. The venture may not be supported equally by both partners. If supported unequally, prob-
                      lems arise.
                   4. The venture may begin to compete more with one of the partners than the other.23
                    Six guidelines for when a joint venture may be an especially effective means for pursuing
               strategies are:24
                   1. A privately owned firm forms a joint venture with a publicly owned organization. The
                      advantages to being privately held, such as closed ownership, and the advantages of being
                      publicly held, such as access to stock issuances as a source of capital, can sometimes be
                      synergistically combined in a joint venture.
                   2. A domestic firm forms a joint venture with a foreign company. A joint venture can provide
                      a domestic firm with the opportunity for obtaining local management in a foreign country,
                      thereby reducing risks such as expropriation and harassment by host country officials.
                   3. The distinct competencies of two or more firms complement each other especially well.
                   4. A particular project is potentially profitable but requires overwhelming resources and risks.
                   5. Two or more smaller firms have trouble competing with a large firm.
                   6. There is a need to quickly introduce a new technology.
                    Cooperation among competitors is a popular borrow strategy. Microsoft and business-­
               software vendor SAP SE recently formed an alliance to challenge Amazon.com’s dominance
               in the $23 billion annual market for web-based, on-demand computing resources. As part of the
               deal, SAP is now using Microsoft’s Azure cloud-computing services. The Microsoft-SAP deal
               follows a similar deal whereby Microsoft and Adobe Systems agreed to cross promote each
               other’s products.
                    Cooperation among competitors is becoming more common. For collaboration to suc-
               ceed, both firms must contribute something distinctive, such as technology, distribution, basic
               research, or manufacturing capacity. But a major risk is that unintended transfers of important
               skills or technology may occur at organizational levels below where the deal was signed.25
               Information not covered in the formal agreement often gets traded in the day-to-day interactions
               and dealings of engineers, marketers, and product developers. Firms often give away too much
               information to rival firms when operating under cooperative agreements! Tighter formal agree-
               ments are needed.
                    Perhaps the best example of rival firms in an industry forming alliances to compete
               against each other is the airline industry. Today, there are three major alliances: Star,
               SkyTeam, and Oneworld. Joint ventures and cooperative arrangements among competitors
               demand a certain amount of trust if companies are to combat paranoia about whether one
               firm will injure the other. Increasing numbers of domestic firms are joining forces with
               competitive foreign firms to reap mutual benefits. Kathryn Harrigan at Columbia University
               contends, “Within a decade, most companies will be members of teams that compete against
               each other.”
                    Often, U.S. companies enter alliances primarily to reduce costs and risks of entering new
               businesses or markets. In contrast, learning from the partner is a major reason why Asian
               and European firms enter into cooperative agreements. U.S. firms, too, should place learn-
               ing high on the list of reasons to be cooperative with competitors. Companies in the United
               States often form alliances with firms in Asia to gain an understanding of their manufacturing

                                           excellence, but manufacturing competence is not easily transferable. Manufacturing excel-
                                           lence is a complex system that includes employee training and involvement, integration with
                                           suppliers, statistical process controls, value engineering, and design. In contrast, U.S. know-
                                           how in technology and related areas can be imitated more easily. Therefore, U.S. firms need
                                           to be careful not to give away more intelligence than they receive in cooperative agreements
                                           with rival Asian firms.

                                           BUY Others to Grow
                                           Merger and acquisition refers to firms buying others to grow. A merger occurs when two orga-
                                           nizations of about equal size unite to form one enterprise. An acquisition occurs when a large
                                           organization purchases (acquires) a smaller firm or vice versa. If a merger or acquisition is not
                                           desired by both parties, it is called a hostile takeover, as opposed to a friendly merger. Most
                                           mergers are friendly, but the number of hostile takeovers is on the rise. A hostile takeover is
                                           not unethical as long as it is conducted in a civil and legal manner. Sometimes shareholders are
                                           skeptical, though, given that current research reveals CEOs to be less ethical today, as indicated
                                           in Ethics Capsule 5.
                                                Not all mergers are effective and successful. For example, soon after Halliburton acquired
                                           Baker Hughes, Halliburton’s stock price declined 11 percent. So, a merger between two firms
                                           can yield great benefits, but the price and reasoning must be right. More than 10,000 mergers
                                           transpire annually in the United States, with same-industry combinations predominating. A gen-
                                           eral market consolidation is occurring in most industries.
                                                Six reasons why many mergers and acquisitions fail are provided in Table 5-6. Table 5-7
                                           presents the potential benefits of merging with or acquiring another firm.
                                                A leveraged buyout (LBO) occurs when a firm’s shareholders are bought (hence buyout)
                                           by the company’s management and other private investors using borrowed funds (hence lever-
                                           age). Besides trying to avoid a hostile takeover, other reasons for initiating an LBO include
                                           instances when a particular division(s) lacks fit with an overall corporate strategy, as well as
                                           when selling a division could raise needed cash. An LBO converts a public firm into a private
                                           company.
                                                Another popular way for firms to grow occurs whenever a private-equity (PE) firm acquires
                                           and takes private some target firm. For example, Ruby Tuesday was taken private in late 2017
                                           when the private-equity firm NRD Capital Management bought the casual-dining restaurant

       Are CEOs Less Ethical Today Than in the Past?

                    The intent of virtually all PE acquisitions is to buy firms at a low price and sell them later at
               a high price, which is arguably just good business. Buffalo Wild Wings (BWW) recently received
               a $2.3-billion takeover bid from the PE firm Roark Capital Group. Roark’s offer of $151 per
               share was a premium of at least 28 percent over BWW’s stock price at the time. Roark eventually
               bought BWW for $157 per share, representing a premium of 7.2 percent (low because BWW
               stock price had increased).
                    PE firms are rapidly acquiring opioid-addiction clinics and treatment centers, such as
               Kohlberg & Co.’s recent $180 million acquisition of the Meadows in Wickenburg, Arizona. U.S.
               drug- and alcohol-addiction clinics generate over $10 billion in revenue annually through more
               than 3,000 facilities that are quickly growing.


               First-Mover Advantages                                                                                   LO 5.10
               First-mover advantages refer to the benefits a firm may achieve by entering a new market
               or developing a new product or service prior to rival firms. As indicated in Table 5-8, some
               advantages of being a first mover include securing access to rare resources, gaining new
               knowledge of key factors and issues, and carving out market share and a position that is easy
               to defend and costly for rival firms to overtake. First-mover advantages are analogous to
               taking the high ground first, which puts one in an excellent strategic position to launch ag-
               gressive campaigns and to defend territory. Being the first mover can be an excellent strategy
               when such actions (1) build a firm’s image and reputation with buyers; (2) produce cost ad-
               vantages over rivals in terms of new technologies, new components, new distribution chan-
               nels; (3) create strongly loyal customers; and (4) make imitation or duplication by a rival
               difficult or unlikely.

                                        TABLE 5-8 Six Benefits of a Firm Being the First Mover

                                            1. Secure access and commitments to rare resources.
                                            2. Gain new knowledge of critical success factors and issues.
                                            3. Gain market share and position in the best locations.
                                            4. Establish and secure long-term relationships with customers, suppliers, distributors, and
                                               investors.
                                            5. Gain customer loyalty and commitments.
                                            6. Gain patent protection early.


                                              One of the keys in deciding to be a first mover is how quickly will a new technology, prod-
                                        uct, or service catch-on with a target market. Quicker adoption by the bulk of the customer base
                                        enhances the incentive to be a first mover. Quick adoption may especially be likely in industries
                                        such as pharmaceuticals where patent protection can virtually lock out anyone other than the first
                                        mover.
                                              To sustain the competitive advantage gained by being the first mover, a firm needs to be a
                                        fast learner. There are, however, risks associated with being the first mover, such as unantici-
                                        pated problems and costs that occur from being the first firm doing business in the new market.
                                        Therefore, being a slow mover (also called fast follower or late mover) can be effective when a
                                        firm can easily copy or imitate the lead firm’s products or services, especially when initial costs
                                        are high. If technology is advancing rapidly, slow movers can often leapfrog a first-mover’s prod-
                                        ucts with improved second-generation products, so being a late mover has potential advantages.
                                              In some industries, being a fast follower may be the better strategy, such as in the elec-
                                        tric car business where most customers have not quickly adopted the new technology, due to
                                        high switching costs, lack of infrastructure of charging stations, and uneasiness. Apple was a
                                        first mover in the PC market, but initially struggled as the market was not ready to adopt PCs
                                        widespread. However, in iPods and iPhones, Apple was a first mover and continues to enjoy
                                        many benefits of entering the market first and profiting from high-switching costs that customers
                                        would incur by switching from Apple’s unique operating system.

                              LO 5.11   Strategic Management in Nonprofit and Small Firms
                                        Nonprofit organizations are similar to for-profit companies in virtually evey respect except for two
                                        major differences: (1) Nonprofits do not pay taxes, and (2) nonprofits do not have shareholders to
                                        provide capital. Nonprofits have employees, customers, creditors, suppliers, and distributors as well
                                        as financial budgets, income statements, balance sheets, cash flow statements, and so on. Nonprofit
                                        organizations embrace strategic planning as much as for-profit firms, and perhaps even more. Both
                                        nonprofit and for-profit organizations have competitors that want to put them out of business.
                                             The strategic-management process is being used effectively by countless nonprofit and govern-
                                        mental organizations, such as the Girl Scouts, Boy Scouts, the Red Cross, chambers of commerce,
                                        educational institutions, medical institutions, public utilities, libraries, government agencies, zoos,
                                        cities, and churches. Many nonprofit and governmental organizations outperform private firms
                                        and corporations on innovativeness, motivation, productivity, and strategic management.
                                             Compared to for-profit firms, nonprofit and governmental organizations may be totally
                                        dependent on outside financing. Especially for these organizations, strategic management pro-
                                        vides an excellent vehicle for developing and justifying requests for needed financial support.
                                        Nonprofits and governmental organizations owe it to their constituencies to garner and use mon-
                                        ies wisely; that requires excellent strategy formulation, implementation, and evaluation.

                                        Educational Institutions
                                        Accrediting bodies that audit colleges and universities (such as SACS and AACSB) require con-
                                        tinuous strategic planning. The Institute of International Education reported in late 2017 that
                                        the number of international new students attending U.S. universities declined by 7 percent in
                                        the fall of 2017, the largest drop in a few years. Some MBA programs across the United States
                                        are closing because of falling enrollments, including at the University of Iowa, Wake Forest
                                        University, Virginia Tech, Simmons College, and possibly even at the University of Wisconsin.

               College enrollments in general are declining. State and federal support/monies given to institu-
               tions of higher learning in the United States is dropping more than 5 percent annually. All these
               factors make strategic planning essential for institutions of higher learning.
                    Population shifts nationally from the Northeast and Midwest to the Southeast and West are an-
               other threat. To cope with severe external threats, educational institutions are more frequently using
               strategic-management concepts, tools, and techniques. Richard Cyert, former president of Carnegie
               Mellon University, said, “I believe we do a far better job of strategic management than any company
               I know.” Because MBA programs are struggling, universities are selling MBA courses piecemeal and
               offering various types of business certifications comprised of one to three online courses. For exam-
               ple, Wharton offers a professional certificate in digital marketing comprised of several $600 courses,
               as compared to their 900 MBA students who pay about $250,000 for their degrees.26 Harvard
               Business School charges up to $1,500 for online 8-week classes like “Becoming a Better Manager.”
                    Ivy League schools in the Northeast are recruiting more heavily in the Southeast and West.
               This trend represents a significant change in the competitive climate for attracting the best high
               school graduates each year. Online degrees are a threat to traditional colleges and universities. “You
               can put the kids to bed and go to law school,” says Andrew Rosen, chief operating officer of Kaplan
               Education Centers, a subsidiary of the Washington Post Company. Reduced state and federal fund-
               ing for higher education has resulted in more aggressive fundraising by colleges and universities.

               Governmental Agencies and Departments
               Federal, state, county, and municipal agencies and departments, such as police departments, cham-
               bers of commerce, forestry associations, and health departments, are responsible for formulating,
               implementing, and evaluating strategies that use taxpayers’ dollars in the most cost-effective way
               to provide services and programs. Strategic-management concepts are generally required and thus
               widely used to enable governmental organizations to be more effective and efficient.
                    Strategists in governmental organizations operate with less strategic autonomy than their
               counterparts in private firms. Public enterprises generally cannot diversify into unrelated busi-
               nesses or merge with other firms. Governmental strategists usually enjoy little freedom in alter-
               ing the organization’s mission or redirecting objectives. Legislators and politicians often have
               direct or indirect control over major decisions and resources. Strategic issues get discussed and
               debated in the media and legislatures. Issues become politicized, resulting in fewer strategic
               choice alternatives. However, government agencies and departments are finding that their em-
               ployees get excited about the opportunity to participate in the strategic-management process and
               thereby have an effect on the organization’s core value, vision, mission, objectives, strategies,
               and policies. In addition, government agencies are using a strategic-management approach to
               develop and substantiate formal requests for additional funding.

               Small Firms
               “Becoming your own boss” is a dream for millions of people and a reality for millions more.
               Almost everyone wants to own a business—from teens and college students, who are signing
               up for entrepreneurial courses in record numbers, to those older than age 65, who are forming
               more companies every year. However, the percentage of people younger than age 30 who own
               private businesses has reached a 24-year low in the United States, to about 3.6 percent, down
               from 10.6 percent in 1989. The stereotype that 20-somethings are entrepreneurial risk-takers
               is simply false, as millions of young adults struggle in underpaid jobs to maintain their own
               household, rather than living with their parents. Reasons for the decline vary, but reduced bank
               lending for small business startups, more indebtedness among young people, and increasing
               numbers of competitors because of the Internet, all contribute to a more risk-averse, younger-
               than-30 age group.
                     The strategic-management process is just as vital for small companies as it is for large firms.
               From their inception, all organizations have a strategy, even if the strategy just evolves from day-
               to-day operations. Even if conducted informally or by a single owner or entrepreneur, the strategic-
               management process can significantly enhance small firms’ growth and prosperity. However, a lack
               of strategic-management knowledge is a serious obstacle for many small business owners, as is a lack
               of sufficient capital to exploit external opportunities and a day-to-day cognitive frame of reference.

        IMPLICATIONS FOR STRATEGISTS
       Figure 5-6 reveals that to gain and sustain competitive advantages,       exists among teams such as Auburn, Alabama, Ohio State, Florida
       firms must collect, analyze, and prioritize large amounts of informa-     State, Kansas State, Oregon, Arizona State, Michigan State, and
       tion to make excellent decisions. A “strategic plan” is very much         Michigan, so the game plan can make the difference between win-
       akin to an athletic team’s “game plan” in the sense that both a           ning and losing.
       strategic plan and a game plan are developed after carefully study-            Most of the strategies described in this chapter would separately
       ing rival firms (teams); success of the firm (or team) depends greatly    yield substantial benefits for firms, but no firm has sufficient re-
       on that plan being a better plan than the rival’s plan. Any strategist,   sources to pursue more than a few basic strategies. Thus, strategists
       much like any coach, puts his or her firm in great jeopardy of failure    must select from a number of excellent alternatives, eliminate other
       if the opposing strategist (coach) has a better strategic plan.           excellent options, and consider risks, tradeoffs, costs, and other key
            Value chain analysis and benchmarking are required to create,        factors. Any strategist, or coach, that gets “outstrategized” by his
       identify, nurture, and exploit sustained competitive advantages that      or her opposing strategist (or coach) puts his or her firm (or team) at
       can lead to success. Parity (and commoditization) is becoming com-        a major disadvantage. Being outcoached can doom even a superior
       monplace in both business and athletics; as parity increases, the         team (or firm). Therefore, in Chapter 6 we examine six additional
       intrinsic value of the overarching strategic plan, or game plan, in-      analytical tools being widely used by strategists to help develop a
       creases exponentially. For example, in college football, great parity     winning strategic plan.

               Chapter Summary
               The main appeal of any managerial approach is the expectation that it will enhance organiza-
               tional performance. This is especially true of strategic management. Through involvement in
               strategic-management activities, managers and employees achieve a better understanding of an
               organization’s priorities and operations. Strategic management allows organizations to be effi-
               cient, but more importantly, it allows them to be effective. Although strategic management does
               not guarantee organizational success, the process allows proactive rather than reactive decision
               making. Strategic management may represent a radical change in philosophy for some organi-
               zations, so strategists must be trained to anticipate and constructively respond to questions and
               issues as they arise. The strategies discussed in this chapter can represent a new beginning for
               many firms, especially if managers and employees in the organization understand and support
               the plan for action.
                    This chapter reveals that firms can “grow” internally (organically) or by acquiring or coop-
               erating with other firms. Guidelines are given in this chapter for when firms have been most suc-
               cessful historically pursuing which strategies by what means. Companies and industries change,
               but the material presented in this chapter should be relevant and useful for decades to come as
               companies strive to gain and sustain competitive advantage. In a nutshell, this chapter empha-
               sizes that companies need to continuously manage and improve their value chain activities rang-
               ing from raw material securement to end product marketing to be successful.

                                  Purpose
                                  Comparing what is planned versus what you recommend is an important part of case analysis. Do not
                                  recommend what the firm actually plans, unless in-depth analysis of the situation reveals those strate-
                                  gies to be best among all feasible alternatives. This exercise gives you experience conducting research
                                  to determine what a firm is doing in 2018–2019 and should do in 2020–2021.

                                  Purpose
                                  It is important for representatives from all areas of a college or university to identify and discuss al-
                                  ternative strategies that could benefit faculty, students, alumni, staff, and other constituencies. As you
                                  complete this exercise, notice the learning and understanding that occurs as people express differences
                                  of opinion. Recall that the process of planning is more important than the document.
                                  Instructions
                                  Step 1         Recall or locate the external opportunity and threat and internal strength and weakness fac-
                                                 tors that you identified as part of Exercise 1A (p. 65). If you did not do that exercise, discuss
                                                 now as a class important external and internal factors facing your college or university.
                                  Step 2         Identify and put on the screen 10 alternative strategies that you feel could benefit your col-
                                                 lege or university. Your proposed actions should allow the institution to capitalize on par-
                                                 ticular strengths, improve on certain weaknesses, avoid external threats, or take advantage
                                                 of particular external opportunities. Number the strategies as they are written on the screen
                                                 from 1 to 10. State each strategy in specific terms, such as “Build two new dormitories,”
                                                 rather than in vague terms, such as “Do market penetration.”
                                  Step 3         On a separate sheet of paper, number from 1 to 10. Everyone in class individually should
                                                 rate the strategies identified, using a 1 to 3 scale, where 1 = I do not support implementation,
                                                 2 = I am neutral about implementation, and 3 = I strongly support implementation. In rating
                                                 the strategies, recognize that no institution has sufficient funds to do everything desired or
                                                 potentially beneficial.
                                  Step 4         Your professor will now pick up the rating sheets and have a student add up the scores for each
                                                 strategy. That is, sum the ratings for each strategy, so that a prioritized list of recommended
                                                 strategies is obtained. The higher the sum, the more attractive the strategy. This prioritized list
                                                 reflects the collective wisdom of your class. Strategies with the highest score are deemed best.
                                  Step 5         Discuss how this process could enable organizations to achieve understanding and commit-
                                                 ment from individuals.

               The Key to Personal Strategic Planning: Simultaneously
               Build and Borrow
               Purpose
               As a means to achieve various strategies, companies usually choose between “build, borrow, and buy”
               to grow. However, individuals must build and borrow. This exercise gives you insight on how to build
               and borrow to launch a successful career.
               Instructions
               Step 1             List four ways you can BUILD (i.e., grow internally) to advance your career opportunities.
               Step 2             List four ways you can BORROW (i.e., grow using others) to advance your career
                                  opportunities.
               Step 3             Compare and contrast your lists with those of other students. Collectively decide on the four
                                  best BUILD and four best BORROW means to achieve your objectives.


               SET 4: INDIVIDUAL VERSUS GROUP STRATEGIC PLANNING

               EXERCISE 5E

               What Is the Best Mix of Strategies for Coca-Cola
               Company?
               Purpose
               Strategic-management classes are usually composed of team of students who perform case analysis.
               The purpose of this exercise is to examine whether individual decision making is better than group de-
               cision making. Academic research suggests that groups make better decisions than individuals about
               80 percent of the time. No company has sufficient resources to implement all strategies that would
               benefit the firm. Thus, tough choices have to be made. Ranking strategies as to their relative attrac-
               tiveness (1 = most attractive, 2 = next most attractive, etc.) is a commonly used procedure to help
               determine which actions to actually fund. Often, a group of managers will jointly rank strategies and
               compare their ranking to other groups. This ranking process may be used to determine the relative at-
               tractiveness of feasible alternative strategies.
                   The purpose of this exercise is to examine how well students understand the advantages and dis-
               advantages of a firm pursuing the strategic options described in Chapter 5. This is a fun exercise that
               also gives you experience selecting among feasible alternative strategies for a company.
               Situation
               Coca-Cola is doing really well, but wants to do better. Coca-Cola is trying to decide what strategies
               would be best for the company going forward. Seven strategies discussed in Chapter 5 are being seri-
               ously considered, as listed.
               Strategies
               Production operations
                   1. Forward integration: Build 100 Coca-Cola stores.
                   2. Backward integration: Purchase a 10,000-acre sugarcane farm to gain better control over sup-
                      plies needed for Coca-Cola retail stores globally.
                   3. Horizontal integration: Acquire four beverage brands from Dr Pepper Snapple.
                   4. Market development: Build a manufacturing plant in Africa to better serve that continent.
                   5. Market penetration: Launch an advertising, promotion, and publicity campaign globally to shift
                      public perception of Coca-Cola from unhealthy to healthy.
                   6. Product development: Develop, produce, and launch a full line of organic juices.
                   7. Unrelated diversification: Acquire a construction company to handle building new stores and
                      manufacturing plants and distribution centers globally.

    186    PART 2 • STRATEGY FORMULATION

                                  Task
                                  Rank the seven strategies listed in terms of their relative attractiveness for Coca-Cola, where 1 = the most
                                  attractive strategy to pursue, 2 = the next most attractive strategy, etc. to 7 = the least attractive strategy
                                  to pursue. Rank the strategies first as an individual, and then as part a group. Then, listen to the EXPERT
                                  ranking and rationale. In this manner, this exercise enables you to determine what individual(s) and what
                                  group(s) in class make the best strategic decisions (i.e., that come closest to the expert ranking).
                                  Steps
                                   1. Fill in Column 1 in Table 5-9 to reveal your individual ranking of the relative attractiveness of
                                      the proposed strategies. For example, if you feel backward integration is the seventh-best op-
                                      tion, then in Table 5-9, enter a 7 in Column 1 beside Backward Integration.
                                   2. Fill in Column 2 in Table 5-9 to reveal your group’s ranking of the relative attractiveness of the
                                      proposed strategies. For example, if your group feels backward integration is the third-best op-
                                      tion, then enter 3 into Column 2 beside backward integration.
                                   3. Fill in Column 3 in Table 5-9 to reveal the expert’s ranking of the relative attractiveness of the
                                      proposed strategies.
                                   4. Fill in Column 4 in Table 5-9 to reveal the absolute difference between Column 1 and Column
                                      3 to reveal how well you performed as an individual in this exercise. (Note: Absolute difference
                                      disregards negative numbers.)
                                   5. Fill in Column 5 in Table 5-9 to reveal the absolute difference between Column 2 and Column 3
                                      to reveal how well your group performed in this exercise.
                                   6. Sum Column 4. Sum Column 5.
                                   7. Compare the Column 4 sum with the Column 5 sum. If your Column 4 sum is less than your
                                      Column 5 sum, then you performed better as an individual than as a group. If you did better
                                      than your group, you did excellent.
                                   8. The Individual Winner(s): The individual(s) with the lowest Column 4 sum is the WINNER.
                                   9. The Group Winners(s): The group(s) with the lowest Column 5 score is the WINNER.

                 MINI-CASE ON FACEBOOK (FB)

               SHOULD FACEBOOK ACQUIRE, COOPERATE,
               OR JUST STAY FIERCE RIVALS WITH
               LINKEDIN?
               This chapter discussed rival firms merging, cooperating, or staying rivals. Headquartered in Menlo
               Park, California, Facebook is by far the largest online social-networking company in the world.
               Headquartered in Mountain View, California, LinkedIn is the largest online professional network de-
               signed to help members find jobs, connect with other professionals, and locate business opportunities.
               The two companies are becoming more and more rivals as their business model becomes more and
               more similar. Both websites are free for members to join and both earn money through advertis-
               ing spots. LinkedIn also earns revenue through its job-listing service. Companies post job openings
               on LinkedIn and search for candidates on LinkedIn—particularly advantageous for students nearing
               graduation. Facebook wants some of this action. Members of LinkedIn tend to be white collar and
               highly educated; 45 percent of LinkedIn visitors earn more than $75,000 per year. Facebook has
               nearly 3 billion members across the whole economic spectrum of income.
                   As evidence of the two firms gravitating toward each other in products and services, LinkedIn re-
               cently rolled out its video uploading feature, trying to become more like Facebook. Facebook is testing
               new professional (rather than social) features trying to take market share from LinkedIn. Both com-
               panies’ primary strategy is product development. Both Facebook and LinkedIn continually develop
               new and improved, visible and invisible, business analytics models to gather and assimilate data, and
               then sell the data. LinkedIn has developed a big-data framework dubbed Gobblin that helps the social
               network collect tons of data from a variety of sources so that it can be analyzed in its Hadoop-based
               data warehouses. The company also houses a variety of internal data (information pertaining to mem-
               ber profiles, user actions such as comments and clicking, and so on) in databases such as Espresso
               and event-logging systems such as Kafka. Also, LinkedIn takes in data from outside sources—for
               instance, Salesforce and Twitter. Facebook is testing a mentorship feature to help Facebook members
               identify and spend time with professionals based on common interests. Facebook is also testing a
               LinkedIn-like resume feature. Many people prefer to keep their social activities (Facebook) separate
               from their professional activities (LinkedIn), but as these two firms become more and more similar,
               separation becomes cloudier.

               Questions
                1. Should Facebook develop features to allow people to efficiently hunt for jobs on their website,
                   including posting their professional vita?
                2. Should Facebook develop features to allow businesses to hunt for employees on their website,
                   including posting job descriptions and job vacancies?
                3. Should LinkedIn develop features to allow people to post personal pictures and videos on their
                   website?
                4. Should LinkedIn and Facebook merge? What are the pros and cons of merger for the two firms?
                5. Should LinkedIn and Facebook cooperate rather than merge? Identify and describe three ways
                   the two rival firms could cooperate in mutually beneficial ways.

                                             trategy analysis and choice largely involve making subjective decisions based on objective
                                             information. Prior chapters in this text focused on obtaining the objective information
                                             needed in this chapter to formulate strategies and decide upon particular strategies to
                                       implement. This chapter introduces important concepts that enable strategists to generate fea-
                                       sible alternatives, evaluate those alternatives, and choose a specific course of action. Behavioral
                                       aspects of strategy formulation are also covered in this chapter, including politics, culture,
                                       ethics, and social responsibility considerations. Modern tools for formulating strategies are
                                       described. Material in this chapter, as well as in prior chapters, largely follows the flow of the
                                       Excel strategic-planning template at www.strategyclub.com that is available for students to

                                       planning “right by the book.”


                            LO 6.1     Strategy Analysis and Choice
                                       As indicated by Figure 6-1 with white shading, this chapter focuses on generating and evaluat-
                                       ing alternative strategies, as well as selecting strategies to pursue. Strategy analysis and choice
                                       seek to determine alternative courses of action that could best enable the firm to achieve its mis-
                                       sion and objectives. The firm’s present strategies, objectives, vision, and mission, coupled with
                                       the external and internal audit information, provide a basis for generating and evaluating feasible
                                       alternative strategies. This systematic approach is an effective way to avoid an organizational
                                       crisis. Rudin’s Law states, “When a crisis forces choosing among alternatives, most people
                                       choose the worst possible one.”
                                            Unless underlying EFE, CPM, and IFE matrices produced really low total weighted scores,
                                       alternative strategies will likely represent incremental steps that move the firm from its present
                                       position to a desired future position. Alternative strategies should not come out of the wild blue
                                       yonder; they are derived from the firm’s vision, mission, objectives, external audit, and internal
                                       audit; they are consistent with, or build on, past strategies that have worked well.

               The Process of Generating and Selecting Strategies
               Strategists never consider all feasible strategies that could benefit the firm because there is an
               infinite number of possible actions and an infinite number of ways to implement those actions.
               Therefore, a manageable set of the most attractive alternative strategies must be developed, ex-
               amined, prioritized, and selected. The advantages, disadvantages, trade-offs, costs, and benefits
               of these strategies should be determined.
                    Identifying and evaluating strategies should involve many of the managers and employees
               who previously assembled the organizational vision and mission statements, performed the
               external audit, and conducted the internal audit. Representatives from each department and
               division of the firm should be included in this process, as was the case in previous strategy-
               formulation activities. Involvement provides the best opportunity for managers and employees
               to gain an understanding of what the firm is doing and why and to become committed to helping
               the firm accomplish its objectives.
                    All participants in the strategy analysis and choice activity should have the firm’s external
               and internal audit information available. This information, coupled with the firm’s vision and
               mission statements, will help participants crystallize in their own minds particular strategies
               that they believe could benefit the firm most. Creativity should be encouraged in this thought
               process. At a bare minimum, SWOT analysis should be performed by participants as described
               in this chapter. Additionally, BCG, IE, SPACE, GRAND, and QSPM analyses are always im-
               mensely helpful in strategic planning.


               The Strategy-Formulation Analytical Framework                                                                LO 6.2
               Important strategy-formulation techniques can be integrated into a three-stage decision-making
               framework, as shown in Figure 6-2. The tools presented in this framework are applicable to all
               sizes and types of organizations and can help strategists identify, evaluate, and select strategies.
               The tools enable firms to break down complex data and ultimately establish an effective strategic
               plan. The tools shown anchor the analytical strategic-planning process advocated by the authors
               and this text.
                    All nine techniques included in the strategy-formulation analytical framework require
               the integration of intuition and analysis. Autonomous divisions in an organization commonly use
               strategy-formulation techniques to develop strategies and objectives. Divisional analyses provide
               a basis for identifying, evaluating, and selecting among alternative corporate-level strategies.
                    Strategists themselves, not analytical tools, are always responsible and accountable for
               strategic decisions. Lenz emphasized that the shift from a words-oriented to a numbers-
               oriented planning process can give rise to a false sense of certainty; it can reduce dialogue,

                                  information and analysis, however, personal biases, politics, prejudices, emotions, personalities,
                                  and halo error (the tendency to put too much weight on a single factor) often play too dominant
                                  of a role in the strategy-formulation process, undermining effectiveness. Thus, an analytical ap-
                                  proach is essential for achieving maximum effectiveness in strategic planning.


                                  Stage 1: The Input Stage
                                  Stage 1 of the strategy-formulation analytical framework consists of the External Factor
                                  Evaluation (EFE) Matrix, the Internal Factor Evaluation (IFE) Matrix, and the Competitive
                                  Profile Matrix (CPM). Called the input stage, Stage 1 summarizes the basic input information
                                  needed to formulate strategies. Procedures for developing an EFE, CPM, and IFE Matrix were
                                  presented in Chapters 3 and 4, respectively. Information derived from those analytical tools
                                  provides basic input information for the matching and decision stage matrices described in this
                                  chapter. The input tools require strategists to quantify subjectivity during early stages of the
                                  strategy-formulation process. Making small decisions in the input matrices regarding the relative
                                  importance of external and internal factors allows strategists to more effectively generate, priori-
                                  tize, evaluate, and select among alternative strategies. Good intuitive judgment is always needed
                                  in determining appropriate weights and ratings, but keep in mind that a rating of 3, for example,
                                  is mathematically 50 percent larger than a rating of 2, so small differences matter.


                                  Stage 2: The Matching Stage
                                  Stage 2, called the matching stage, focuses on generating feasible alternative strategies by align-
                                  ing key external and internal factors. Stage 2 techniques include the Strengths-Weaknesses-
                                  Opportunities-Threats (SWOT) Matrix, the Strategic Position and Action Evaluation (SPACE)
                                  Matrix, the Boston Consulting Group (BCG) Matrix, the Internal-External (IE) Matrix, and the
                                  Grand Strategy Matrix.
                                       Strategy is sometimes defined as the match an organization makes between its internal
                                  resources and skills and the external opportunities and risks facing the firm.2 The matching
                                  stage of the strategy-formulation framework consists of five techniques that can be used in
                                  any sequence: the SWOT Matrix, the SPACE Matrix, the BCG Matrix, the IE Matrix, and the
                                  Grand Strategy Matrix. These tools rely on information derived from the input stage to match
                                  external opportunities and threats with internal strengths and weaknesses. Matching external
                                  and internal key factors is essential for effectively generating feasible alternative strategies. In
                                  most situations, external and internal relationships are complex, and matching requires multiple
                                  alignments for each strategy generated. Successful matching of key external and internal factors
                                  depends on those underlying key factors being actionable, quantitative, comparative, and divi-
                                  sional (AQCD) to the extent possible. (Recall that the basic concept of matching was introduced
                                  in Chapter 1).

                                  Stage 3: The Decision Stage
                                  Stage 3, called the decision stage, involves a single technique, the Quantitative Strategic
                                  Planning Matrix (QSPM). A QSPM uses input information from Stage 1 to objectively evaluate
                                  feasible alternative strategies identified in Stage 2. It reveals the relative attractiveness of alterna-
                                  tive strategies and thus provides an objective basis for selecting specific strategies. The QSPM is
                                  a more robust way to determine the relative attractiveness of strategies than the summed ranking
                                  method described previously.
                                       Alternative strategies proposed by SWOT, BCG, IE, SPACE, and GRAND analyses should
                                  be considered and discussed in a meeting or series of meetings. Proposed strategies should be
                                  listed in writing. When all feasible strategies identified by participants are stated in specific
                                  terms and understood, the strategies should be individually rated in order of attractiveness by
                                  each participant, with 1 = should not be implemented, 2 = possibly should be implemented,
                                  3 = probably should be implemented, and 4 = definitely should be implemented. Then, collect
                                  the participants’ rating sheets and sum the ratings given for each strategy to end up with a useful

               ranking of the strategies. Strategies with the highest sums are deemed the most attractive, so this
               process results in a prioritized list of best strategies that reflects the collective wisdom of the
               group. Rather than, or in conjunction with, this ranking method, the QSPM, described later in
               this chapter, offers a more robust procedure to determine the relative attractiveness of alternative
               strategies.


               The SWOT Matrix                                                                                        LO 6.3
               Recall that SWOT analysis was introduced in Chapter 1 (p. 42). There are four sets of strate-
               gies developed in SWOT analysis: SO, WO, ST, and WT. SO strategies use a firm’s internal
               strengths to take advantage of external opportunities. All managers would like their organization
               to be in a position in which internal strengths can be used to take advantage of external trends
               and events. Organizations generally will pursue WO, ST, or WT strategies to more effectively
               position themselves into situations in which they can apply SO strategies.
                    WO strategies aim at improving internal weaknesses by taking advantage of external op-
               portunities. Sometimes key external opportunities exist, but a firm has internal weaknesses that
               prevent it from exploiting those opportunities. For example, for an auto parts manufacturer, the
               rising demand for electric cars (external opportunity), coupled with the firm having limited bat-
               teries to offer (internal weakness), suggests that the firm should consider developing and pro-
               ducing a new line of batteries.
                    ST strategies use a firm’s strengths to avoid or reduce the impact of external threats. An
               example ST strategy could be when a firm uses its excellent legal department (a strength) to col-
               lect millions of dollars in damages from rival firms that infringe on its patents. Rival firms that
               copy ideas, innovations, and patented products are a threat to many industries. When an organi-
               zation faces major threats, it will seek to avoid them while concentrating on opportunities. For
               example, when an organization has both the capital and human resources needed to distribute its
               own products (internal strengths) and distributors are unreliable, costly, or incapable of meeting
               the firm’s needs (external threats), forward integration (gaining control of distributors) can be an
               attractive ST strategy.
                    WT strategies are defensive tactics directed at reducing internal weakness and avoiding
               external threats. An organization faced with numerous external threats and internal weaknesses
               may indeed be in a precarious position. In fact, such a firm may have to fight for its survival,
               merge, retrench, declare bankruptcy, or choose to liquidate. For example, some restaurant chains
               do business with suppliers that treat livestock inhumanely (internal weakness) and face grow-
               ing customer awareness of the need to preserve wildlife and treat animals with respect (external
               threat)—resulting in a WT strategy to cease using certain suppliers. As another example, when
               a firm has excess production capacity (internal weakness) and its basic industry is experiencing
               declining annual sales and profits (external threat), related diversification can be an effective WT
               strategy.
                    Whatever strategies are ultimately chosen for implementation, ethics issues are a consider-
               ation. For example, as indicated in Ethics Capsule 6 on the next page, consumers are more sensi-
               tive to how animals are treated than ever before.
                    An example SWOT Matrix is illustrated in Figure 6-3, on the next page. As shown, there
               are nine cells: four key factor cells, four strategy cells, and one cell that is always left blank
               (the u­ pper-left cell). The four strategy cells, labeled SO, WO, ST, and WT, are developed after
               ­completing four key factor cells, labeled S, W, O, and T. (Author comment: The strategic-planning
                template at www.strategyclub.com simply leaves a space to type in SO, WO, ST, and WT s­ trategies.
                The process of constructing a SWOT Matrix can be summarized in eight steps, as follows:
                   1.   List the firm’s key internal strengths.
                   2.   List the firm’s key internal weaknesses.
                   3.   List the firm’s key external opportunities.
                   4.   List the firm’s key external threats.
                   5.   Match internal strengths with external opportunities to develop specific SO strategies.
                   6.   Match internal weaknesses with external opportunities to develop specific WO strategies.
                   7.   Match internal strengths with external threats to develop specific ST strategies.
                   8.   Match internal weaknesses with external threats to develop specific WT strategies.

                    Some important aspects of a SWOT Matrix are evidenced in Figure 6-3. For example, note
               that both the internal and external factors and the SO, ST, WO, and WT strategies are stated in
               specific terms. This is important! For example, regarding the second SO strategy (SO2), if the
               analyst simply said, “Add new repair and service persons,” the reader may conclude that 20 new
               repair and service persons are needed, when only 2 are needed. So, in stating strategies, be as
               quantitative and divisional as possible. Furthermore, remember to consult the vision and mission
               statements of the firm; and keep in mind what the firm considers its competitive advantages or
               core competencies based on its value chain analysis. Take care to develop SO, WO, ST, and WT
               strategies based on these considerations as well as the factors receiving the highest weights from
               your EFE and IFE Matrices.
                    Regarding specificity, for each SWOT strategy included in the matrix, ask yourself this
               question: “Is the strategy stated specifically enough to estimate the cost (or savings) if it is se-
               lected for implementation?” If the answer is NO, then the strategy is too vague as stated. Thus,
               whenever words such as “expand, increase, decrease, more, or reduce” are used in a SWOT
               Matrix, clarify with a percent or number exactly what you are proposing. There is no need to
               give estimated costs in a SWOT Matrix, but the information must be specific enough to generate
               these numbers if the particular strategy is selected for implementation. Vagueness is disastrous
               in strategic planning, especially in a SWOT Matrix.
                    As shown in Figure 6-3, it is important to include the “S1, O2” notation after each strategy
               in a SWOT Matrix. This notation reveals the rationale for each alternative strategy in terms of
               the internal and external factors that were “matched” to formulate desirable strategies. For ex-
               ample, note that this retail computer store business may need to “purchase land to build a new
               store” because a new Highway 34 will make the current location less desirable. The “S4, T5”
               type of notation, given after each strategy in a SWOT Matrix, accents that “strategies do not
               come out of the blue yonder.”
                    The purpose of SWOT analysis and each Stage 2 matching tool is to generate a list of
               feasible, specific alternative strategies, not to select or determine which strategies are best.
               Not all of the strategies developed in the SWOT Matrix will be selected for implementa-
               tion. No firm has sufficient capital or resources to implement every strategy formulated.
               As a rule of thumb, include at least four strategies in each SO, ST, WO and WT quadrant to
               encompass all aspects of the business; usually a SWOT matrix, thus, will include 16 strate-
               gies total.
                    Although the SWOT Matrix is widely used in strategic planning, the analysis does include
               limitations.3 First, SWOT analysis does not reveal how to achieve a competitive advantage, so
               it must not be an end in itself. The analysis should be the starting point for a discussion on
               how proposed strategies could be implemented as well as cost-benefit, uniqueness, and trad-
               eoff considerations that ultimately could lead to competitive advantage. Second, SWOT is a
               static assessment (or snapshot) in time. As circumstances, capabilities, threats, and strategies
               change, the dynamics of a competitive environment may not be revealed in a single matrix.
               Third, there are interrelationships among the key internal and external factors that SWOT does
               not reveal, but that may be important in devising strategies. Fourth, there are no weights or
               ratings in a SWOT analysis. Finally, the relative attractiveness of alternative strategies is not
               provided.


               The Strategic Position and Action Evaluation (SPACE)                                                   LO 6.4
               Matrix
               The Strategic Position and Action Evaluation (SPACE) Matrix is another Stage 2 matching
               tool that uses two axes and four quadrants to reveal whether aggressive, conservative, defensive,
               or competitive strategies are most appropriate for a given organization. Axes of the SPACE
               Matrix represent two internal dimensions (financial position [FP] and competitive position
               [CP]) and two external dimensions (stability position [SP] and industry position [IP]). To
               perform SPACE analysis, simply rate a company on each of the four dimensions (axes) named
               above and revealed in Figure 6-4.4
                    Depending on the type of organization, numerous variables could make up each of the di-
               mensions represented on the axes of the SPACE Matrix. Factors that were included in the firm’s
               EFE and IFE Matrices should be considered in developing a SPACE Matrix. Other variables

                                  Steps in Performing SPACE Analysis
                                  The process of developing a SPACE Matrix can be summarized in six steps.
                                  Step 1     Select a set of variables to define financial position (FP), competitive position (CP),
                                             stability position (SP), and industry position (IP).
                                             1. Let’s first elaborate on the difference between the SP and IP axes. The term SP
                                                refers to the volatility of profits and revenues for firms in a given industry based
                                                on the factors considered in the SPACE. Thus, SP volatility (stability) is based
                                                on the expected impact of changes in profits by volatility in core external factors
                                                such as technology, economy, demographic, seasonality, and so on. The higher
                                                the ­frequency and magnitude of profitability changes in a given industry, the more
                                                unstable the SP becomes. An industry can be stable or unstable on SP, yet high or
                                                low on IP. The robotics industry, for instance, would be unstable (-7) on the SP
                                                axis due to constant developments and upgrades, yet high growth on the IP axis
                                                (+7), whereas the canned food industry would be stable (-1) on the SP axis, yet low
                                                growth on the IP axis (+1).

                           Regarding the FP axis, simply rate the firm on numerous financial variables where +7
                           is really strong and +1 is really weak. Similarly, on the CP axis, simply rate the firm
                           as per its relative position on numerous variables versus rival firms, where -7 is really
                           weak and -1 is really strong.
               Step 2      Assign a numerical value ranging from +1 (worst) to +7 (best) to each of the variables
                           that make up the FP and IP dimensions. Assign a numerical value ranging from -1
                           (best) to -7 (worst) to each of the variables that make up the SP and CP dimensions.
                           On the FP and CP axes, make comparisons to competitors. For example, a +7 on any
                           FP or IP factor is outstanding, whereas a +1 is terrible. On the IP and SP axes, make
                           comparisons to other industries. On the SP axis, know that a -7 on any factor denotes
                           a highly unstable industry condition (unattractive), whereas -1 denotes a highly stable
                           industry condition (attractive).
               Step 3      Compute an average score for FP, CP, IP, and SP by summing the values given to the
                           variables of each dimension and then by dividing by the number of variables included
                           in the respective dimension.
               Step 4      Plot the average scores for FP, IP, SP, and CP on the appropriate axes in the SPACE Matrix.
               Step 5      Add the two scores on the x-axis and plot the resultant point on X. Add the two scores on
                           the y-axis and plot the resultant point on Y. Plot the intersection of the new (x, y) coordinate.
               Step 6      Draw a directional vector from the origin of the SPACE Matrix (0,0) through the new
                           (x, y) coordinate. That vector, being located in a particular quadrant, reveals particular
                           strategies the firm should consider. Author comment: The template plots the new (x, y)
                           coordinate, rather than drawing a vector; the template also lets you estimate (x, y)
                           coordinates for rival firms without averaging SP, CP, IP, and FP values.

               is located in the Aggressive Quadrant (upper right) of the SPACE Matrix, an organization is
               in an excellent position to use its internal strengths to (1) take advantage of external opportuni-
               ties, (2) overcome internal weaknesses, and (3) avoid external threats. Therefore, as indicated in
               Figure 6-4, market penetration, market development, product development, backward integra-
               tion, forward integration, horizontal integration, or diversification, can be feasible, depending on
               the specific circumstances that face the firm.
                     When performing SPACE analysis for a particular firm, be specific in terms of recom-
               mended strategies. For example, instead of saying market penetration is a recommended strat-
               egy when a vector is located in the Aggressive Quadrant, say “adding 34 new stores in India
               is the proposed strategy.” This is an important point for students doing case analyses because
               whenever a particular company is known, then the terms learned in Chapter 5 on page 182,
               such as market development, must be quantified to enable specific recommendations to be
               proposed. The term “market development” could refer to adding a manufacturing plant in
               Thailand or Mexico or Kenya. Thus, be specific to the extent possible regarding implications
               of all the matrices presented in this chapter. Vagueness is disastrous in strategic management.
               Avoid terms such as expand, increase, decrease, and grow, unless accompanying numbers are
               provided.
                     The SPACE directional vector may appear in the Conservative Quadrant (upper left),
               which implies staying close to the firm’s basic competencies and not taking excessive risks.
               As indicated in Figure 6-4, conservative strategies most often include market penetra-
               tion, market development, product development, and related diversification. The SPACE
               directional vector may be located in the Defensive Quadrant (lower left), which suggests
               the firm should focus on improving internal weaknesses and avoiding external threats.
               Defensive strategies include retrenchment, divestiture, liquidation, and related diversifica-
               tion. Finally, the SPACE directional vector may be located in the Competitive Quadrant
               (lower right), indicating competitive strategies. Competitive strategies include backward,
               forward, and horizontal integration; market penetration; market development; and product
               development—as indicated in Figure 6-4.
                     Like the SWOT Matrix, the SPACE Matrix should be tailored to the particular organization
               being studied and based on factual information to the extent possible. Include specific factors;
               for example, Delta Airlines may include “volatility of oil prices” as a factor under SP with a rat-
               ing of -6. To the degree factors are unique to a particular firm and industry, the more effective
               the SPACE results will be in suggesting possible generic strategies to implement.
                     SPACE analysis is an excellent tool for transferring complex information into a manageable
               list of strategies to consider for implementation. SPACE analysis can be helpful in deciding how
               aggressive or defensive a firm should be—so it’s important to always include SPACE analysis in
               doing strategic planning.
                     A SPACE Matrix analysis has some limitations as follows:
                   1. It is a snapshot in time.
                   2. There are more than four dimensions that firms could/should be rated on.
                   3. The directional vector could fall directly on an axis, or could even go nowhere if the
                      coordinate is (0,0). Whenever this happens, analysts usually add a few more evaluative
                      criteria that comprise the FP (and any other) axis to make the vector shift into a particular
                      quadrant.
                   4. Implications of the exact angle of the vector within a quadrant are unclear.
                   5. The relative attractiveness of alternative strategies generated is unclear.
               The SPACE Matrix has been used to help identify Facebook’s overall strategic position as pro-
               vided in Figure 6-6. As noted in Figure 6-6, Facebook falls in the Aggressive Quadrant. Note
               the factors used to construct the SPACE Matrix are specific to Facebook and the social media
               industry. An implication of the Facebook SPACE analysis is that the company should more ag-
               gressively add professional networking services, similar to rival firm LinkedIn, or perhaps even
               acquire LinkedIn.

                                     BCG is a private management consulting firm that specializes in strategic planning. Based in
                                     Boston, Massachusetts and employing 6,200 consultants worldwide, BCG has approximately
                                     90 offices in 45 countries, and annually ranks in the top five of Fortune’s list of the “100 Best
                                     Companies to Work For.”
                                         Autonomous divisions (also called segments or profit centers) of an organization make up
                                     what is called a business portfolio. When a firm’s divisions compete in different industries,

               a separate strategy must often be developed for each business. The BCG Matrix is designed
               specifically to enhance a multidivisional firm’s efforts to formulate strategies. Allocating re-
               sources across divisions is arguably the most important strategic decision facing multidivisional
               firms. Multidivisional firms range in size from small, three-restaurant, mom-and-pop firms, to
               huge conglomerates such as Walt Disney Company, to universities that have various schools or
               ­colleges—and they all need to use portfolio analysis—a tool that compares divisions of a firm
                to determine how best to allocate resources among those divisions.
                     In a Form 10K or Annual Report, and sometimes in quarterly reports, most companies
                disclose revenues and sometimes operating profits by segment. BCG portfolio analysis can
                be performed based on whatever information is provided, such as the location of all the firm’s
                stores or branches. In the BCG matrices in this chapter, the size of circles correspond to seg-
                ment revenues (or number of stores), and pie slices within circles correspond to segment operat-
                ing profits. Let regions be the basis for BCG circles if needed. Reasons to disclose by-segment
                financial information in a Form 10K more than offset the reasons not to disclose, as indicated in
                Table 6-2.

                   1. Stakeholders will better understand the firm,     1. To avoid rival firms obtaining free competitive

                     The BCG Matrix graphically portrays differences among divisions based on two dimen-
               sions: (1) relative market share position on the x-axis, and (2) industry growth rate on the y-axis.
               The BCG Matrix allows a multidivisional organization to manage its portfolio of businesses by
               examining these two dimensions for each division relative to other divisions in the organization.
               Relative market share position (RMSP) is defined as the ratio of a division’s own market share
               (or revenues or number of stores) in a particular industry to the market share (or revenues or
               number of stores) held by the largest rival firm (leader) in that industry. In the U.S. candy indus-
               try, for example, Russell Stover’s relative market share position is Russell Stover’s market share
               divided by Hershey’s market share, or 1.6/25.9 = 0.062; similarly, Mars’ relative market share
               position is 25.2/25.9 = 0.973, as indicated in Table 6-3.

                                       Relative market share position is given on the x-axis of the BCG Matrix. The midpoint
                                  on the x-axis usually is set at 0.50, corresponding to a division that has half the market share
                                  of the leading firm in the industry. The y-axis represents the industry growth rate (IGR) in
                                  sales, measured in percentage terms—that is, the average annual increase in revenue for all
                                  firms in an industry. The growth rate percentages on the y-axis could range from −20 to +20
                                  (or -10 to +10) percent, with 0.0 being the midpoint. The average annual increase in revenues
                                  for several leading firms in the industry would be a good estimate for the IGR value. Also,
                                  various sources, such as the S&P Industry Surveys and www.finance.yahoo.com would pro-
                                  vide this value.
                                       Based on each division’s respective (x, y) coordinate, each segment can be properly po-
                                  sitioned in a BCG Matrix. Divisions located in Quadrant I (upper right) of the BCG Matrix
                                  are called “Question Marks,” those located in Quadrant II (upper left) are called “Stars,”
                                  those located in Quadrant III (lower left) are called “Cash Cows,” and those divisions lo-
                                  cated in Quadrant IV (lower right) are called “Dogs.” The four BCG quadrants are described
                                  below:

                                   •   Question Marks—Divisions in Quadrant I (upper right) have a low relative market share
                                       position, yet they compete in a high-growth industry. Generally, these firms’ cash needs are
                                       high and their cash generation is low. These businesses are called question marks because
                                       the organization must decide whether to strengthen them by pursuing an intensive strategy
                                       (market penetration, market development, or product development) or to sell them. An ex-
                                       ample question mark could be Snap’s portfolio of virtual reality technology devices; virtual
                                       reality is a high-growth industry, but Snap has a low relative market share.
                                   •   Stars—Divisions in Quadrant II (upper left) represent the organizations’ best long-run op-
                                       portunities for growth and profitability, and are therefore called stars. Divisions with a high
                                       relative market share and a high industry growth rate should receive substantial investment
                                       to maintain or strengthen their dominant positions. Forward, backward, and horizontal inte-
                                       gration; market penetration; market development; and product development are appropriate
                                       strategies for these divisions to consider, as indicated in Figure 6-7. A star example could
                                       be Facebook’s portfolio of virtual reality devices; Facebook is one of the leaders in the in-
                                       dustry in revenues in these devices.
                                   •   Cash Cows—Divisions in Quadrant III (lower left) have a high relative market share posi-
                                       tion but compete in a low-growth industry; they are called cash cows. Because they gener-
                                       ate cash in excess of their needs, they are often milked. Many of today’s cash cows were
                                       yesterday’s stars. Cash cow divisions should be managed to maintain their strong position
                                       for as long as possible. Product development, or diversification, may be an attractive strat-
                                       egy for strong cash cows. However, as a cash cow division becomes weak, retrenchment
                                       or divestiture can become more appropriate. A cash cow example is Hewlett-Packard (HP)
                                       with its desktop computers; HP is a market leader in terms of revenues, but desktop com-
                                       puters are a low-growth industry.
                                   •   Dogs—Divisions in Quadrant IV (lower right) have a low relative market share position
                                       and compete in a slow- or no-market-growth industry; they are dogs in the firm’s portfolio.
                                       Because of their weak internal and external position, these businesses are often liquidated,
                                       divested, or trimmed down through retrenchment. When a division first becomes a dog, re-
                                       trenchment can be the best strategy to pursue because many dogs have bounced back after
                                       strenuous asset and cost reduction to become viable, profitable divisions.

                                       The basic BCG Matrix appears in Figure 6-7. Each circle represents a separate division. The
                                  size of the circle corresponds to the proportion of corporate revenue generated by that business
                                  unit, and the pie slice indicates the proportion of corporate profits generated by that division.
                                       The major benefit of the BCG Matrix is that it draws attention to the cash flow, investment
                                  characteristics, and needs of an organization’s various divisions. The divisions of many firms
                                  evolve over time: dogs become question marks, question marks become stars, stars become cash
                                  cows, and cash cows become dogs in an ongoing counterclockwise motion. Less frequently,
                                  stars become question marks, question marks become dogs, dogs become cash cows, and cash
                                  cows become stars (in a clockwise motion). In some organizations, no cyclical motion is appar-
                                  ent. Over time, organizations should strive to achieve a portfolio of divisions that are stars.

                    An example of a BCG Matrix is provided in Figure 6-8, which illustrates an organization
               composed of five divisions with annual sales ranging from $5,000 to $60,000. Division 1 has
               the greatest sales volume, so the circle representing that division is the largest one in the matrix.
               The circle corresponding to Division 5 is the smallest because its sales volume ($5,000) is least
               among all the divisions. The pie slices within the circles reveal the percent of corporate profits
               contributed by each division. As shown, Division 1 contributes the highest profit percentage,
               39 percent, as indicated by 39 percent of the area within circle 1 being shaded. Notice in the
               diagram that Division 1 is considered a star, Division 2 is a question mark, Division 3 is also a
               question mark, Division 4 is a cash cow, and Division 5 is a dog.

                                               The BCG Matrix, like all analytical techniques, has some limitations. For example, viewing
                                          every business as a star, cash cow, dog, or question mark is an oversimplification; many busi-
                                          nesses fall right in the middle of the BCG Matrix and thus are not easily classified. Furthermore,
                                          the BCG Matrix does not reflect if various divisions or their industries are growing over time;
                                          that is, the matrix has no temporal qualities, but rather it is a snapshot of an organization at a
                                          given point in time. Finally, other variables besides relative market share position and industry
                                          growth rate in sales, such as the size of the market and competitive advantages, are important in
                                          making strategic decisions about various divisions.
                                               Another example BCG Matrix is provided in Figure 6-9. As you can see, Division 5 had an
                                          operating loss of $188 million as indicated by its red shading. The remaining pie slices add up to
                                          over 100 percent profits to account for negative net income associated with Division 5 (This is a
                                          different way to portray divisional losses in a BCG matrix analysis).

                              LO 6.6      The Internal-External (IE) Matrix
                                          The Internal-External (IE) Matrix positions an organization’s various divisions (segments)
                                          in a nine-cell display, as illustrated in Figure 6-10. The IE Matrix is similar to the BCG Matrix
                                          in that both tools involve plotting a firm’s divisions in a schematic diagram; this is why both
                                          tools are forms of portfolio analysis. In both the BCG and IE Matrices, the size of each circle
                                          represents the percentage of revenues or number of stores each division contributes, and pie
                                          slices reveal the percentage of operating profits contributed by each division. But there are
                                          four important differences between the BCG Matrix and the IE Matrix, as follows:
                                            1.   The x- and y-axes are different.
                                            2.   The IE Matrix requires more information about the divisions than does the BCG Matrix.
                                            3.   The strategic implications of each matrix are different.
                                            4.   The IE Matrix has nine quadrants versus four in a BCG Matrix.
                                              For the above reasons, strategists in multidivisional firms often develop both the BCG
                                          Matrix and the IE Matrix in formulating alternative strategies. A common practice is to develop

               a BCG Matrix and an IE Matrix for the present, and then develop projected matrices to reflect
               expectations of the future. This before-and-after analysis can be quite effective in an oral pre-
               sentation, enabling students (or strategists) to pave the way for (justify or give some rationale
               for) their recommendations across divisions of the firm. Also, commonly a BCG Matrix will be
               developed by region and an IE Matrix by product, or vice versa.
                    The IE Matrix is based on two key dimensions: (1) the IFE total weighted scores on the
               x-axis and (2) the EFE total weighted scores on the y-axis. Recall that each division of an or-
               ganization should construct an IFE Matrix and an EFE Matrix for its part of the organization,
               but usually in performing case analysis, strategic-management students simply estimate divi-
               sional IFE and EFE scores, rather than prepare those underlying matrices for every division.
               Regardless, it is the total weighted scores derived from the divisions that allow construction of
               the corporate-level IE Matrix. On the x-axis of the IE Matrix, an IFE total weighted score of 1.0
               to 1.99 represents a weak internal position; a score of 2.0 to 2.99 is considered average; and a
               score of 3.0 to 4.0 is strong. Similarly, on the y-axis, an EFE total weighted score of 1.0 to 1.99
               is considered weak; a score of 2.0 to 2.99 is average; and a score of 3.0 to 4.0 is strong. Circles,
               representing divisions, are positioned in an IE Matrix based on their (x, y) coordinate.
                    Despite having nine cells (or quadrants), the IE Matrix has three major regions that have dif-
               ferent strategy implications, as follows:
                   •   Region 1—The prescription for divisions that fall into cells I, II, or IV can be described as

                       strategies can be most appropriate for these divisions. This is the best region for divisions,
                       given their high IFE and EFE scores. Successful organizations are able to achieve a portfo-

    208    PART 2 • STRATEGY FORMULATION

                                                An example four-division IE Matrix is given in Figure 6-11. As indicated by the position-
                                           ing of the four circles, grow and build strategies are appropriate for Divisions 1, 2, and 3. But
                                           Division 4 is a candidate for harvest or divest. Division 2 contributes the greatest percentage of
                                           company sales and thus is represented by the largest circle. Division 1 contributes the greatest
                                           proportion of total profits; it has the largest-percentage pie slice.
                                                An example five-division IE Matrix is given in Figure 6-12. Note that Division 1 has the
                                           largest revenues (as indicated by the largest circle) and the largest profits (as indicated by the
                                           largest pie slice) in the matrix. It is common for organizations to develop both geographic and
                                           product-based IE Matrices to more effectively formulate strategies and allocate resources among
                                           divisions. This latter idea minimizes the limitation of these matrices being a “snapshot in time.”
                                                Important Note: Whenever a particular company is known, such as in doing case analysis or
                                           in the real world, be more specific with proposed strategies rather than using generic terms in re-
                                           gards to resultant IE Matrix strategies. Couch your strategies in quantitative and divisional terms
                                           to the extent possible. (This is true also with strategies derived from the BCG, SPACE, GRAND,
                                           and even SWOT analyses; specificity is golden—avoid vagueness)


                            LO 6.7         The Grand Strategy Matrix
                                           In addition to the SWOT Matrix, SPACE Matrix, BCG Matrix, and IE Matrix, the Grand
                                           Strategy Matrix is a popular tool for formulating alternative strategies. All organizations can
                                           be positioned in one of the Grand Strategy Matrix’s four strategy quadrants. A firm’s divisions
                                           likewise could be positioned. As illustrated in Figure 6-13, the Grand Strategy Matrix is based
                                           on two evaluative dimensions: (1) competitive position on the x-axis and (2) market (industry)
                                           growth on the y-axis. Any industry whose annual growth in sales exceeds 5 percent could be
                                           considered to have rapid growth. Appropriate strategies for an organization to consider are listed
                                           in sequential order of attractiveness in each quadrant of the Grand Strategy Matrix.

    210    PART 2 • STRATEGY FORMULATION

                                           Firms located in Quadrant I of the Grand Strategy Matrix are in an excellent strategic posi-
                                     tion. For these companies, continued concentration on current markets (market penetration and
                                     market development) and products (product development) is an appropriate strategy. It is unwise
                                     for a Quadrant I firm to shift notably from its established competitive advantages, yet all firms
                                     seek continual improvement. Thus, when a Quadrant I organization has excessive resources,
                                     then backward, forward, or horizontal integration may be considered. When a Quadrant I firm
                                     is too heavily committed to a single product, then related diversification may reduce the risks
                                     associated with a narrow product line. Quadrant I firms can afford to take advantage of external
                                     opportunities in several areas. They can take risks aggressively when necessary.
                                           Firms positioned in Quadrant II need to evaluate their present approach to the marketplace
                                     seriously. Although their industry is growing, they are unable to compete effectively; they need
                                     to determine why the firm’s current approach is ineffective and how the company can best
                                     change to improve its competitiveness. Because Quadrant II organizations are in a rapid market
                                     growth industry, an intensive strategy (as opposed to integrative or diversification) is usually the
                                     first option that should be considered. However, if the firm is lacking a distinctive competence
                                     or competitive advantage, then horizontal integration is often a desirable alternative. As a last
                                     resort, divestiture or liquidation should be considered. Divestiture can provide funds needed to
                                     acquire other businesses or buy back shares of stock.
                                           Quadrant III organizations compete in slow-growth industries and have weak competitive
                                     positions. These firms must make drastic changes quickly to avoid further decline and possible
                                     liquidation. Extensive cost and asset reduction (retrenchment) should be pursued first. An alter-
                                     native strategy is to shift resources away from the current business into different areas (diversify).
                                     If all else fails, the final options for Quadrant III businesses are divestiture or liquidation.
                                           Finally, Quadrant IV businesses have a strong competitive position but are in a slow-growth
                                     industry. These firms have the strength to launch diversified programs into more promising
                                     growth areas: Quadrant IV businesses have characteristically high cash-flow levels and limited
                                     internal growth needs and often can pursue related or unrelated diversification successfully.
                                     Quadrant IV firms also may pursue joint ventures.
                                           Even with the Grand Strategy Matrix, be certain that you always, whenever possible, state
                                     your alternative strategies in specific terms to the extent possible. For example, avoid using
                                     terms such as divestiture. Rather, specify the exact division to be sold. Also, be sure to use the
                                     free Excel student template at www.strategyclub.com that facilitates construction of all strategic
                                     planning matrices.
                                           If using the strategic planning template at www.strategyclub.com to perform GRAND analy-
                                     sis, you may use the 1 to 9 scale offered on the template, where 1 = the weakest competitive posi-
                                     tion and also the slowest industry growth rate, and 9 = the strongest competitive position and the
                                     fastest industry growth rate. Also, the template enables up to six points (coordinates) to be plotted
                                     in a Grand Strategy Matrix, analogous to various divisions of a firm, or rival firms, or even years
                                     to depict expected results of proposed recommendations. You may be creative in this regard.

                            LO 6.8   The Decision Stage: The QSPM
                                     Other than ranking strategies to achieve the prioritized list, as mentioned on page 194 near the
                                     start of this chapter, there is only one analytical technique in the literature designed to determine
                                     the relative attractiveness of feasible alternative plans or actions. The Quantitative Strategic
                                     Planning Matrix (QSPM), which comprises Stage 3 of the strategy-formulation analytical
                                     framework, objectively indicates which alternative strategies are best.5 The QSPM uses input
                                     from Stage 1 analyses and matching results from Stage 2 analyses to decide objectively among
                                     alternative strategies. That is, the EFE Matrix, IFE Matrix, and CPM that comprise Stage 1,
                                     coupled with the SWOT Matrix, SPACE Matrix, BCG Matrix, IE Matrix, and Grand Strategy
                                     Matrix that comprise Stage 2, provide the needed information for setting up the QSPM (Stage 3).
                                     The QSPM is a tool that allows strategists to evaluate alternative strategies objectively, based on
                                     previously identified external and internal key success factors. Like other strategy-formulation
                                     analytical tools, the QSPM requires the assignment of ratings (called attractiveness scores), but
                                     making “small” rating decisions enables strategists to make effective “big” decisions, such as
                                     which country to spend a billion dollars in to sell a product.

                    The basic format of the QSPM is illustrated in Table 6-4. Note that the left column of a
               QSPM consists of key external and internal factors (from Stage 1), and the top row consists of
               feasible alternative strategies (from Stage 2). Specifically, the left column of a QSPM consists
               of information obtained directly from the EFE Matrix and IFE Matrix. In a column adjacent to
               the key success factors, the respective weights received by each factor in the EFE Matrix and the
               IFE Matrix are recorded.
                    The top row of a QSPM consists of alternative strategies derived from the SWOT Matrix,
               SPACE Matrix, BCG Matrix, IE Matrix, and Grand Strategy Matrix. These matching tools
               usually generate similar feasible alternatives. However, not every strategy suggested by the
               matching techniques has to be evaluated in a QSPM. Strategists should compare several viable
               alternative strategies in a QSPM, perhaps including two or more SWOT strategies, so you could
               designate your QSPM strategies using SWOT notation such as SO4 versus WT3. Make sure
               your strategies are stated in specific terms, such as “Open 275 new stores in Indonesia” rather
               than “Expand globally” or “Open new stores in Africa.” Specificity is vital because ultimately
               a dollar value must be established for each recommended strategy; it would be impossible to
               establish a dollar value for “expand globally.” If you cannot reasonably assign a dollar value to
               a QSPM (or SWOT) strategy, then the strategy is too vague. Vagueness is disastrous in strategic
               planning because no one knows what you really are suggesting/saying, and a $1 billion invest-
               ment may be on the line.
                    Conceptually, the QSPM determines the relative attractiveness of various strategies based
               on the extent that key external and internal factors are capitalized on or improved. The relative
               attractiveness of each strategy is computed by determining the cumulative impact of each exter-
               nal and internal factor. Any number of strategies can be included in the QSPM.
                    A QSPM for a retail computer store is provided in Table 6-5. This example illustrates all the
               components of the QSPM: strategic alternatives, key factors, weights, attractiveness scores (AS),
               total attractiveness scores (TAS), and the sum total attractiveness score. The three new terms
               just introduced—(1) attractiveness score, (2) total attractiveness score, and (3) the sum total at-
               tractiveness score—are defined and explained as the six steps required to develop a QSPM are
               discussed:
               Step 1 Make a list of the firm’s key external opportunities and threats and internal
                      strengths and weaknesses in the left column of the QSPM. This information
                      should be taken directly from the EFE Matrix and IFE Matrix. (The Excel template at
                      www.strategyclub.com can facilitate this process.)

               Step 2 Assign weights to each key external and internal factor. These weights are identi-
                      cal to those in the EFE Matrix and IFE Matrix. The weights are presented in a straight
                      column just to the right of the external and internal factors.
               Step 3 Examine the Stage 2 (matching) matrices, and identify alternative strategies that the
                      organization should consider implementing. Record these strategies in the top row of
                      the QSPM, perhaps selecting two or more of your SO, WO, ST, and/or WT strategies.
               Step 4 Determine the Attractiveness Scores (AS), defined as numerical values that indicate
                      the relative attractiveness of each strategy considering a single external or internal
                      factor. Attractiveness Scores (AS) are determined by examining each key external
                      or internal factor, one at a time, and asking the question, “Does this factor affect the
                      choice of strategies being made?” If the answer to this question is yes, then the strate-
                      gies should be compared relative to that key factor. Specifically, AS should be assigned
                      to each strategy to indicate the relative attractiveness of one strategy over others,
                      considering the particular factor. The range for AS is 1 = not attractive, 2 = somewhat
                      attractive, 3 = reasonably attractive, and 4 = highly attractive. By “attractive,” we
                      mean the extent that one strategy, compared to others, enables the firm to either capi-
                      talize on the strength, improve on the weakness, exploit the opportunity, or avoid the
                      threat. Work row by row in developing a QSPM. If the answer to the previous question
                      is no, indicating the respective key factor has no effect on the specific choice being
                      made, then do not assign AS to the strategies in that set. Use a dash (or 0 if using the
                      template) to indicate that the key factor does not affect the choice being made. Note:
                      If you assign an AS score to one strategy, then assign an AS score(s) to the other—in
                      other words, if one strategy receives a dash (or 0)—then all others must receive a dash
                      (or 0) in a given row.
               Step 5 Compute the Total Attractiveness Scores. Total Attractiveness Scores (TAS) are
                      defined as the product of multiplying the weights (Step 2) by the AS (Step 4) in each
                      row. The TAS indicate the relative attractiveness of each alternative strategy, consid-
                      ering only the impact of the adjacent external or internal critical success factor. The
                      higher the TAS, the more attractive the strategic alternative (considering only the
                      adjacent critical success factor).
               Step 6 Compute the Sum Total Attractiveness Score. Add TAS in each strategy column
                      of the QSPM. The Sum Total Attractiveness Scores (STAS) reveal which strategy
                      is most attractive in each set of alternatives. Higher scores indicate more attractive
                      strategies, considering all the relevant external and internal factors that could affect the
                      strategic decisions. The magnitude of the difference between the STAS in a given set
                      of strategic alternatives indicates the relative desirability of one strategy over another.
                    In Table 6-5, two alternative strategies—(1) buy new land and build new larger store and
               (2) fully renovate existing store—are being considered by a computer retail store. Note by the
               STAS’s of 3.64 versus 3.27 that the analysis indicates the business should buy new land and
               build a new larger store. Note the use of dashes to indicate which factors do not affect the strat-
               egy choice being considered. If a particular factor affects one strategy, but not the other, it affects
               the choice being made, so AS scores should be recorded for both strategies. Never rate one strat-
               egy and not the other. Note also in Table 6-5 that there are no consecutive 1s, 2s, 3s, or 4s across
               any row in a QSPM; never assign the same AS score across a row. Always prepare a QSPM
               working row by row. Also, if you have more than four strategies in the QSPM, then let the AS
               scores range from 1 to “the number of strategies being evaluated.” This will enable you to have a
               different AS score for each strategy. These are all important guidelines to follow in developing a
               QSPM. In actual practice, the store did purchase the new land and build a new store; the business
               also did some minor refurbishing until the new store was operational.
                    There should be a rationale for each AS score assigned. Note in the first row of Table 6-5 that
               the “Population of city growing 10 percent” opportunity could be capitalized on best by Strategy
               1, “Buy New Land and Build New, Larger Store,” so an AS score of 4 was assigned to Strategy
               1. Attractiveness Scores, therefore, are not mere guesses; they should be rational, defensible, and
               reasonable. Mathematically, the AS score of 4 in row 1 suggests Strategy 1 is 100 percent more at-
               tractive than Strategy 2, whose AS score was 2 (since 4 - 2 = 2 and 2 divided by 2 = 100 percent).

                                           Positive Features and Limitations of the QSPM
                                           A positive feature of the QSPM is that sets of strategies can be examined sequentially or simul-
                                           taneously. For example, corporate-level strategies could be evaluated first, followed by division-
                                           level strategies, and then function-level strategies. There is no limit to the number of strategies that
                                           can be evaluated or the number of sets of strategies that can be examined at once using the QSPM.
                                                Another positive feature of the QSPM is that it requires strategists to integrate pertinent ex-
                                           ternal and internal factors into the decision process. Developing a QSPM makes it less likely that
                                           key factors will be overlooked or weighted inappropriately. It draws attention to important re-
                                           lationships that affect strategic decisions. Although developing a QSPM requires Attractiveness
                                           Scores (AS) decisions, those small decisions enhance the probability that the final strategic deci-
                                           sions will be best for the organization. A QSPM can be used by small and large, for-profit and
                                           nonprofit organizations, and even can be used by individuals in making career choices.6
                                                The QSPM has two limitations. First, it always requires informed judgments regarding AS
                                           scores, but quantification is helpful throughout the strategic-planning process to minimize halo
                                           error and various biases. Attractiveness Scores are not mere guesses. Be reminded that a 4 is
                                           33 percent more important than a 3; making informed small decisions is important for mak-
                                           ing effective big decisions, such as deciding among various strategies to implement. Second, a
                                           limitation of the QSPM is that its factors and strategy choices are based on underlying input and
                                           matching matrices/analysis.

                                           with Recommendations
                                           The SWOT, BCG, IE, SPACE, and GRAND matrices are used in strategic planning to generate
                                           feasible alternative strategies that could benefit the firm. The term recommendation is used to re-
                                           fer to “any alternative strategy that is selected for implementation.” Due to monetary and/or non-
                                           monetary constraints, no firm can implement all alternative strategies proposed in the matching
                                           matrices, so firms utilize the QSPM and expert judgment to select particular strategies. Perhaps the

               most important page in a student’s strategic planning case project is his/her Recommendations
               Page—a page where recommendations are listed along with an estimated dollar amount for the
               expected cost (or savings) of each recommendation over the next three years. The dollar amounts
               should all be added to reveal a total amount of new capital needed over the three years.
                    As indicated in Global Capsule 6, India is a country where many companies are building a
               new manufacturing plant due to that country’s flourishing economy. So, how much does it cost
               to build a manufacturing plant? Guidance is given in Table 6.6 for determining the estimated
               cost (or savings) of various recommendations. Table 6.6 gives six example actions that could be
               recommendations for a firm, along with a rationale and author comment for how dollar values
               can be estimated on a recommendations page. As indicated, a cost per square foot approach may
               be used to estimate the total cost of building manufacturing plants, retail stores, distribution cen-
               ters, or warehouses. Another way to estimate various costs is to find costs incurred for similar
               expenditures by other firms. Also, look in the firm’s Form 10K because costs are often given for
               previous expenditures, and these dollar values can give guidance for estimating costs associated
               with new recommendations. Avoid wild cost guesses; ask “experts” in the field if needed.

               TABLE 6-6 Recommendations and Associated Costs with Rationale
                   Recommendation with Total Cost Rationale

                     1. Build one new manufacturing plant. $40M = $400 per sq. ft. : 100K sq. ft. = $40M
                        Author Comment - Depending on the size of the plant, cost of the land, and complex-
                        ity of the plant, the dollar amount could be higher or lower. Oftentimes a Form 10K will
                        reveal the actual cost of a similar plant recently built. Another way to estimate this cost
                        is to divide the firm’s total property, plant, and equipment on their balance sheet by the
                        number of manufacturing plants to get an average for one and use this as a basis for the
                        cost of building a new plant. A good rule of thumb is to spread the cost of building a new
                        manufacturing plant over two years.
                     2. Open 200 new retail stores. $300M = 200 stores : 10K sq. ft. per store : $150 per sq.
                        ft = $300M.
                        Author Comment - Depending on the average store size and cost of land, the dollar
                        amount could be higher or lower. Another way to estimate this cost is to divide the firm’s
                        total property, plant, and equipment on their balance sheet by the number of existing
                        stores to get an average for one store and use this as a basis for opening 200 new stores.
                        Be mindful that many firms use a franchise instead of a company-owned business model,
                        whereby most costs are borne by the franchisee; also, many firms lease instead of own
                        retail space. If the 200 new stores are to come online over 3 years, spread the total cost
                        over 3 years.
                     3. Hire 100 new salespersons. $7.5M = 100 : $75K annual pay = $7.5M
                        Author Comment - The cost could be higher or lower depending on the average salary
                        plus commission and amenities to be paid to salespersons in a given industry.
                     4. Divest our fragrance division. $59.4M fragrance segment comprises 27% of firm’s rev-
                        enues; total corporate value of firm is $640M. So 27% : $640M = $59.4M (revenue).
                        Author Comment - Besides going into debt, issuing stock, or using net income, a way to
                        raise needed funds is to divest of a segment. Divestiture may be needed if the segment is
                        performing poorly, or if the firm desires to become less diversified, or if the firm needs
                        to realign its portfolio of businesses with its new or existing mission statement.
                     5. Increase R&D expenditures. $66.2M current R&D annual expenditures10% annually.
                        ($200M) : 10% increase annually = $20M + $22M + $24.2M = $66.2M
                        Author Comment - As a percent of revenue, R&D expenditures can range from zero for
                        low-tech firms to upwards of 20% of revenue for hi-tech firms.
                     6. Acquire the jewelry segment. $225M jewelry segment comprises 15% of XYZ com-
                        pany. Rival firm’s revenues; total value of rival firm is $1.5B. So 15% of $1.5B =
                        $225M estimate.
                        Author Comment - Firms need to show 5+ percent annual growth in revenues to keep
                        shareholders pleased. An acquisition is widely used to achieve this need, especially if
                        internal (organic) growth is not sufficient.

    216    PART 2 • STRATEGY FORMULATION

                             LO 6.10   Cultural Aspects of Strategy Analysis and Choice
                                       As defined in Chapter 4, organizational culture includes the set of shared values, beliefs, at-
                                       titudes, customs, norms, rites, rituals, personalities, heroes, and heroines that describe a firm.
                                       Culture is the unique way an organization does business. It is the human dimension that creates
                                       solidarity and meaning, and it inspires commitment and productivity in an organization when
                                       strategy changes are made. All human beings have a basic need to make sense of the world, to
                                       feel in control, and to make meaning. When events threaten meaning, individuals react defen-
                                       sively. Managers and employees may even sabotage new strategies in an effort to recapture the
                                       status quo. For these reasons, it is beneficial to view strategy analysis and choice from a cultural
                                       perspective, because success often rests on the degree of support that strategies receive from a
                                       firm’s culture. If a firm’s strategies are supported by an organization’s culture, then managers
                                       often can implement changes swiftly and easily. However, if a supportive culture does not exist
                                       and is not cultivated, then strategy changes may be difficult to implement.
                                            Strategies that require fewer cultural changes may be more attractive because extensive
                                       changes can take considerable time and effort. Whenever two firms merge, it becomes especially
                                       important to evaluate and consider culture-strategy linkages. Organizational culture can be the
                                       primary reason for difficulties a firm encounters when it attempts to shift its strategic direction,
                                       as the following statement explains:

                                          Not only has the “right” corporate culture become the essence and foundation of corporate
                                          excellence, but success or failure of needed corporate reforms hinges on management’s
                                          sagacity and ability to change the firm’s driving culture in time and in tune with required
                                          changes in strategies.7



                            LO 6.11    The Politics of Strategy Analysis and Choice
                                       All organizations are political. Unless managed, political maneuvering consumes valuable
                                       time, subverts organizational objectives, diverts human energy, and results in the loss of some
                                       valuable employees. Sometimes political biases and personal preferences get unduly embedded
                                       in strategy choice decisions. Internal politics affect the choice of strategies in all organizations.
                                       The hierarchy of command in an organization, combined with the career aspirations of different
                                       people and the need to allocate scarce resources, guarantees the formation of coalitions of indi-
                                       viduals who strive to take care of themselves first and the organization second, third, or fourth.
                                       Coalitions of individuals often form around key strategic issues that face an enterprise. A major
                                       responsibility of strategists is to guide the development of coalitions, to nurture an overall team
                                       concept, and to gain the support of key individuals and groups of individuals.
                                            In the absence of objective analyses, strategy decisions too often are based on the politics
                                       of the moment. With the development of improved strategy-formation analytical tools, political
                                       factors become less important in making strategic decisions. In the absence of objectivity, politi-
                                       cal factors sometimes dictate strategies, and this is unfortunate. Managing political relationships
                                       is an integral part of building enthusiasm and esprit de corps in an organization.
                                            A classic study of strategic management in nine large corporations examined the political
                                       tactics of successful strategists and found that these persons let weakly supported ideas and
                                       proposals die through inaction and to establish additional hurdles or tests for strongly supported
                                       ideas considered unacceptable, but not openly opposed.8 Successful strategists keep a low politi-
                                       cal profile on unacceptable proposals and strive to let most negative decisions come from subor-
                                       dinates or a group consensus, thereby reserving their personal vetoes for big issues and crucial
                                       moments. Successful strategists do a lot of chatting and informal questioning to stay abreast of
                                       how things were progressing and to know when to intervene. Successful strategists lead strategy
                                       but do not dictate it. They give few orders, announce few decisions, depend heavily on informal
                                       questioning, and seek to probe and clarify until a consensus emerged.
                                            Successful strategists generously and visibly reward key thrusts that succeeded. They assign
                                       responsibility for major new thrusts to champions, the individuals most strongly identified with
                                       the idea or product and whose futures were linked to its success. They stay alert to the symbolic
                                       impact of their own actions and statements so as not to send false signals that could stimulate
                                       movements in unwanted directions.

                  Because strategies must be effective in the marketplace and capable of gaining internal
               commitment, the following tactics used by politicians for centuries can aid strategists:
                   1. Achieving desired results is more important than imposing a particular method; therefore,
                      consider various methods and choose, whenever possible, the one(s) that will afford the
                      greatest commitment from employees/managers.
                   2. Achieving satisfactory results with a popular strategy is generally better than trying to
                      achieve optimal results with an unpopular strategy.

                                          Chapter Summary
                                          The essence of strategy formulation is an assessment of whether an organization is doing the
                                          right things and how it can be more effective in what it does. Every organization should be wary
                                          of becoming a prisoner of its own strategy, for even the best strategies become obsolete sooner
                                          or later. Regular reappraisal of strategy helps management avoid complacency. Objectives and
                                          strategies should be consciously developed and coordinated and should not merely evolve out of
                                          day-to-day operating decisions.
                                               An organization with no sense of direction and no coherent strategy precipitates its own
                                          demise. When an organization does not know where it wants to go, it usually ends up someplace
                                          it does not want to be. Every organization needs to consciously establish and communicate clear
                                          objectives and strategies. Any organization, whether military, product-oriented, service-oriented,
                                          governmental, or even athletic, must develop and execute effective strategies to win. An excel-
                                          lent offense without an excellent defense, or vice versa, usually leads to defeat. Developing
                                          strategies that use strengths to capitalize on opportunities could be considered offensive, whereas
                                          strategies designed to improve on weaknesses while avoiding threats could be termed defensive.
                                          Every organization has numerous external opportunities and threats and internal strengths and
                                          weaknesses that can be aligned to formulate feasible alternative strategies.
                                               Modern strategy-formulation tools and concepts described in this chapter are integrated
                                          into a practical three-stage framework. Tools such as the SWOT Matrix, SPACE Matrix, BCG
                                          Matrix, IE Matrix, and QSPM can significantly enhance the quality of strategic decisions, but
                                          they should never be used to dictate the choice of strategies. Behavioral, cultural, and politi-
                                          cal aspects of strategy generation and selection are always important to consider and manage.
                                          Because of increased legal pressure from outside groups, boards of directors are assuming a
                                          more active role in strategy analysis and choice. This is a positive trend for organizations.

                              Perform a SWOT Analysis for Coca-Cola
               Purpose
               The SWOT Matrix is the most widely used of all strategic planning tools and techniques because
               it is conceptually simple and lends itself readily to discussion among executives and managers.
               The SWOT Matrix is effective in formulating strategies because it clearly matches a firm’s internal
               strengths and weaknesses with the firm’s external opportunities and threats to generate feasible strate-
               gies that should be considered. This exercise gives you practice in performing SWOT analysis for a
               large corporation.
               Instructions
               Step 1             Join with two other students in class. Together, develop a SWOT Matrix for Coca-Cola.
                                  Follow guidelines provided in the chapter, including notation (for example, S4, T3) at the
                                  end of each strategy. Include two strategies in each of the four (SO, ST, WT, WO) quadrants.
                                  Be specific regarding your strategies, avoiding generic terms such as forward integration.
                                  Use the Cohesion Case, your answers to Assurance-of-Learning Exercise 1B on page 66,
                                  and the company’s most recent quarterly report as given at the corporate website.
               Step 2             Turn in your team-developed SWOT Matrix to your professor for a classwork grade. Note:
                                  Feel free to list factors and strategies vertically on a page rather than necessarily fitting ev-

                              Develop a SPACE Matrix for Coca-Cola
               Purpose
               The SPACE Matrix is one of five matching strategic management tools widely used to formulate
               feasible strategies. Used in conjunction with the SWOT, BCG, IE, and GRAND, the SPACE can be
               helpful in devising a strategic plan because hard choices normally must be made between attractive
               strategic options. This exercise gives you practice in developing a SPACE Matrix.
               Instructions
               Step 1             Review Coca-Cola’s business as described in the Cohesion Case as well as the company’s
                                  most recent Form 10K and quarterly report.
               Step 2             Review industry and competitive information pertaining to Coca-Cola.
               Step 3             Develop a SPACE Matrix for Coca-Cola. What strategies do you recommend for Coca-Cola
                                  given your SPACE analysis? Avoid generic, vague terms such as market development.

                                                 Develop a BCG Matrix for Coca-Cola
                                  Purpose
                                  Portfolio matrices are widely used by multidivisional organizations to help identify and select strate-
                                  gies to pursue. A BCG analysis identifies particular divisions that should receive fewer resources than
                                  others. It may identify some divisions that need to be divested. This exercise can give you practice in
                                  developing a BCG Matrix.
                                  Instructions
                                  Step 1         Place the following five column headings at the top of a separate sheet of paper: Divisions,
                                                 Revenues, Profits, Relative Market Share Position, Industry Growth Rate. Down the far
                                                 left of your page, list Coca-Cola’s divisions/segments as given on pages 58–59. Now turn
                                                 back to the Cohesion Case and find information to fill in all the cells in your data table from
                                                 page 59.
                                  Step 2         Based on Coca-Cola’s year-end 2017 segment data given in the Cohesion Case, complete a
                                                 BCG Matrix for the company.
                                  Step 3         Compare your BCG Matrix to other students’ matrices. Discuss any major differences.

                                  This exercise can give you practice in developing a QSPM to determine the relative attractiveness of
                                  various strategic alternatives.
                                  Instructions

                                  Developing a BCG Matrix for many nonprofit organizations, including colleges and universities,
                                  is a useful exercise. Of course, there are no profits for each division or department—and in some
                                  cases no revenues. However, be creative in performing a BCG Matrix. For example, the pie slice
                                  in the circles can represent the number of majors receiving jobs on graduation, or the number
                                  of faculty teaching in that area, or some other variable that you believe is important to consider.
                                  The size of the circles can represent the number of students majoring in particular departments or
                                  areas.

                                  Step 1         Develop a BCG Matrix for your university. Include all academic schools, departments, or
                                                 colleges.
                                  Step 2         Diagram your BCG Matrix on paper.
                                  Step 3         Discuss differences among the BCG Matrices developed in class.

               SET 3: STRATEGIC PLANNING TO ENHANCE MY EMPLOYABILITY
               EXERCISE 6F
               Perform QSPM Analysis on Myself
               Purpose
               QSPM analysis is designed to determine the relative attractiveness of feasible alternative actions.
               Although primarily used in a business setting, QSPM analysis can enable individuals to objectively
               determine which alternative strategies are best to pursue. The purpose of this exercise is to showcase
               how individuals can use QSPM analysis to make career choices.
               Instructions
               Step 1          Follow the steps provided in Chapter 6 for developing a QSPM analysis, but do so for your-
                               self rather than a company. Use the external and internal factor information about yourself
                               that you earlier developed in Exercise 1D (p. 67) to get started.
               Step 2          Across the top row of your QSPM, consider two strategies as follows:
                               1) Go to graduate school or 2) Go to work full-time.
               Step 3          To keep this example simple, do not include a weight column, as some firms also prefer;
                               simply add the AS scores to obtain your recommended best strategy, rather than multiplying
                               across rows and summing TAS scores.
               Step 4          Share with the class what strategy, More School or More Work, yields the highest TAS score
                               in your personal analysis.

               EXERCISE 6G

               A Template Competency Test
               Purpose
               The free Excel strategic planning template at www.strategyclub.com is widely used for strategic
               planning by students and small businesses; this exercise aims to enhance your familiarity with the
               template. Developing competence with the template will enable you to place this skill appropriately
               on your resume, in addition to facilitating your development of a comprehensive strategic plan for an
               assigned case company.
               Instructions
               Answer the following Chapter 6 related questions about the template. Discuss your answers with
               classmates to determine any issues or concerns.
                   1. In performing SPACE analysis, does the template allow you to show your firm and rival firms?
                      If yes, would a legend be nice to create to organize information? Why?
                   2. In performing BCG analysis, how does the template address firms competing in markets with
                      over or under 20% IGR?
                   3. Using the template, what is a good way to show a before and after (your recommendations)
                      BCG?
                   4. In performing IE portfolio analysis using the template, are your EFE and IFE Matrix total
                      weighted scores automatically plotted after you finish those matrices? For divisions, does the
                      template call for all “divisional” EFE and IFE matrices?
                   5. Why is it best to label divisions 1, 2, 3 etc. on BCG and IE matrices and thereby create a legend,
                      rather than let division names plot in the matrix?
                   6. In performing GRAND analysis, how many firms/divisions/scenarios does the template allow
                      to be considered/placed in the matrix? Why is this a nice feature? What are some scenarios you
                      could examine?
                   7. Why is there no need to reenter weights when performing QSPM analysis using the template?

                                  SET 4: INDIVIDUAL VERSUS GROUP STRATEGIC PLANNING

                                  EXERCISE 6H

                                  How Severe Are Various Subjective Threats in
                                  Strategic Planning?
                                  Purpose
                                  As discussed in Chapter 6, without objective information and analysis, six subjective threats (per-
                                  sonal biases, politics, prejudices, emotions, personalities, and halo error) oftentimes play a dominant
                                  role in the strategy-formulation process, undermining effectiveness. Halo error is the tendency to put
                                  too much weight on a single factor.
                                      The purpose of this exercise is to examine more closely various threats of relying too heavily on
                                  subjectivity in formulating strategies. A secondary purpose of this exercise is to examine whether
                                  individual decision making is better than group decision making. Academic research suggests that
                                  groups make better decisions than individuals about 80 percent of the time.
                                  Instructions
                                  Rank the six subjective threats as to their relative severity (1 = most severe, 9 = least important). First,
                                  rank the threats as an individual. Next, rank the threats as part of a group of three. Thus, determine what
                                  person(s) and what group(s) here today can come closest to the expert ranking. This exercise enables
                                  examination of the relative effectiveness of individual versus group decision making in strategic planning.
                                  The Steps
                                   1. Fill in Column 1 in Table 6-7 to reveal your individual ranking of the relative severity of the six
                                      subjective threats (1= most severe to 6 = least severe). For example, if you think Personal Biases
                                      is the third-most severe threat, then enter a 3 in Table 6-7 in Column 1 beside Personal Biases.
                                   2. Fill in Column 2 in Table 6-7 to reveal your group’s ranking of the relative severity of the six
                                      threats (1 = most severe to 6 = least severe).
                                   3. Fill in Column 3 in Table 6-7 to reveal the expert’s ranking of the six threats. To be provided by
                                      your professor, the expert rankings are based on the authors’ experience, rather than on findings
                                      from empirical research.
                                   4. Fill in Column 4 in Table 6-7 to reveal the absolute difference between Column 1 and Column 3
                                      to reveal how well you performed as an individual in this exercise. (Note: Absolute difference
                                      disregards negative numbers.)
                                   5. Fill in Column 5 in Table 6-7 to reveal the absolute difference between Column 2 and Column 3
                                      to reveal how well your group performed in this exercise.
                                   6. Sum Column 4. Sum Column 5.
                                   7. Compare the Column 4 sum with the Column 5 sum. If your Column 4 sum is less than your
                                      Column 5 sum, then you performed better as an individual than as a group. Normally, group
                                      decision making is superior to individual decision making, so if you did better than your group,
                                      you did excellent.
                                   8. The Individual Winner(s): The individual(s) with the lowest Column 4 sum is the WINNER.
                                   9. The Group Winners(s): The group(s) with the lowest Column 5 score is the WINNER.

               MOST COMPANIES DO STRATEGIC
               PLANNING?
               The answer to the question posed above might be the Boston Consulting Group (BCG) headquartered
               in Boston, Massachusetts. A worldwide management-consulting firm founded in 1963, BCG had rev-
               enues of $6.3 billion in 2017 and more than 16,000 employees. BCG’s President and CEO is Rich
               Lesser. BCG was ranked third among Fortune’s “100 Best Companies to Work For” in 2017 and was What Are Your Thoughts on
               ranked first among Consulting Magazine’s 2016 “Best Firms to Work For.”                              This Idea?
                   In formulating strategies, some firms use BCG’s Advantage Matrix to portray on the x-axis the
               “size of a firm’s competitive advantage (Low versus High)” and on the y-axis “the number of ap-
               proaches a firm can use to achieve competitive advantage (Low versus High).” Based on these two
               axes, strategic implications for firms located in one of four quadrants can be labeled, according to
               BCG, as: Fragmented, Specialization, Volume, and Stalemate, as illustrated below:

                                                                             High

                                                                                    High                                             Low
                                                                                           Size of a Firm’s Competitive Advantage


               Do some online research to answer the following questions about BCG’s Advantage Matrix.

               Questions
                1. In a sentence or two for each quadrant, how would you describe implications for a firm based on
                   their position in the Advantage Matrix? Do you like the four words proposed for “quadrant im-
                   plications?” Can you think of a better word or words?
                2. What do you think are the primary benefits of using the Advantage Matrix?
                3. What are the primary limitations of using the Advantage Matrix in your view?
                4. How could the Advantage Matrix be improved?

                                           T
                                                   he strategic-management process does not end with deciding what strategy or strategies
                                                   to pursue. There must be a translation of strategic thought into action. This translation is
                                                   significantly easier when managers and employees of the firm understand the business,
                                            feel a part of the company, and through involvement in strategy-formulation activities have be-
                                            come committed to helping the organization succeed. Without understanding and commitment,
                                            strategy-implementation efforts face major problems. Vince Lombardi commented, “The best
                                            game plan in the world never blocked or tackled anybody.”

                                               Even the most technically perfect strategic plan will serve little purpose if it is not
                                               implemented. Many organizations tend to spend an inordinate amount of time, money,
                                               and effort on developing the strategic plan, all the while treating the means and circum-
                                               stances under which it will be implemented as afterthoughts! Change comes through

                                               is implemented well will achieve more than a perfect plan that never gets off the paper

    PepsiCo
    The former CEO of PepsiCo, Indra Nooyi, was voted Fortune’s second-
    most powerful woman in business in the U.S. in 2017. Former CEO
    Nooyi has appeared 18 out of the last 20 years on Fortune’s list of the
    50 most-admired businesswomen in the U.S. Nooyi has catapulted
    PepsiCo to currently have 22 brands that each bring in more than $1
    billion in annual sales; three new PepsiCo brands (Naked Juice, $923M;
    Pure Leaf, $873M; and Sabra, $618M) are poised to soon join the com-
    pany’s over $1 billion brand list. In a recent interview, Nooyi answered a
    few strategy implementation questions (condensed and paraphrased):
                                                                                      Answer: Strive to get increasingly better at multitasking.

          porter. What do you think about political issues in terms of
          strategy implementation?                                                    forward to the next day’s list any item that still needs work;
          Answer: Before a presidential election, you can support any                 continually develop your business skills by prioritizing tasks
          candidate you like, but the day after the election, support                 that need to be done. I personally do all these things daily

               trated with white shading in Figure 7-1 on the first page of this chapter. Successful
               strategy formulation does not guarantee successful strategy implementation. It is             Position forces        Manage forces
               always more difficult to do something (strategy implementation) than to say you are          before the action      during the action
               going to do it (strategy formulation)! Although inextricably linked, strategy imple-
               mentation is fundamentally different from strategy formulation.

               shift in responsibility, especially if strategy-formulation decisions come as a surprise

               This is a primary reason why divisional and functional managers should be involved
               as much as possible in both strategy-formulation and strategy-implementation activi-

               Annual objectives are desired milestones an organization should achieve to ensure
               successful strategy implementation. Annual objectives are essential for strategy             Process-oriented        People-oriented
               implementation for five primary reasons:
                   1. They represent the basis for allocating resources.

                   2. They are a primary mechanism for evaluating managers.                                      Primary
                                                                                                                                   responsibility of

                   4. They establish organizational, divisional, and departmental priorities.
                   5. They are essential for keeping a strategic plan on track.
                                                                                                          FIGURE 7-2
                    Considerable time and effort should be devoted to ensuring that annual objec-         Contrasting Strategy Formulation
               tives are well conceived, consistent with long-term objectives, and supportive of          with Strategy Implementation
               strategies to be implemented. Active participation in establishing annual objectives
               is needed for the preceding reasons listed. Approving, revising, or rejecting annual
               objectives is much more than a rubber-stamp activity. The purpose of annual objec-
               tives can be summarized as follows:                                                                       LO 7.2

                    Annual objectives serve as guidelines for action, directing, and channeling efforts and ac-
                    tivities of organization members. They provide a source of legitimacy in an enterprise by
                    justifying activities to stakeholders. They serve as standards of performance. They serve
                    as an important source of employee motivation and identification. They give incentives for
                    managers and employees to perform. They provide a basis for organizational design.2

                    Clearly stated and communicated objectives are critical to success in all types and sizes
               of firms. Annual objectives are often stated in terms of profitability, growth, and market share

                                          by business segment, geographic area, customer group, and product. Figure 7-3 illustrates how
                                          the Stamus Company could establish annual objectives based on long-term objectives. Table 7-1
                                          reveals associated revenue figures that correspond to the objectives outlined in Figure 7-3. Note
                                          that, according to plan, the Stamus Company will slightly exceed its long-term objective of
                                          doubling company revenues between 2020 and 2022. Figure 7-3 also reflects how a hierarchy of
                                          annual objectives can be established based on an organization’s structure.

                     Objectives should be consistent across both horizontal (functional/departmental/staff) and
               vertical (top to lower managers) levels in a chain of command. Horizontal consistency of
               ­objectives, such as pertaining to a CFO, CMO, CIO, CSO, or HRM laterally across a chart, is as
                important as vertical consistency of objectives, such as pertaining to a Chairperson, CEO, divi-
                sion president, or plant manager downward in a chart.
                     Annual objectives should be measurable, consistent, reasonable, challenging, clear, com-
                municated throughout the organization, characterized by an appropriate time dimension, and
                accompanied by commensurate rewards and sanctions. These elements are often called the
                characteristics of objectives. Too often, objectives are stated in generalities, with little opera-
                tional usefulness. Annual objectives, such as “to improve communication” or “to improve per-
                formance,” are not clear, specific, or measurable. Objectives should state quantity, quality, cost,
                and time—and also be verifiable. Terms and phrases such as maximize, minimize, as soon as
                possible, and adequate should be avoided. For example, an annual objective could be “increase
                sales of brand ABC to 1,000 units yielding $20,000 in revenue annually.”
                     Annual objectives should be supported by clearly stated policies. It is important to tie
                rewards and sanctions to annual objectives so that employees and managers understand that
                achieving objectives is critical to successful strategy implementation. Clear annual objectives
                do not guarantee successful strategy implementation, but they do increase the likelihood that
                personal and organizational aims can be accomplished. Overemphasis on achieving objectives
                can result in undesirable conduct, such as faking the numbers, distorting the records, and letting
                objectives become ends in themselves. Wells Fargo had a probem with this a few years ago in
                regards to employees opening new customer accounts.
                     Based on management activities such as establishing clear annual objectives, Fortune an-
                nually ranks companies as the most admired in the world; its recent ranking is revealed in Table
                7-2. Note that the top 10 firms are U.S. companies, but three outside-U.S.-headquartered compa-
                nies made the top 35: BMW (#14), Singapore Airlines (#33), and Toyota Motor (#34).

               Policies refer to specific guidelines, methods, procedures, rules, forms, and administrative prac-
               tices established to support and encourage work toward stated goals. Changes in a firm’s stra-
               tegic direction do not occur automatically. On a day-to-day basis, policies are needed to make
               a strategy work. Policies facilitate solving recurring problems and guide the implementation of
               strategy. Policies are essential instruments for strategy implementation, for at least six reasons:
                   1. Policies set boundaries, constraints, and limits on the kinds of administrative actions that
                      can be taken to reward and sanction behavior.
                   2. Policies let both employees and managers know what is expected of them, thereby increas-
                      ing the likelihood that strategies will be implemented successfully.

                                   3. Policies provide a basis for management control and allow coordination across organiza-
                                      tional units.
                                   4. Policies reduce the amount of time managers spend making decisions. Policies also clarify
                                      what work is to be done and by whom.
                                   5. Policies promote delegation of decision making to appropriate managerial levels where
                                      various problems usually arise.
                                   6. Policies clarify what can and cannot be done in pursuit of an organization’s objectives.

                                       As an example policy, more and more companies, including IBM, Aetna, Bank of America,
                                  Best Buy, and Reddit, are abandoning the idea of allowing employees to work from home.
                                  Businesses are finding there is need for more collaboration at the work site, closer contact with
                                  customers, and more control of the workday. Research reveals that the percentage of U.S. work-
                                  ers who performed all or some of their work at home fell to less than 20 percent in 2017, down
                                  from 24 percent the prior year.3 Commuting to work, teamwork, and working in cubicles at
                                  company-owned office spaces is on the rise, while staying at a home office to work remotely is
                                  becoming less common.
                                       Many organizations have a policy manual that serves to guide and direct behavior.
                                  Policies can apply to all divisions and departments, such as: “We are an equal opportunity
                                  employer,” or to a single department, such as: “Employees in this department must take
                                  at least one training and development course each year.” Whatever their scope and form,
                                  policies serve as a mechanism for implementing strategies and obtaining objectives. Policies
                                  should be stated in writing whenever possible. They represent the means for carrying out
                                  strategic decisions.
                                       Examples of policies that support a company strategy, a divisional objective, and a depart-
                                  mental objective are given in Table 7-3. Some example issues that may require a management
                                  policy are provided in Table 7-4. As discussed in Ethics Capsule 7, there is an increasing need
                                  for firms to establish policies regarding employees’ use of personal smartphones at work, as dis-
                                  tractions caused by such behavior can undermine employee morale.

               Allocate Resources and Manage Conflict                                                                                    LO 7.4
               Allocate Resources
               All organizations have at least four types of resources (or assets) that can be used to achieve
               desired objectives: (1) financial resources, (2) physical resources, (3) human resources, and (4)
               technological resources. Resource allocation can be defined as distributing an organization’s
               “assets” across products, regions, and segments according to priorities established by annual ob-
               jectives. Allocating resources is a vital strategy-implementation activity. Strategic management
               itself is sometimes referred to as a resource-allocation process. In fact, allocating resources
               across business segments (divisions) is arguably the most important strategic decision facing
               large companies annually.
                    In organizations that do no strategic planning, resource allocation is often based on political or
               personal factors and bias, rather than on clear analysis and thought. Strategists should be wary of a
               number of factors that commonly prohibit effective resource allocation, including overprotection of
               resources, too great an emphasis on short-run financial criteria, organizational politics, vague strat-
               egy targets, a reluctance to take risks, and a lack of sufficient knowledge. Below the corporate level,
               there often exists an absence of systematic thinking about resources allocated and strategies of the
               firm. Effective resource allocation does not guarantee successful strategy implementation because
               programs, personnel, controls, and commitment must breathe life into the resources provided.

                                           Manage Conflict
                                           Honest differences of opinion, turf protection, and competition for limited resources can
                                           inevitably lead to conflict. Conflict can be defined as a disagreement between two or more
                                           parties on one or more issues. Establishing annual objectives can lead to conflict because
                                           individuals have different expectations, perceptions, schedules, pressures, obligations, and
                                           personalities. Misunderstandings between line managers (such as production supervisors)
                                           and staff managers (such as human resource specialists) can occur. For example, a collection
                                           manager’s objective of reducing bad debts by 50 percent in a given year may conflict with a
                                           divisional objective to increase sales by 20 percent. Conflict must be managed for strategy
                                           implementation to be successful. Managing conflict is a strategic issue in most, if not all,
                                           organizations.
                                                Establishing objectives can lead to conflict because managers and strategists must make
                                           tradeoffs, such as whether to emphasize short-term profits or long-term growth, profit margin
                                           or market share, market penetration or market development, growth or stability, high risk or low
                                           risk, and social responsiveness or profit maximization. Tradeoffs are necessary because no firm
                                           has sufficient resources to pursue all strategies that would benefit the firm. Table 7-5 reveals
                                           some important management trade-off decisions required in strategy implementation. Strategic
                                           planning necessitates making effective trade-off decisions.
                                                Conflict is not always bad. An absence of conflict can signal indifference and apathy. Conflict
                                           can serve to energize opposing groups into action and may help managers identify problems.
                                           General George Patton once said, “If everyone is thinking alike, then somebody isn’t thinking.”
                                                Various approaches for managing and resolving conflict range from ignoring the problem in
                                           hopes that the conflict will resolve itself or physically separating the conflicting individuals, to
                                           compromising, to exchanging members of conflicting parties so that each can gain an apprecia-
                                           tion of the other’s point of view, or even holding a meeting at which conflicting parties present
                                           their views and work through their differences.


                                  LO 7.5   Match Structure with Strategy
                                           Disney restructured in 2018 to add a direct-to-consumer segment and an international division.
                                           With the restructuring, Disney combined its consumer products and theme parks divisions.
                                           Alfred Chandler promoted the notion that “changes in strategy lead to changes in organizational
                                           structure.” Structure should be designed to facilitate the strategic pursuit of a firm and, therefore,
                                           follow strategy. Without a strategy or reasons for being (mission), companies find it difficult to
                                           design an effective structure.
                                                Changes in strategy often require changes in structure for two major reasons. First, structure
                                           largely dictates how objectives and policies will be established. For example, objectives and pol-
                                           icies established under a geographic organizational structure are couched in geographic terms.
                                           Objectives and policies are stated largely in terms of products in an organization whose structure

               is based on product groups. The structural format for developing objectives and policies can sig-
               nificantly impact all other strategy-implementation activities.
                    The second major reason why changes in strategy often require changes in structure is that
               structure dictates how resources will be allocated. If an organization’s structure is based on cus-
               tomer groups, then resources are allocated in that manner. Similarly, if an organization’s struc-
               ture is set up along functional business lines, then resources are allocated by functional areas.
               Unless new or revised strategies place emphasis in the same areas as old strategies, structural
               reorientation commonly becomes a part of strategy implementation.
                    When a firm changes its strategy, the existing organizational structure may become ineffec-
               tive. As indicated in Table 7-6, symptoms of an ineffective organizational structure include too
               many levels of management, too many meetings attended by too many people, too much atten-
               tion being directed toward solving interdepartmental conflicts, too large a span of control, and
               too many unachieved objectives. Changes in structure can facilitate strategy-implementation ef-
               forts, but changes in structure should not be expected to make a bad strategy good, to make bad
               managers good, or to make bad products sell.

               TABLE 7-6 Symptoms of an Ineffective Organizational Structure

                   1. Too many levels of management
                   2. Too many meetings attended by too many people

                   7. Losing ground to rival firms
                   8. Revenue or earnings divided by number of employees or number of managers is low compared to
                      rival firms


                    Structure undeniably can and does influence strategy. Strategies formulated must be work-
               able, so if a certain new strategy requires massive structural changes, it may not be an attractive
               choice. In this way, structure can shape the choice of strategies. But a more important concern
               is determining what types of structural changes are needed to implement new strategies and
               how these changes can best be accomplished. There is no one optimal organizational design or
               structure for a given strategy or type of organization. What is appropriate for one organization
               may not be appropriate for a similar firm, although successful firms in a given industry do tend
               to organize themselves in a similar way. For example, consumer goods companies tend to emu-
               late the divisional structure-by-product form of organization. Small firms tend to be functionally
               structured (centralized). Medium-sized firms tend to be divisionally structured (decentralized).
               Large firms tend to use a strategic business unit (SBU) structure or matrix structure. These types
               of structure are discussed in the next section.


               Types of Organizational Structure                                                                     LO 7.6
               Structure matters! There are seven basic types of organizational structure: (1) functional, (2)
               divisional-by-region, (3) divisional-by-product, (4) divisional-by-customer, (5) divisional-
               by-process, (6) strategic business unit (SBU), and (7) matrix. Companies, like people and
               armies, strive to be better organized or structured than rivals because better organization can
               yield tremendous competitive advantages. There are countless examples throughout history
               of incidents, battles, and companies where superior organization overcame massive odds
               against the entity.

               The Functional Structure
               The most widely used structure is the functional or centralized type because this structure is
               the simplest and least expensive of the seven alternatives. A functional structure groups tasks

                                  and activities by business function, such as marketing or finance. For example, a university may
                                  structure its activities by major functions that include academic affairs, student services, alumni
                                  relations, athletics, maintenance, and accounting.
                                        Under a functional structure, divisions or segments of the firm are not delegated author-
                                  ity, responsibility, and accountability for revenues or profits; rather, key decisions are made
                                  centrally. For example, a small business composed of three restaurants in three adjacent
                                  towns is functionally structured if all hiring, firing, promotion, and advertising decisions are
                                  made centrally, but this same small business is divisionally structured if those decisions are
                                  delegated to each restaurant manager. Besides being simple and inexpensive, a functional
                                  structure also promotes specialization of labor, encourages efficient use of managerial and
                                  technical talent, minimizes the need for an elaborate control system, and allows rapid deci-
                                  sion making.
                                        Some disadvantages of a functional structure are that it forces accountability to the top,
                                  minimizes career development opportunities, and is sometimes characterized by low employee
                                  morale, line or staff conflicts, poor delegation of authority, and inadequate planning for products
                                  and markets. For these reasons, most large companies have abandoned the functional structure in
                                  favor of decentralization and improved accountability. Table 7-7 summarizes the advantages and
                                  disadvantages of a functional organizational structure.

                                     A functional structure often leads to short-term and narrow thinking that may undermine
                                  what is best for the firm as a whole. For example, the research-and-development department
                                  may strive to overdesign products and components to achieve technical elegance, whereas
                                  manufacturing may argue for low-frills products that can be mass-produced more easily. Thus,
                                  communication is often not as good in a functional structure. Schein gives an example of a com-
                                  munication problem in a functional structure:

                                     The word “marketing” will mean product development to the engineer, studying custom-
                                     ers through market research to the product manager, merchandising to the salesperson, and
                                     constant change in design to the manufacturing manager. Then when these managers try
                                     to work together, they often attribute disagreements to personalities and fail to notice the
                                     deeper, shared assumptions that vary and dictate how each function thinks.4


                                  The Divisional Structure
                                  The divisional (decentralized) structure is the second-most common type. Divisions are
                                  sometimes referred to as segments, profit centers, or business units. As a small organization
                                  grows, it has more difficulty managing different products in different markets. Some form of
                                  divisional structure generally becomes necessary to motivate employees, control operations,
                                  and compete successfully in diverse locations. The divisional structure can be organized in
                                  one of four ways: (1) by geographic area, (2) by product, (3) by customer, or (4) by process.

               With a divisional structure, functional activities are performed both centrally and in each
               separate division.
                    Kodak recently reduced its number of business units from seven by-customer divisions to
               five by-product divisions. As consumption patterns become increasingly similar worldwide, a
               by-product structure becomes more effective than a by-customer or by-geographic type of divi-
               sional structure. In restructuring, Kodak eliminated its global operations division and distributed
               those responsibilities across the new by-product divisions.
                    A divisional structure has some clear advantages. First and perhaps foremost, accountability
               is clear. That is, divisional managers can be held responsible for sales and profit levels. Because
               a divisional structure is based on extensive delegation of authority, managers and employees
               can easily see the results of their good or bad performances. As a result, employee morale is
               generally higher in a divisional structure than in a centralized structure. Other advantages of the
               divisional design are that it creates career development opportunities for managers, allows local
               control of situations, leads to a competitive climate within an organization, and allows new busi-
               nesses and products to be added easily.
                    The divisional design is not without some limitations, however. Perhaps the most important
               limitation is that a divisional structure is costly, for a number of reasons. First, each division
               requires functional specialists who must be paid. Second, there exists some duplication of staff
               services, facilities, and personnel; for instance, functional specialists are also needed centrally (at
               headquarters) to coordinate divisional activities. Third, managers must be well qualified because
               the divisional design forces delegation of authority; better-qualified individuals require higher
               salaries. A divisional structure can also be costly because it requires an elaborate, headquarters-
               driven control system. Fourth, competition between divisions may become so intense that it is
               dysfunctional and leads to limited sharing of ideas and resources for the common good of the
               firm. Table 7-8 gives the advantages and disadvantages of a divisional organizational structure.

                                                                         7. Some regions, products, or customers may

                    A divisional-by-region type of structure is appropriate for organizations whose strategies
               need to be tailored to fit the particular needs and characteristics of customers in different geo-
               graphic areas. This type of structure can be most appropriate for organizations that have similar
               branch facilities located in widely dispersed areas. A divisional structure by geographic area al-
               lows local participation in decision making and improved coordination within a region.
                    The divisional-by-product (or service) type of structure is most effective for implementing
               strategies when specific products need special emphasis. Also, this type of structure is widely
               used when an organization offers only a few products or when an organization’s products or
               services differ substantially. The divisional-by-product structure allows strict control over and
               attention to product lines, but it may also require a more skilled management force and reduced
               top management control.
                    A divisional-by-customer type of structure can be the most effective way to implement
               strategies when a few major customers are of paramount importance and many different services
               are provided to these customers. This structure allows an organization to cater effectively to the

                                  requirements of clearly defined customer groups. For example, book-publishing companies often
                                  organize their activities around customer groups, such as colleges, secondary schools, and private
                                  commercial schools. Some airline companies have two major customer divisions: (1) passengers
                                  and (2) freight or cargo services. Utility companies often use (1) commercial, (2) residential, and
                                  (3) industrial as their divisions by customer.
                                       A divisional-by-process type of structure is similar to a functional structure because activi-
                                  ties are organized according to the way work is actually performed. However, a key difference
                                  between these two designs is that functional departments are not accountable for profits or reve-
                                  nues, whereas divisional process departments are evaluated on these criteria. An example of a di-
                                  visional structure by process is a manufacturing business organized into six divisions: electrical
                                  work, glass cutting, welding, grinding, painting, and foundry work. In this case, all operations
                                  related to these specific processes would be grouped under the separate divisions. Each process
                                  (division) would be responsible for generating revenues and profits. The divisional structure by
                                  process can be particularly effective in achieving objectives when distinct production processes
                                  represent the thrust of competitiveness in an industry.

                                  The Strategic Business Unit Structure
                                  As the number, size, and diversity of divisions in an organization increase, controlling and evalu-
                                  ating divisional operations become increasingly difficult for strategists. Increases in sales often
                                  are not accompanied by similar increases in profitability. The span of control becomes too large
                                  at top levels of the firm. For example, in a large conglomerate organization composed of 90 divi-
                                  sions, such as ConAgra, the CEO could have difficulty even remembering the first names of divi-
                                  sional presidents. In multidivisional organizations, a strategic business unit (SBU) structure can
                                  greatly facilitate strategy-implementation efforts.
                                       An SBU structure simply groups similar divisions together into “units” and delegates author-
                                  ity and responsibility for each unit to a senior executive who reports directly to the CEO. This
                                  change in structure can facilitate strategy implementation by improving coordination between
                                  similar divisions and channeling accountability to distinct business units. In a 100-division con-
                                  glomerate, the divisions could perhaps be regrouped into 10 SBUs according to certain common
                                  characteristics, such as competing in the same industry, being located in the same area, or having
                                  the same customers.
                                       A disadvantage of an SBU structure is that it requires an additional layer of management,
                                  which increases salary expenses. However, this limitations does not outweigh the advantages of
                                  improved coordination and accountability. Another advantage of the SBU structure is that it makes
                                  the tasks of planning and control by the corporate office more manageable. Halliburton oper-
                                  ates from an SBU structure with the divisions based on process, as described at www.halliburton
                                  .com (click on About Us, then click Corporate Profile, then scroll down to see the SBUs listed).
                                  Microsoft recently changed its organizational structure to become three by-product strategic
                                  business units: (1) Windows and Devices Group (WDG), (2) Cloud and Enterprise (C+E), and
                                  (3) Applications and Services Group (ASG).

                                  The Matrix Structure
                                  A matrix structure is an organizational design in which vertical and horizontal flows of author-
                                  ity and communication (hence the term matrix) are created whereby functions are horizontally
                                  arrayed and divisions, products, or projects are vertically arrayed. In contrast, functional and
                                  divisional structures depend primarily on a vertical chain of command and authority. A matrix
                                  structure can result in higher overhead because it creates more management positions. Other
                                  disadvantages of a matrix structure that contribute to overall complexity include dual lines of
                                  budget authority (a violation of the unity-of-command principle), dual sources of reward and
                                  punishment, shared authority, dual reporting channels, and a need for an extensive and effective
                                  communication system.
                                       The matrix structure is often used in the construction and health care industries. For example,
                                  in the construction industry, a matrix structure would work well for Bechtel Corporation and Fluor
                                  Corporation, since every construction project has a head project person, and if the project is large,
                                  such as when Fluor worked on the 800-mile Trans-Alaska Pipeline System, each project also has
                                  a head HR person, who reports both to the head project person and the corporate head HR person.

                    As indicated in Table 7-9, some advantages of a matrix structure are that project objectives
               are clear, there are many channels of communication, workers can see the visible results of their
               work, shutting down a project can be accomplished relatively easily, and it facilitates the use
               of specialized personnel, equipment, and facilities. Functional resources are shared in a matrix
               structure, rather than duplicated as in a divisional structure. Individuals with a high degree of

                                           expertise can divide their time as needed among projects, and they in turn develop their own
                                           skills and competencies more than in other structures.
                                                A typical matrix structure, inclusive of typical executive titles, is illustrated in Figure 7-4.
                                           Note that the letters (A through Z4) refer to managers. For example, if you were manager A,
                                           you would be responsible for financial aspects of Project 1, and you would have two bosses: the
                                           Project 1 Manager on site and the CFO off site.



                                  LO 7.7   Do’s and Don’ts in Developing Organizational Charts
                                           Students analyzing strategic-management cases (and actual corporate executives) often revise
                                           and improve a firm’s organizational structure. This section provides basic guidelines and several
                                           dos and don’ts in regards to developing organizational charts, especially for midsize to large
                                           firms. First of all, reserve the title CEO for the top executive of the firm. Do not use the title
                                           president for the top person; use it for the division top managers if there are divisions within the
                                           firm. Also, do not use the title president for functional business executives. They should have
                                           the title chief, vice-president, manager, or officer, such as “Chief Information Officer,” or “VP
                                           of Human Resources.” Furthermore, do not recommend a dual title (such as CEO and president)
                                           for just one executive.
                                                 Do not let a single individual be both chairman of the board and CEO of a company.
                                           Of note, chairperson or chair is much better than chairman for the top board person’s title.
                                           Corporate America is splitting the chair of the board and the CEO positions in publicly held
                                           companies. This movement includes asking the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq to adopt
                                           listing rules that would require separate positions. About 50 percent of companies in the S&P
                                           500 stock index have separate positions, up from 22 percent in 2002. Many more European and
                                           Asian companies split the two positions. For example, 80 percent of British companies split the
                                           positions, and virtually all German and Dutch companies split the positions. For the first time
                                           ever, the South Korean firm Samsung Electronics separated the role and title of its Chair of the
                                           Board from its CEO in 2018.
                                                 Directly below the CEO, it is best to have a chief operating officer (COO) with any division
                                           presidents reporting directly to the COO. On the same level as the COO and also reporting to the
                                           CEO are functional business executives, such as a chief financial officer (CFO), VP of human
                                           resources, a chief strategy officer (CSO), a chief information officer (CIO), a chief marketing
                                           officer (CMO), a VP of R&D, a VP of legal affairs, an investment relations officer, maintenance
                                           officer, and so on. Note in Figure 7-6 that these positions are labeled and placed appropriately
                                           in a matrix structure, which, as shown, generally include project managers rather than division
                                           presidents reporting to a COO.
                                                 The COO position is increasingly being deleted in U.S. companies. Twitter recently divided
                                           the duties of its COO among all managers. McDonald’s, Tiffany & Co., and Yahoo recently deleted
                                           their COO position. In fact, the percentage of large companies in the United States with COOs
                                           has declined almost every year for a decade, to about 35 percent today. Healthcare and industrial
                                           companies are least likely to have a COO today. An accounting firm, PricewaterhouseCoopers,
                                           suggests there are four reasons why companies are phasing out the COO position to: (1) flatten
                                           their structure, (2) eliminate a layer of management, (3) reduce costs, and (4) expand the CEO’s
                                           authority and responsibility. Digital communications and even social media today enable a CEO
                                           often to perform COO duties. Many companies now delegate the traditional duties of a COO to
                                           the CEO or to other positions, such as the CFO or chief brand officer. Deleting the COO position
                                           does increase the span of control of the CEO, spreading the latter thinly, which is not a good idea
                                           for many companies.
                                                 In developing an organizational chart, avoid having a particular person reporting to more
                                           than one person in the chain of command (except in a matrix structure). This would violate the
                                           unity-of-command principle of management that “every employee should have just one boss.”
                                           Also, do not have any functional positions such as CFO, CIO, CSO, and human resource officer
                                           report to the COO. All these positions report directly to the CEO.
                                                 In contrast to the COO position, the number of chief accounting officers (CAO) among U.S.
                                           companies is increasing. CAOs now do much more than just manage the company’s books and
                                           prepare financial statements. They stand up and debate strategic issues related to how best to

               balance the balance sheet, when and how to recognize revenue, and know how to report results
               using both U.S. and foreign standards (GAAP vs. IFRS). CAOs are more commonly signing the
               company’s financial filings, making them personally liable for any mistakes or improprieties—
               along with the CFO and CEO.
                    Garu Kabureck, former CAO at Xerox Corp. says: “I think what happened over the last 15
               years in the USA is that the accounting function started to separate from the controller function.”
               In a firm, a controller is typically more focused on budgeting and planning, whereas the CAO is
               responsible for the ins and outs of global bookkeeping. The CAO also interacts closely with the
               board’s audit committee, as well as with outside firms auditing the company.
                    A relatively new, but increasingly popular, top management position, is the Chief Design
               Officer (CDO). Johnson & Johnson (J&J), for example, hired a CDO, Ernesto Quinteros, to be
               a liaison between the CMO and R&D officer. The CDO position has equal status with the CMO
               position at J&J, PepsiCo, and Phillips Electronics NV because “a product that is wonderfully
               designed sells itself, and has a huge benefit on the marketing side,” said J&J’s Sandi Peterson,
               who created the CDO position at J&J.
                    One never knows for sure if a proposed or actual structure is indeed most effective for
               a particular firm. Declining financial performance signals a need for altering the structure.
               Important guidelines to follow in devising organizational charts for companies are provided in
               Table 7-10.


               TABLE 7-10 15 Guidelines for Developing an Organizational Chart

                    1.   Instead of chairman of the board, make it chairperson of the board.
                    2.   Make sure the board of directors reveals diversity in race, ethnicity, gender, and age.
                    3.   Make sure the chair of the board is not also the CEO or president of the company.
                    4.   Make sure the CEO of the firm does not also carry the title president.
                    5.   Reserve the title president for the division heads of the firm.
                    6.   Include a COO if divisions are large or geographically dispersed.
                    7.   Make sure only presidents of divisions report to the COO.
                    8.   Make sure functional executives such as CFO, CIO, CMO, CSO, R&D, CLO, CTO, and HRM
                         report to the CEO, not the COO.
                    9.   Make sure every executive has one boss, so lines in the chart should be drawn accordingly, assur-
                         ing unity of command.
                   10.   Make sure span of control is reasonable, probably no more than 10 persons reporting to any
                         other person.
                   11.   Make sure diversity in race, ethnicity, gender, and age is well represented among corporate
                         executives.
                   12.   Avoid a functional type structure for all but the smallest firms.
                   13.   Decentralize, using some form of divisional structure, whenever possible.
                   14.   Use a SBU type structure for large firms with more than 10 divisions.
                   15.   Make sure executive titles match product names as best possible in division-by-product and
                         SBU-designated firms.



               How to Depict an Organizational Chart
               For whatever reason, companies rarely provide a diagram of their organizational chart, neither
               in their Form 10K or on their corporate website. Therefore, students often wrestle with actually
               drawing an existing chart and devising a new and improved organizational chart. Nearly all com-
               panies provide, however, a list of their top executives and associated titles. This “title” informa-
               tion can be used to develop existing and proposed charts. Follow three simple steps to develop
               organizational charts:

                    Step 1. List executive positions by title and number. Numbering positions enables num-
                             bers, rather than boxes or circles, to be used in a structure diagram to reveal report-
                             ing relationships; it is just easier to use numbers.

                                                  Step 2. Using numbers to denote positions, devise your chart to show reporting relation-
                                                           ships, consistent with guidelines presented in this chapter.
                                                  Step 3. Draw lines connecting numbers to reveal reporting relationships. Be mindful that
                                                           a line connecting one number to another means that person reports to the other; so
                                                           do not connect, for example, a CFO to a CMO.
                                                 Figure 7-5 and Figure 7-6 give an existing and improved organizational chart for ABC
                                            Company, respectively. ABC Company’s example charts demonstrate how to apply the three
                                            steps given. In devising any organizational chart, do not be concerned with the names of
                                            executives because people come and go in a firm; positions stay relatively constant. Also,
                                            do not be overly concerned with the existing chart reporting relationships because those are
                                            usually unknown to all but corporate insiders; your new and improved chart is of paramount
                                            importance. Also, do not include the 20 or so lower and mid-level managers in a chart;
                                            similarly, do not include the board of director members in a chart. It’s not that lower and
                                            mid-level managers and board members are not important because they are. It is just that re-
                                            porting relationships among the top executives in a firm reveals the (1) type of structure and
                                            (2) chain of command. The firm must get those two aspects correct to effectively implement
                                            any strategy.

               Production/operations capabilities, limitations, and policies can significantly enhance or inhibit
               the attainment of objectives. Production processes typically constitute more than 70 percent of
               a firm’s total assets. Thus, a major part of the strategy-implementation process takes place at the
               production site. Strategic production-related decisions on plant size, plant location, product de-
               sign, choice of equipment, kind of tooling, size of inventory, inventory control, quality control,
               cost control, use of standards, job specialization, employee training, equipment and resource
               utilization, shipping and packaging, and technological innovation can determine the success or
               failure of strategy-implementation efforts.
                    Three production/operations issues, (1) restructuring/reengineering, (2) managing resis-
               tance to change, and (3) deciding where/how to produce goods, are especially important for suc-
               cessful strategy implementation and are therefore discussed next.

                                  Restructuring and Reengineering
                                  Restructuring and reengineering are forms of retrenchment discussed in Chapter 5.
                                  Restructuring, sometimes called downsizing, involves reducing the size of the firm in terms
                                  of number of employees, number of divisions or units, and number of hierarchical levels in the
                                  firm’s organizational structure. This reduction in size is intended to improve both efficiency and
                                  effectiveness. Restructuring is concerned primarily with shareholder well-being rather than em-
                                  ployee well-being.
                                        The primary benefit sought from restructuring is cost reduction. For some highly bureau-
                                  cratic firms, restructuring can actually rescue the firm from global competition and demise. But
                                  the downside of restructuring can be reduced employee commitment, creativity, and innovation
                                  associated with pending and actual employee layoffs. In 2018, General Electric restructured,
                                  reducing its six commercial business units down to three.
                                        Job security in European companies is slowly moving toward a U.S. business model, in
                                  which firms lay off almost at will. From banks in Milan to factories in Mannheim, European
                                  employers are starting to show people the door in an effort to streamline operations, in-
                                  crease efficiency, and compete against already slim-and-trim U.S. firms. European firms
                                  still prefer to downsize by attrition and retirement, rather than by blanket layoffs because of
                                  culture, laws, and unions.
                                        In contrast to restructuring, reengineering is concerned more with employee and customer
                                  well-being than shareholder well-being. Reengineering involves reconfiguring or redesign-
                                  ing work, jobs, and processes for the purpose of improving cost, quality, service, and speed.
                                  Reengineering does not usually affect the organizational structure or chart, nor does it imply job
                                  loss or employee layoffs. Whereas restructuring is concerned with eliminating or establishing,
                                  shrinking or enlarging, and moving organizational departments and divisions, the focus of reen-
                                  gineering is changing the way work is actually carried out. Reengineering is characterized by
                                  many tactical (short-term, business-function-specific) decisions, whereas restructuring is charac-
                                  terized by strategic (long-term, affecting all business functions) decisions.

                                  Manage Resistance to Change
                                  No organization or individual can escape change. But the thought of change raises anxieties
                                  because people fear economic loss, inconvenience, uncertainty, and a break in normal social
                                  patterns. Almost any change in structure, technology, people, or strategies has the potential to
                                  disrupt comfortable interaction patterns. For this reason, people resist change. The strategic-
                                  management process can impose major changes on individuals and processes. Reorienting an
                                  organization to get people to think and act strategically is not an easy task. Strategy implementa-
                                  tion can pose a threat to many managers and employees. New power and status relationships are
                                  anticipated and realized. New formal and informal groups’ values, beliefs, and priorities may be
                                  largely unknown. Managers and employees may become engaged in resistance behavior as their
                                  roles, prerogatives, and power in the firm change. Disruption of social and political structures
                                  that accompany strategy execution must be anticipated and considered during strategy formula-
                                  tion and managed during strategy implementation.
                                       Resistance to change may be the single-greatest threat to successful strategy implementa-
                                  tion. Resistance regularly occurs in organizations in the form of sabotaging production machines,
                                  absenteeism, filing unfounded grievances, and an unwillingness to cooperate. People often resist
                                  strategy implementation because they do not understand what is happening or why changes are
                                  taking place. In that case, employees may simply need accurate information. Successful strategy
                                  implementation hinges on managers’ ability to develop an organizational climate conducive to
                                  change. Change must be viewed by managers and employees as an opportunity for the firm to
                                  compete more effectively, rather than being seen as a threat to everyone’s livelihood.
                                       Strategists can take a number of positive actions to minimize managers’ and employees’ resis-
                                  tance to change. For example, individuals who will be affected by a change should be involved in
                                  the decision to make the change and in decisions about how to implement the change. Strategists
                                  should anticipate changes and develop and offer training and development workshops so that man-
                                  agers and employees can adapt to those changes. They also need to effectively communicate the
                                  need for changes. Strategy implementation is basically a process of managing change.

               Decide Where and How to Produce Goods
               In China, about 700,000 assembly workers at manufacturing contractors such as Foxconn put
               together Apple products. It would be virtually impossible to bring those jobs to the United States
               for at least three reasons. First, Foxconn—China’s largest private employer and the manufac-
               turer of an estimated 40 percent of the world’s consumer electronic devices—pays its assembly
               workers far less than U.S. labor laws would allow. A typical salary is about $18 a day. Second,
               Foxconn and other Chinese manufacturing operations house employees in dormitories and can
               send hundreds of thousands of workers to the assembly lines at a moment’s notice. On the lines,
               workers are subjected to what most Americans would consider unbearably long hours and tough
               working conditions. That system gives tech companies the efficiency needed to race products
               out the door, so speed is a bigger factor than pay. Finally, most of the component suppliers for
               Apple and other technology giants are also in China or other Asian countries. That geographic
               clustering gives companies the flexibility to change a product design at the last minute and still
               ship on time.
                    Examples of adjustments in production systems that could be required to implement vari-
               ous strategies are provided in Table 7-11 for both for-profit and nonprofit organizations. The
               largest bicycle company in the United States, Huffy, recently ended its own production of
               bikes and now contracts out those services to Asian and Mexican manufacturers. Huffy focuses
               instead on the design, marketing, and distribution of bikes, but it no longer produces bikes
               themselves. The Dayton, Ohio, company closed its plants in Ohio, Missouri, and Mississippi.

               and tax considerations, language and legal issues, and the availability of trainable employees.
               Some of these factors explain why many manufacturing operations in China are moving back to
               Mexico, to Vietnam, or even back to the United States. President Donald Trump has pledged to
               create such a pro-business environment that companies will reshore (relocate) their manufactur-

               this section, as follows: (1) linking performance and pay to strategy, (2) balancing work life with
               home life, (3) developing a diverse workforce, (4) using caution in hiring a rival’s employees,
               (5) creating a strategy-supportive culture, (6) using caution in monitoring employees’ social me-
               dia, and (7) developing a corporate well-being program.

    248   PART 3 • STRATEGY IMPLEMENTATION

                                  Link Performance and Pay to Strategy
                                  An organization’s compensation system needs to be aligned with strategic outcomes. Decisions
                                  on salary increases, promotions, merit pay, and bonuses need to support the long-term and an-
                                  nual objectives of the firm. A dual bonus system based on both annual and long-term objectives
                                  can be helpful in linking performance and pay to strategies. The percentage of a manager’s an-
                                  nual bonus attributable to short-term versus long-term results should vary by hierarchical level
                                  in the organization. It is important that bonuses not be based solely on short-term results because
                                  such a system ignores long-term company strategies and objectives.
                                       Bank of America’s 2018 compensation plan includes a bonus system that allows brokers
                                  in its wealth-management team to earn up to an additional 2 percent in pay if certain growth
                                  targets are achieved. Merrill Lynch brokers receive a similar bonus but, if Merrill brokers fail to
                                  meet minimum growth targets, their pay is reduced 2 percent. Bank of America has no such pay
                                  penalty provision.
                                       Criteria such as sales, profit, production efficiency, quality, and safety could also serve as
                                  bases for an effective bonus system. If an organization meets certain understood, agreed-on
                                  profit objectives, every member of the enterprise should share in the harvest. A bonus system can
                                  be an effective tool for motivating individuals to support strategy-implementation efforts. Bank
                                  of America, for example, recently overhauled its incentive system to link pay to sales of the
                                  bank’s most profitable products and services. Branch managers receive a base salary plus a bo-
                                  nus based both on the number of new customers and on sales of bank products. Every employee
                                  in each branch is also eligible for a bonus if the branch exceeds its goals. Thomas Peterson, a top
                                  Bank of America executive, says, “We want to make people responsible for meeting their goals,
                                  so we pay incentives on sales, not on controlling costs or on being sure the parking lot is swept.”
                                       A combination of reward strategy incentives, such as salary raises, stock options, employees
                                  benefits, promotions, praise, recognition, criticism, fear, increased job autonomy, and awards,
                                  can be used to encourage managers and employees to push hard for successful strategic imple-
                                  mentation. The range of options for getting people, departments, and divisions to actively sup-
                                  port strategy-implementation activities in a particular organization is almost limitless. A firm,
                                  for example, could give its employees a 10-year option to buy up to 1000 shares of company
                                  stock at a set price lower than the current market price.
                                       For the first time ever in 2018, U.S. publicly-held companies were required to divulge their
                                  median employee pay in addition to CEO pay, as well as the ratio between the two figures. For
                                  example, Whirlpool Corporation revealed that its median worker earns $19,906 a year, while
                                  the CEO made $7.08 million, or 356 times as much. At another firm, Intuitive Surgical, the
                                  median employee was paid just over $157,000, while the CEO got $5.1 million, or 32 times the
                                  employee amount. Marathon Petroleum’s median worker made $21,034 versus its CEO making
                                  $19.7 million, or 935 times the employee amount.

                                  Balance Work Life and Home Life
                                  Work and family strategies now represent a competitive advantage for those firms that offer
                                  such benefits as elder-care assistance, flexible scheduling, job sharing, adoption benefits, on-site
                                  summer camp, employee help lines, pet care, and even lawn service referrals. New corporate
                                  titles such as Work and Life Coordinator and Director of Diversity are becoming common.
                                  Globally, it is widely acknowledged that the best countries for working women are Iceland,
                                  Norway, Sweden, Finland, and Denmark, all of which rate above the United States. According
                                  to the World Economic Forum’s Global Gender Gap Index Report, the United States, in fact,
                                  ranked forty-fifth overall.
                                        Working Mother magazine annually publishes its listing of “The 100 Best Companies for
                                  Working Mothers” (www.workingmother.com). Three especially important variables used in
                                  the ranking are availability of flextime, advancement opportunities, and equitable distribution of
                                  benefits. Other important criteria are compressed weeks, telecommuting, job sharing, childcare
                                  facilities, maternity leave for both parents, mentoring, career development, and promotion for
                                  women. Working Mother’s top 10 best companies for working women in 2017 are provided in
                                  Table 7-12. Working Mother also conducts extensive research to determine the best U.S. firms
                                  for women of color.

                    A good home life contributes immensely to a good work life. The work and family issue
               is no longer just a women’s issue. Some specific measures that firms are taking to address this
               issue are providing spouse relocation assistance as an employee benefit; supplying company
               resources for family recreational and educational use; establishing employee country clubs, such
               as those at IBM and Bethlehem Steel; and creating family and work interaction opportunities. A
               study by Joseph Pleck of Wheaton College found that in companies that do not offer paternity or
               paid family leave for fathers as a benefit, most men still take short, informal leaves and do so by
               combining vacation time and sick days.
                    Some organizations have developed family days, when family members are invited into
               the workplace, taken on plant or office tours, dined by management, and given a chance to
               see exactly what other family members do each day. Family days are inexpensive and in-
               crease the employee’s pride in working for the organization. Flexible working hours during
               the week are another human-resource response to the need for individuals to balance work
               life and home life.

               Promote Diversity
               The term glass ceiling refers to the invisible barrier in many firms that bars women and people
               of color from top-level management positions. Michele Buck became Hershey Company’s CEO
               in 2017, becoming the twenty-eighth female to head a Fortune 500 business, up from 21 in 2013.
               Thus, progress in this regard is slow, even in the United States.
                    An organization can perhaps be most effective when its workforce mirrors the diversity of
               its customers. Six benefits of having a diverse workforce are as follows:

                   1. Women and minorities have different insights, opinions, and perspectives that should be
                      considered.
                   2. A diverse workforce portrays a firm committed to nondiscrimination.
                   3. A workforce that mirrors a customer base can help attract customers, build customer loy-
                      alty, and design or offer products and services that meet customer needs and wants.
                   4. A diverse workforce helps protect the firm against discrimination lawsuits.
                   5. Women and minorities represent a huge additional pool of qualified applicants.
                   6. A diverse workforce strengthens a firm’s social responsibility and ethical position.

                   A January 2018 article in Fortune (p. 44) revealed several companies that have a really
               high percentage of people of color on its payroll: Hyatt Hotels (65%), Marriott International
               (65%), Publix Super Markets (42%), Capital One Financial (49%), and Kimpton Hotels and
               Restaurants (60%).

                                  Use Caution in Hiring a Rival’s Employees
                                  An article titled “Dos and Don’ts of Poaching Workers” in Investor’s Business Daily gives
                                  guidelines to consider before hiring a rival firm’s employees.5 The practice of hiring employees
                                  from rival firms has a long tradition, but increasingly in our lawsuit-happy environment, firms
                                  must consider whether that person(s) had access to the “secret sauce formula, customer list,
                                  programming algorithm, or any proprietary or confidential information” of the rival firm. If the
                                  person has that information and joins your firm, lawsuits could follow that hiring, especially if
                                  the person was under contract at the rival firm or had signed a “noncompete agreement.” The
                                  article says that to help safeguard the firm from this potential problem, a “well-written employee
                                  handbook” addressing the issue is necessary. The article talks about Hewlett-Packard (HP) re-
                                  cently hiring an IBM general manager, and IBM suing HP over the hiring; IBM lost in that case,
                                  but this type of legal action is becoming more commonplace.
                                       According to Wayne Perrett, human resource manager for ComAp in Roscoe, Illinois, “A
                                  company does not want to become known as one that ‘steals’ employees from competitors; that
                                  is bad for ethics and bad for business.” It is not illegal to interview and hire employees from rival
                                  firms, and it has been done for centuries, but increasingly this is becoming a strategic issue to be
                                  managed, to avoid litigation.


                                  Create a Strategy-Supportive Culture
                                  All organizations have a unique culture. For example, at Facebook, Inc., employees are given
                                  unusual freedom to choose and change assignments. Even low-level employees are encouraged
                                  to question and criticize managers. Facebook employees are rated on a normal distribution curve
                                  (Bell curve), which creates a hectic, intense work environment where past accomplishments
                                  mean little compared to what you have done lately for the firm. Managers are not revered at
                                  Facebook as bosses; rather, they are regarded as helpers.
                                       Strategists should strive to preserve, emphasize, and build on aspects of an existing cul-
                                  ture that support proposed new strategies. Aspects of an existing culture that are antagonistic
                                  to a proposed strategy should be identified and changed. Changing a firm’s culture to fit a new
                                  strategy is usually more effective than changing a strategy to fit an existing culture. As indicated
                                  in Table 7-13, numerous techniques are available to alter an organization’s culture, including
                                  recruitment, training, transfer, promotion, restructure of an organization’s design, role modeling,
                                  positive reinforcement, and mentoring.
                                       In the personal and religious side of life, the impact of loss and change is easy to see.6
                                  Memories of loss and change often haunt individuals and organizations for years. Ibsen wrote,
                                  “Rob the average man of his life illusion and you rob him of his happiness at the same stroke.”7
                                  When attachments to a culture are severed in an organization’s attempt to change direction,
                                  employees and managers often experience deep feelings of grief. This phenomenon commonly
                                  occurs when external conditions dictate the need for a new strategy. Managers and employees
                                  often struggle to find meaning in a situation that changed years ago. Some people find comfort

               in memories; others find solace in the present. Weak linkages between strategic management and
               organizational culture can jeopardize performance and success. Deal and Kennedy emphasized
               that making strategic changes in an organization always threatens a culture:

                   People form strong attachments to heroes, legends, the rituals of daily life, the hoopla of
                   extravaganza and ceremonies, and all the symbols of the workplace. Change strips rela-
                   tionships and leaves employees confused, insecure, and often angry. Unless something
                   can be done to provide support for transitions from old to new, the force of a culture can
                   neutralize and emasculate strategy changes.8

                    Wells Fargo recently reinforced a business culture to sell more and more products to ex-
               isting bank customers, termed cross-selling—a market penetration strategy. This business cul-
               ture spiraled out of control; federal investigators found that Wells Fargo had opened as many
               as two million deposit and credit-card accounts without customers requesting or knowing of
               the actions. The cross-selling problem was systemic across all the company’s 6,000 branches
               and all its products. A spokeswoman at Wells Fargo responded to the fiasco saying: “We are
               committed to fixing this issue, to strengthening our culture throughout the company and tak-
               ing the necessary actions to begin restoring our customer’s trust.” Steven Schrodt worked
               at Wells Fargo and reported that employees at his branch had a daily goal to open two new
               checking accounts and make eight other product sales; Steven left the company because the
               sales pressure was too stressful. The Wells Fargo culture problem cost the firm billions in lost
               revenue, lawsuits, and penalties.


               Use Caution in Monitoring Employees’ Social Media
                Many companies monitor employees’ and prospective employees’ social-media activities, and
                have the legal right to do so, but there are many pros and cons of this activity. Proponents of com-
                panies monitoring employees’ social-media activities emphasize that (1) a company’s reputation
                in the marketplace can easily be damaged by disgruntled employees venting on social-media sites
                and (2) social-media records can be subpoenaed, like e-mail, and used as evidence against the
                company. Proponents say companies have a responsibility to know the nature of employees’ com-
                munication through social media as related to clients, patients, suppliers, distributors, coworkers,
                managers, technology, patents, procedures, policies, and much more. To ignore social-media
                communication by employees, proponents say, is irresponsible and too risky for the firm. Some
                companies use social media to research and screen job candidates, sometimes finding provocative
                or inappropriate photos and information related to potential employees’ bias, stereotypes, preju-
                dices, drinking, and drug use. Companies however should never use social media to discriminate
                based on age, race, ethnic background, religion, sexuality, or disability.
                     Arguments against the practice of companies monitoring employees’ social-media activities
                say it is an invasion of privacy and too often becomes “a fishing expedition” sifting through tons
                of personal information irrelevant to a company or its business. Positions on political issues, gun
                rights, or immigration are example topics where company researchers may “not like” individuals
                with different belief systems than their own. In a recent study, 77 percent of employers said they
                conduct Internet searches of prospective employees, and 35 percent have rejected job applicants
                because of information they found.9 Rejecting potential employees because of private behavior
               unrelated to work is unfair. In addition, whenever a company discovers through social media that
               an employee or potential employee is of a certain background or has a particular disability, and
               then denies a promotion or hires someone else; that “social media discovery information” could
               be the basis of a discrimination suit against the firm. For some jobs, such as law enforcement,
               due diligence may require firms to monitor social-media activities to help assure their entire
               workforce is not involved in drugs, child pornography, gangs, and so on.
                     On balance, companies should monitor employee and potential employee’s social-media
               activities whenever they have a reason to believe the person is engaged in illegal or unethical
               conduct, but to systematically investigate every employee and job candidate’s social-media
               ­activities is arguably counterproductive. The bottom line is that companies have the legal right
                to monitor employees’ conduct, but have the legal duty to do so only if there is sufficient reason
                for concern.

                                       Develop a Corporate Well-Being Program
                                       Corporate wellness has become a major strategic issue in companies. If you owned a company
                                       and paid the health insurance of employees, would you desire to have a healthy workforce? Your
                                       likely answer is yes because health insurance premiums are more costly for an unhealthy work-
                                       force. Healthy employees are more productive and less absent from work.
                                            The notion of corporate wellness is rapidly shifting from health assessment, weight loss, and
                                       biometric screenings to also include financial well-being, social networks, work-life balance, and
                                       overall well-being. The focus now is thus on lifestyle management rather than just cholesterol
                                       management; this shift includes such things as sit-stand desks in the workspace and access to the
                                       outdoors while at work. The term corporate wellness has largely been replaced with corporate
                                       well-being, and these newly designed programs are being used in recruitment and retention; the
                                       programs are being intertwined with company goals and objectives. LuAnn Heinen says “the hap-
                                       piness of your customers is a direct reflection of how happy and engaged your employees are.”
                                       Michael Sokol says “your corporate wellbeing program should be multi-year, with clear expecta-
                                       tions and should include the entire healthcare continuum”; a recent study concludes that wellness
                                       programs pay off because healthy employees are more productive employees.10

                                       Countless marketing considerations affect the success or failure of strategy implementation ef-
                                       forts, such as the following:
                                        1.   How to make advertisements more interactive to be more effective
                                        2.   How to take advantage of social-media conversations about the company and industry
                                        3.   To use exclusive dealerships or multiple channels of distribution
                                        4.   To use heavy, light, or no TV advertising versus online advertising
                                        5.   To limit (or not) the share of business done with a single supplier or business customer
                                        6.   To be a price leader or a price follower
                                        7.   To offer a complete or limited warranty
                                        8.   To extend an existing product line or create a new line of products
                                            Market segmentation, target marketing, and product positioning are marketing’s most im-
                                       portant contributions to strategic management. Strategies such as market development, product
                                       development, market penetration, and diversification require increased sales through new mar-
                                       kets or products. To implement strategies successfully, effective segmentation, targeting, and
                                       positioning are required and discussed next.


                                       Segment and Target Markets Effectively
                                       As illustrated in Figure 7-9, companies engage in market segmentation first, then target mar-
                                       keting, and then position products among industry offerings. Because consumers vary in their
                                       needs and wants, blanket marketing is rarely an effective strategy, partly due to the high cost of
                                       reaching everybody. Thus, firms engage in market segmentation, dividing a market into dis-
                                       tinct subsets of customers that differ from one another in product needs and buying habits. The
                                       segments are created based on unique demographic, geographic, psychographic, or behavioral
                                       characteristics of consumers. Successful strategy implementation requires effective (and effi-
                                       cient) marketing.
                                            Market segmentation requires strategists to determine the characteristics and needs of
                                       consumers, to analyze consumer similarities and differences, and to develop consumer group
                                       profiles. After segmenting markets, companies select particular segment(s) to target. Individual
                                       market segments differ in consumer needs and buying habits so firms carefully select segment(s)
                                       to target. Firms such as Marriott, InterContinental, and Wyndham have multiple brand hotels so
                                       they can market varied offerings tailored to particular target segments.
                                            As indicated in the mini-case at the end of this chapter, the world-renowned diamond en-
                                       gagement ring company De Beers recently repositioned itself to target younger consumers. This
                                       segmentation, targeting, and positioning was essential to the implementation of a new strategy

               aimed at attracting the market segment of millennials (people ages 18 to 34), which recently
               surpassed the number of baby boomers in the United States. Market segmentation and target-
               ing decisions directly affect the marketing mix variables: product, place, promotion, and price
               (discussed in Chapter 4, p. 132).

               Product Positioning
               After markets have been segmented and one or more segments have been selected as the target
               market(s), firms engage in positioning. Positioning entails designing a marketing mix that offers
               unique value to target customers. The product offering, its price, the way it is promoted or ad-
               vertised, and the channels through which it is sold all complement one another and are designed
               to attract a particular target market. As illustrated in Figure 7-10, product, price, promotion, and
               place aspects of any offering collectively yield value to a target market, resulting in consumer
               demand being high (or low) versus rival offerings.
                    Through marketing, Procter & Gamble (P&G) has effectively implemented ­product-development
               and market-penetration strategies. Consider the following P&G laundry detergent brands, for ex-

               “safely cleans baby clothing.” These detergents target unique segments and are positioned as such.

                                                  Changing brand names is a tactic marketers use to reposition a company’s offerings.
                                            Walmart recently implemented strategies aimed at growing its online market and increas-
                                            ing online sales, so the company changed its official name from Wal-Mart Stores Inc. to
                                            Walmart, Inc.
                                                  Because 95 percent of the world’s population (potential customers) lives outside the U.S.,
                                            it is becoming increasingly common for companies to offer their goods and services abroad.
                                            Marketers often are charged with leading the way on global expansion, but there are many
                                            guidelines to follow in global marketing, such as tailoring a firm’s website and social-media
                                            platforms to fit the specific target markets. Global Capsule 7 reveals four important guidelines
                                            for global marketing.

                                            Perceptual Mapping
                                            Firms continuously monitor the image of their brands as perceived by consumers. A
                                            ­product-positioning tool widely used in marketing is perceptual mapping, or developing
                                             schematic representations to reflect how a firm’s goods or services compare to competitors’
                                             in the mind of consumers. Perceptual mapping is widely used for deciding how to better
                                             meet the needs and wants of particular consumer groups. The technique can be summarized
                                             in five steps:

                                              1. Select key criteria that effectively differentiate products in the industry. Specifically, con-
                                                 sider the key characteristics of your brand offerings that provide unique value to your target
                                                 customers.
                                              2. Diagram a two-dimensional product-positioning map with specified criteria on each axis.
                                              3. Plot major competitors’ brands in the resultant four-quadrant matrix.
                                              4. Assess whether your brand’s location in the matrix is ideal, especially relative to com-
                                                 petitors. That is, consider whether your brand’s position, as perceived by consumers, offers
                                                 unique value.
                                              5. Reposition your brand’s offering as needed to shift consumers’ perceptions of the brand to
                                                 a location that provides a competitive advantage over rival brands.

                     An effective product-positioning strategy uniquely distinguishes a company from the com-
                petition. Companies commonly develop several perceptual maps to better understand competi-
                tive advantages and disadvantages versus rival companies, rival products, or in-house products.
                Figure 7-11 shows a perceptual map of major U.S. auto insurance companies. Consider for
                example that Allstate is implementing a market-penetration strategy with objectives aimed at
                increasing revenue; the perceptual map in Figure 7-11 may help guide Allstate managers by
                suggesting that the firm needs to either focus on improving customer service or lowering prices.
                For incumbent firms planning to enter the auto-insurance business as part of a diversification or
                product-development strategy, the perceptual map in Figure 7-11 could foster the implementa-
                tion of such strategies.
                     Figure 7-11 indicates that several firms already offer average range prices and customer
               ­service, but a firm could perhaps differentiate itself by offering enhanced customer service
                for moderately or slightly higher prices (while remaining below State Farm). Perceptual maps
                also reveal unclaimed space that may contain a target market. Marketers draw a line of best fit
                through the plots and look for places along the line that are uncontested. Also, items well above
                or well below the line may be over- or underserving customers and costing the firm money.
                Allstate for example may look decent at first glance, but they would have to significantly lower
                price or raise customer service to remain competitive. GEICO is possibly overserving customers
                on customer service; sure customers will accept this, but they probably would accept less and
                not run away based on still being above the “line of best fit.”
                     A perceptual map for Marriott is shown in Figure 7-12, illustrating how several of the firm’s
                hotel brands compare to or are differentiated from one another in terms of price and customer
                satisfaction. When implementing strategies, Marriott may use a perceptual map such as the one
                shown in Figure 7-12 to understand which of its individual brands are doing best, to identify
                potential problems with underperforming brands, or to visualize potential markets that could
                best serve as a focus for a new brand of Marriott hotels. For example, the addition of another
                mid-range hotel brand may cannibalize sales of existing Marriott brands, but the addition of an
                economy-brand of hotels may be fruitful for Marriott to consider as a means of implementing a
                growth strategy.

                                  Engage Customers in Social Media
                                  Social-media marketing has become an important strategic issue and an effective way to
                                  understand consumers’ perceptions of brands. Marketing has evolved to be more about build-
                                  ing a two-way relationship with consumers than just informing consumers about a product
                                  or service. Marketers increasingly strive to get customers involved in the company website
                                  and social-media pages and solicit suggestions in terms of product development, customer
                                  service, and ideas. Companies want customers to interact with the firm on such social-media
                                  networks as Facebook, Google Plus, Twitter, LinkedIn, Instagram, Pinterest, and Foursquare.
                                  To manage this process, many larger companies have hired social-media managers to be the
                                  face or voice of the company on social and digital media sites. These managers respond to
                                  comments and problems, track negative or misleading statements, manage the online dis-
                                  cussion about a firm, and gather valuable information about opinions and desires—all of
                                  which can be vital for monitoring ­strategy implementation progress and making appropriate
                                  changes.
                                      The online community of customers increasingly mirrors the offline community; online
                                  engagement can be a much quicker, cheaper, and effective source for gathering market research
                                  data than traditional focus groups and surveys. Successful strategy implementation requires a
                                  firm to know what people are saying about it and its products. Social-media posts, blog discus-
                                  sions, tweets, e-mails, and conversations with family and friends represent valuable content for
                                  brand management. The best firms today embrace consumers’ opinions, desires, and feelings,
                                  and learn from, and leverage consumer-generated content to improve the effectiveness of their
                                  marketing mix.
                                      Firms benefit immensely by providing incentives to customers to share their thoughts,
                                  opinions, and experiences on the company website. Firms should encourage customers to
                                  network among themselves on topics of their choosing on the company website. The company
                                  website must not be just about the company; it must be all about the customer, too. Offering
                                  points, discounts, or coupons on the website for customers who provide ideas, suggestions, or
                                  feedback can be helpful. Driving traffic to the company website and then keeping customers

                    Customers trust other customers’ opinions more than a company’s marketing pitch, and

                    Millennials spend more time weekly on the Internet than watching television, listening
               to the radio, and watching movies combined. Thus, social-media ads are often a better means
               of reaching younger customers than traditional yellow pages, television, magazine, radio, or
               newspaper ads. However, about 35 percent of all traffic on the Internet is reportedly fake, being
               the result of bogus computers programmed to visit websites to take advantage of marketers who
               typically pay for ads whenever a user visits a webpage, regardless if the user is an actual person.
               Criminals can erect websites and deliver phony traffic and collect payments from advertisers
               through middlemen, often in third-world countries. Although the exponential increase in social-
               media engagement has created huge opportunities for marketers, it also has produced severe
               threats; any kind of negative publicity travels fast online. Seemingly minor ethical and question-
               able actions can catapult into huge public relations problems for companies as a result of the
               monumental online social and business communications.

               Chapter Summary
               Successful strategy formulation does not at all guarantee successful strategy implementation.
               Although inextricably interdependent, strategy formulation and strategy implementation are
               characteristically different. In a single word, strategy implementation means change. It is widely
               agreed that the real work begins after strategies are formulated. Successful strategy implementa-
               tion requires the support of, as well as discipline and hard work from, motivated managers and
               employees. It is sometimes frightening to think that a single individual can irreparably sabotage
               strategy-implementation efforts.
                    Formulating the right strategies is not enough because managers and employees must be
               motivated to implement those strategies. Management issues considered central to strategy
               implementation include matching organizational structure with strategy, linking performance
               and pay to strategies, creating an organizational climate conducive to change, managing political
               relationships, creating a strategy-supportive culture, adapting production and operations pro-
               cesses, and managing human resources. Establishing annual objectives, devising policies, and
               allocating resources are central strategy-implementation activities common to all organizations.
               Depending on the size and type of the organization, other management issues could be equally
               important to successful strategy implementation. Similarly, depending on the size and type of
               firm, marketing issues, practices, and policies may vary, but effective segmentation, target mar-
               keting, and then positioning is required for organizational success.

                                  Compare and Contrast Coca-Cola’s Marketing
                                  Expenses versus Rival Firms
               Purpose
               Marketing is expensive. For example, a 30-second ad spot during the annual NFL Super Bowl costs
               about $5 million. Yet, firms must do marketing otherwise even the best products in the world can
               go unnoticed. But firms can go broke doing marketing. These are reasons why marketing is a key
               business function and an important issue in strategy implementation. This exercise can give you
               experience comparing and contrasting Coca-Cola’s marketing expenditures versus two major rivals:
               PepsiCo and Dr Pepper Snapple. Analysis in this regard can provide guidance on whether to increase
               or decrease Coca-Cola’s marketing expenditures.
               Instructions
               Step 1             Go online to Coca-Cola, PepsiCo, and Dr Pepper Snapple websites at the respective Investor
                                  Relations page and download the three Form 10Ks for the respective firms.
               Step 2             Look in the Table of Contents to each Form 10K to find the pages that reveal the three firms’
                                  marketing or advertising expenditures.
               Step 3             Prepare a comparative data table to consolidate this information.
               Step 4             Prepare a report to suggest implications for Coca-Cola in terms of marketing or advertising
                                  expenditures going forward as needed to implement strategies.

               Purpose
               Organizational structure matters because being well organized is vital for success in all aspects of
               business (and personal) endeavors. This exercise gives you experience developing an existing organi-
               zational chart for a company, and based on the chapter guidelines, proposing a new and improved de-
               sign for a firm. Rarely do companies publicly provide an organizational chart, but nearly all publicly
               held firms provide a list of their top executives in the annual Form 10K, as does Coca-Cola. Based on
               that document, Coca-Cola’s top management team is as follows:
                   1.   Muhtar Kent, Chairman of the Board of Directors and Chief Executive Officer
                   2.   Alexander M. Douglas, Jr., EVP and President of Coca-Cola North America
                   3.   Irial Finan, EVP and President, Bottling Investments Group
                   4.   John Murphy, President of the Asia Pacific Group

                                  Instructions
                                  Step 1         Develop an existing organizational chart for Coca-Cola. As described in the chapter, use
                                                 numbers in your chart rather than drawing boxes or circles. Always number executive posi-
                                                 tions as shown, so you can then use just numbers in your actual chart rather than drawing
                                                 boxes or circles to reveal reporting relationships.
                                  Step 2         Develop a new and improved organizational chart for Coca-Cola. You may want to change
                                                 up the list given, adding and deleting positions as you deem necessary as well as changing
                                                 certain titles to assure adherence to the chapter guidelines and dos and don’ts in devising

                                  The purpose of this exercise is to give you practice developing product-positioning maps. Nonprofit
                                  organizations, such as universities, increasingly use product-positioning maps to determine effective
                                  ways to implement strategies.

                                  As indicated in this chapter, establishing annual objectives and marketing products or services is
                                  vital for successful strategy implementation in companies, but these two activities are equally im-

               What Are the Most Important Benefits of Having a Diverse
               Workforce?
               Purpose
               Sometimes students, and even managers and executives, do not realize or appreciate why it is impor-
               tant to have a diverse workforce and management team. As discussed in this chapter, there are six
               major benefits of having a diverse workforce, as follows:

                   1. Women and minorities have different insights, opinions, and perspectives that should be
                      ­considered.
                   2. A diverse workforce portrays a firm committed to nondiscrimination.
                   3. A workforce that mirrors a customer base can help attract customers, build customer loyalty,
                       and design or offer products and services that meet customer needs and wants.
                   4. A diverse workforce helps protect the firm against discrimination lawsuits.
                   5. Women and minorities represent a huge additional pool of qualified applicants.
                   6. A diverse workforce strengthens a firm’s social responsibility and ethical position.

               The purpose of this exercise is to examine more closely the benefits of having a diverse workforce and
               management team. In addition, the purpose of this exercise is to examine whether individual decision
               making is better than group decision making. Academic research suggests that groups make better
               decisions than individuals about 80 percent of the time.
               Instructions
               Rank the six benefits of having a diverse workforce and management team as to their relative impor-
               tance (1 = most important, 9 = least important). First, rank the six benefits as an individual. Then, rank
               the six benefits as part a group of three. Thus, determine what person(s) and what group(s) here today
               can come closest to the expert ranking. This exercise enables examination of the relative effectiveness
               of individual versus group decision making in strategic planning.

                                                                    1. Fill in Column 1 in Table 7-15 to reveal your individual ranking of the relative importance of
                                                                       the six benefits (1 = most important to 6 = least important). For example, if you think Benefit #1
                                                                       (Women and minorities have different insights, opinions, and perspectives) is the second-most
                                                                       important benefit, then enter a 2 in Table 7-15 in Column 1 beside Benefit 1.
                                                                    2. Fill in Column 2 in Table 7-15 to reveal your group’s ranking of the relative importance of the

                                                                    3. Fill in Column 3 in Table 7-15 to reveal the expert’s ranking of the six benefits.
                                                                    4. Fill in Column 4 in Table 7-15 to reveal the absolute difference between Column 1 and Column
                                                                       3 to reveal how well you performed as an individual in this exercise. (Note: Absolute difference
                                                                       disregards negative numbers.)
                                                                    5. Fill in Column 5 in Table 7-15 to reveal the absolute difference between Column 2 and Column
                                                                       3 to reveal how well your group performed in this exercise.
                                                                    6. Sum Column 4. Sum Column 5.
                                                                    7. Compare the Column 4 sum with the Column 5 sum. If your Column 4 sum is less than your Column
                                                                       5 sum, then you performed better as an individual than as a group. Normally, group decision making
                                                                       is superior to individual decision making, so if you did better than your group, you did excellent.
                                                                    8. The Individual Winner(s): The individual(s) with the lowest Column 4 sum is the WINNER.
                                                                    9. The Group Winners(s): The group(s) with the lowest Column 5 score is the WINNER

               Q: What is your focus as CFO of De Beers since the firm has excellent finances?
               A: Mining contributes 75 percent of our business, but it is the rest of the business that helps us drive
                   consumer demand and maintain the value of the mining business. It is helpful for consumers to
                   understand diamonds in order to maintain their affinity with the product.
               Q: Why have you increased marketing spending and stepped up diamond advertising?
               A: Our marketing spurs consumer demand through our downstream (retail store) business, For-
                   evermark and De Beers Diamonds Jewelers, and through our sale of rough diamonds to the
                   mid-stream industry. “Desirability” is what drives sales of luxury goods, and with increased
                   competition from other luxury-good categories (such as designer handbags and shoes), we use
                   advertising to drive desirability for diamonds. De Beers has 30 retail stores across Asia, the U.S.,
                   Europe, and the Middle East.
               Q: How are you communicating the heritage of the De Beers brand to millennials?
               A: We know that millennials have fewer real connections with people (despite more online/vir-
                   tual connections), and these connections are more difficult to sustain. A diamond symbolizes
                   a lasting, valuable relationship between two people; similarly, a diamond is rare, timeless, and
                   valuable.
               Q: Millennials value experiences and goods with an interesting and authentic story; how are you
                   addressing this?
               A: We know that buying diamonds is an experience. We talk to customers about where diamonds
                   are from, how they are formed, and all the good that diamond mining has done to boost local
                   economies in Namibia and Botswana, educating young girls, investing in clean water, and even
                   helping preserve the white rhino.
               Q: What trends are you seeing in regards to women purchasing diamond jewelry for themselves?
               A: De Beers Diamond Jeweler has tailored its offerings to the strong, independent, often career
                   woman; this is a growing consumer segment. Aside from diamond engagement rings, other
                   diamond jewelry including rings, necklaces, and bracelets are actually often self-purchased.
                   Many self-purchases come from unmarried women that comprise 43 percent of all women in
                   the U.S.
               Q: How are you approaching e-commerce?
               A: Digital platforms are a useful way to educate consumers on diamonds. With the significant value
                   tied to diamond jewelry, the experience of buying is important. People remember how, when,
                   where, and why they purchased a diamond, so we try hard to make the process great.

                                                  trategies can be implemented successfully only when an organization manages its finances
                                                  effectively, as illustrated in Figure 8-1. This chapter examines important finance and ac-
                                                  counting topics associated with implementing strategies. An actual working example for
                                           Procter & Gamble (P&G) is provided to illustrate and explain key finance and accounting topics.
                                           A proposed set of P&G recommendations with associated costs is presented, followed by an
                                           EPS/EBIT analysis to determine the most appropriate means for raising capital, projected finan-
                                           cial statements to show the expected impact of those recommendations, and projected financial
                                           ratios. Corporate valuation is discussed, too, because firms sometimes acquire other firms or
                                           may be the target of an acquisition.
                                                Strategy implementation generally impacts the lives of everyone in an organization; thus,
                                           all employees need to buy in and support the firm’s efforts to succeed in the face of numerous
                                           rival firms counterattacking. When employees understand the thinking that goes into strategy
                                           formulation and understand their roles, they will be more inclined to accept the work required
                                           for strategy implementation.

    period of heightened regulatory and legally challenging environments.

    tance of involving others in decision making and (2) the importance of
    economies of scale.
          On the importance of people learning to work together, Dimon          firms should be careful not to venture into areas outside their corporate

                   A sampling of issues that may require finance and accounting policies, decisions, analyses,
               and actions in implementing strategies include the following:
                1. To raise capital with short- or long-term debt, a bond issuance, divestiture, or a preferred or
                   common stock issuance
                2. To lease or buy fixed assets
                3. To determine an appropriate dividend payout ratio
                4. To use last-in-first-out (LIFO), first-in-first-out (FIFO), or a market-value accounting
                   approach
                5. To extend the time of accounts receivable or not
                6. To establish a certain percentage discount on accounts within a specified period of time
                7. To determine the amount of cash to be kept on hand
                8. To purchase additional treasury stock or not
                9. To determine whether to accept a merger offer
               10. To determine how much to ask (or pay) for a division of the firm to be divested
                    Five especially important finance and accounting activities central to strategy implementa-
               tion are listed and discussed sequentially in this chapter:
                   1. Determine capital structure: acquire needed capital to implement strategies; perform EPS/
                      EBIT analysis.
                   2. Develop projected financial statements: show expected impact of recommendations.
                   3. Perform corporate valuation: in the event an offer is received or a rival firm is to be
                      acquired.
                   4. Analyze financial ratios.
                   5. Manage initial public offerings (IPOs), cash levels, and corporate bonds


               Capital Structure                                                                                     LO 8.1
               After developing a set of recommendations with associated costs (as explained in the prior chap-
               ter), a firm must determine the most profitable means for raising needed capital. Occasionally
               cash on hand can finance small projects, but much of the cash on a firm’s balance sheet may
               not be readily accessible without incurring taxes depending on what country the cash resides.
               Another way to raise the capital for new projects is to divest existing businesses. Jack Welsh,
               the former CEO of General Electric, was famous for divesting any business that was not first or
               second in its industry. P&G recently divested more than one hundred underperforming brands to
               cut costs, raise capital, and shift focus from underperforming brands into the firm’s core compe-
               tencies. Annual net income is also available for implementing strategies, but usually all debt, all
               stock, or some combination of debt and stock is necessary to implement a set of recommenda-
               tions. The proportion of debt to equity on a balance sheet is often referred to as a firm’s capital
               structure; performing an EPS/EBIT analysis is a common way to determine the appropriate
               capital structure needed.

                     Before explaining EPS/EBIT analysis, let’s be clear on some accounting terms as follows:

                   1. EPS is earnings per share, which is net income divided by number of shares outstanding.
                   2. EBIT is earnings before interest and taxes, or as it is sometimes called, operating income.
                   3. Shares outstanding is similar to shares issued except shares issued also includes shares of
                      stock that a firm has repurchased (treasury stock). The denominator of EPS is shares out-
                      standing; this number is reduced when a firm repurchases a portion of its own stock, thus
                      increasing the overall EPS value. Most large firms have treasury stock, but some do not,
                      such as Starbucks Corporation.
                   4. Shares authorized are the number of shares a firm has approval to issue in total, normally
                      considerably more than the number of shares outstanding.
                   5. EBT is earnings before tax; EAT is earnings after tax. Another term for earnings is profits
                      or net income.

    272    PART 3 • STRATEGY IMPLEMENTATION

                                                  Successful strategy implementation often requires additional capital beyond net income from
                                          o­ perations or the sale of assets. Two primary sources of capital are debt and equity. Determining an
                                           ­appropriate mix of debt and equity in a firm’s capital structure is an important ­strategy-implementation
                                            decision. EPS/EBIT analysis is a widely used technique for determining whether debt, stock,
                                            or a combination of the two is the best alternative for raising capital to implement strategies.
                                            This ­technique involves an examination of the impact that debt versus stock financing has on EPS
                                            under various expectations for EBIT, given specific recommendations (strategies to be implemented).
                                                  Theoretically, an enterprise should carry enough debt in its capital structure to boost its return
                                            on investment in projects earning more than the cost of the debt. In low-earning periods, excessive
                                            debt in the capital structure of an organization can endanger stockholders’ returns and jeopardize
                                            company survival. Fixed debt obligations must be met, regardless of circumstances, to avoid default.
                                            Avoiding debt obligations however does not automatically make financing through equity a more at-
                                            tractive means for raising capital. When the cost of capital (interest rates) is low, debt may be better
                                            than stock to obtain capital, but the analysis still must be performed because high stock prices usually
                                            accompany low interest rates, making stock issuances attractive for obtaining capital. Some special
                                            concerns with stock issuances include dilution of ownership, increased takeover risk, effect on stock
                                            price, the need to pay dividends on the additional shares if the firm pays dividends, and lower EPS.
                                                  EPS is perhaps the best measure of success of a company, so it is widely used in making the
                                            capital acquisition decision. EPS reflects the common “maximizing shareholders’ wealth” over-
                                          arching corporate objective, in contrast to maximizing profits in the short run. If profit maximi-
                                          zation is the primary objective of the firm, then in performing an EPS/EBIT analysis, you may
                                          focus more on the EAT rather than EPS.


                                          EPS/EBIT Analysis: Steps to Complete
                                          There are four steps to complete in performing EPS/EBIT analysis:
                                               Step 1: Gather the Input Data Needed; Determine the Following Numbers:
                                                        a. The dollar amount in capital the firm needs to raise = the total associated costs
                                                           of recommendations
                                                        b. Number of shares outstanding; usually given on a firm’s balance sheet
                                                        c. Interest rate (%) that funds can be borrowed (use 3 to 5 percent)
                                                        d. Tax rate (%) the firm is paying (calculated from a firm’s income statement; i.e.,
                                                           taxes or provision for taxes divided by EBT. (Note: in 2018 the US corporate
                                                           tax rate changed to 21 percent).
                                                        e. The dollar amount of EBIT range; use the most recent year EBIT number plus
                                                           or minus the impact of recommendations to determine a range; select a low,
                                                           medium, and high dollar amount of EBIT to simulate pessimistic, realistic, and
                                                           optimistic values for the year ahead.
                                               Step 2: Set Up a Computation Table as Follows

                                  b. For the $ Interest row, in the three All-Stock columns, place zeros because
                                      no new interest will be paid if the firm elects to use the All-Stock approach.
                                      In the interest row for the All-Debt columns, multiply the $ capital needed
                                      times the interest rate and place the resultant amount in the three All-Debt
                                      columns. Similarly, in the 50-50 Combo columns, multiply the $ capital
                                      needed (50% of total) times the interest rate and place the resultant amount
                                      in the 50-50 Combo columns. (Note: Change the percentage if using a differ-
                                      ent combination such as 70-30 stock-debt).
                                  c. For the $ EBT row, subtract row 2 from row 1, in each respective column.
                                  d. For the $ Taxes row, multiply row 3 by the tax percentage, in each respective
                                      column.
                                  e. For the $ EAT row, subtract row 4 from row 3, in each respective column.
                                  f. For the # Shares Issued row, in the three All-Stock columns, divide the $ capital
                                      needed by the stock price and add that number to the existing number of shares
                                      outstanding and place the resultant number in the All-Stock columns. In the
                                      three All-Debt columns, simply place the existing number of shares o­ utstanding
                                      number because no new shares are being added. In the three 50-50 Combo
                                      ­columns, multiply the $ capital needed by 50 percent; then divide this n­ umber
                                       by the stock price and add the resultant number to the existing number of
                                       shares outstanding to determine the number in the 50-50 Combo columns.
                                       (Note: Change the percentage if using a different mix of stock versus debt.)
                                  g. For the $ EPS row, divide row 5 by row 6, in each respective column. Take
                                       notice of which EPS values are highest along the row for each capital structure
                                       scenario. The highest EPS values reveal the best financing decision. If the EPS
                                       values are the same or nearly the same across the bottom row for the same level
                                       of EBIT, then the amount of funds raised may be too low to reveal significant
                                       differences based on the current interest rates or stock price, or the EBIT range
                                       may be too narrow. If you are recommending strategies that require high capital
                                       requirements, there should be differences in EPS values between All-Debt and
                                       All-Stock for the same level of EBIT.
                    Step 4:       Graph Your EPS/EBIT Analysis
                                  Simply place the top row ($ EBIT) on the x-axis and place the bottom row ($ EPS)
                                  on the y-axis. Then, plot three resultant lines for All-Stock, All-Debt, and 50-50
                                  Stock-Debt Combo, respectively. The highest line in the graph reveals the highest
                                  EPS that maximizes shareholder value; select this highest EPS financing option
                                  unless you have a compelling reason(s) to overturn this decision as per limitations
                                  of this analysis discussed in Table 8-3.

               EPS/EBIT Analysis: An Example
               Perhaps the best way to explain EPS/EBIT analysis is by working through an example for P&G,
               examining the All-Stock, All-Debt, and 60-40 Stock-Debt Combo financing alternatives. Following
               Steps 1 to 3, the needed input data and computations are given in Tables 8-1 and 8-2, respectively.

                                       Note when EBIT is forecasted as pessimistic, then equity financing is more attractive than
                                  debt financing, as indicated by the EPS value of $2.96 compared to the debt financing EPS
                                  value of $2.94. However, as the economy or projected EBIT improves, All-Debt financing will
                                  maximize P&G’s EPS, as revealed by a $5.36 EPS for All Debt versus a $5.32 EPS for All-Stock
                                  financing. Our conclusion is that P&G should use stock to raise capital under the pessimistic
                                  forecast, but if the economy is forecasted to be realistic or optimistic, then debt is the most at-
                                  tractive financing alternative.
                                       Following Step 4, a graph of the P&G EPS/EBIT analysis is given in Figure 8-2. The in-
                                  tersection points near the $15,000 level of EBIT are break-even points where one method of
                                  financing becomes more attractive than another. Note at the $10,000 level of EBIT, All-Stock
                                  yields the highest EPS, and at the $18,000 level, All-Debt financing yields the highest EPS. So,
                                  the analyst is faced with a decision regarding what to recommend based on his or her confidence
                                  levels for the EBIT ranges and the limitations discussed in Table 8-3.

               TABLE 8-3 Limitations/Considerations Associated with EPS/EBIT Analysis

                    1. Flexibility. As a firm’s capital structure changes, so does its flexibility for considering
                       future capital needs. Using all debt or all stock to raise capital today may impose fixed
                       obligations, restrictive covenants, or other constraints tomorrow that could reduce or
                       enhance a firm’s ability to raise additional capital.
                    2. Dilution of Ownership. When additional stock is issued to finance strategy imple-
                       mentation, ownership and control of the enterprise are diluted. This can be a serious
                       concern in today’s business environment of hostile takeovers, mergers, and acquisitions.
                       If dilution of ownership is a concern, then debt could be more attractive than stock, even
                       if EPS values are higher with stock.
                    3. Timing. If interest rates are expected to rise, then debt may be more attractive than
                       stock (assuming a fixed rate is locked in), even if EPS values are higher with stock. In
                       times of high stock prices, stock may more attractive than debt.
                    4. Leveraged Situation. If the firm is currently too highly leveraged versus industry av-
                       erage ratios, then financing through stock may be more attractive than debt, even if EPS
                       values are higher for debt.
                    5. Continuity. The analysis assumes stock price, tax rate, and interest rates stay constant
                       across pessimistic, realistic, and optimistic conditions.
                    6. EBIT Ranges. The EBIT values are estimated based on the prior year, plus the impact
                       of strategies to be implemented.
                    7. Dividends. If EPS values are highest for all stock, and if the firm pays dividends, then
                       more funds will leave the firm as per dividends if all-stock financing is selected.



                    Be mindful that large companies may have millions of shares outstanding, so even small
               differences in EPS across different financing options, such as in this example, can equate to
               large sums of money gained by using that highest EPS value alternative. For example, P&G
               has 2,550 million shares outstanding, so the $0.04 difference you see in EPS at the $18,000
               level translates into 2,550 × 0.04 = $102 million in potential monies that P&G would have if
               the firm uses debt financing (DF) over common stock financing (CSF) at the $18,000 level
               of EBIT.
                    Any number of combination stock/debt (S/D) scenarios, such as 70/30 S/D or 30/70 S/D,
               may be examined in an EPS/EBIT analysis to determine expected EPS values. The free Excel
               template at www.strategyclub.com enables easy calculation of various financing options.

               EPS/EBIT Analysis: Limitations
               All analytical tools have limitations, including EPS/EBIT analysis. But unless you have a com-
               pelling reason to overturn the highest last row EPS values dictating the best financing option,
               then indeed those highest values along the bottom row should dictate the financing decision
               because EPS is an excellent measure of organizational performance, and thus is an excellent
               variable to examine in deciding which financing option to use. EPS/EBIT analysis itself does not
               alert the analyst of potential limitations discussed in Table 8-3.

               Projected financial statements are income statements and balance sheets developed for
               future years to forecast the potential impacts of various recommendations proposed for imple-
               mentation. Recall from Chapter 6 that all recommendations carry with them an estimated cost
               value. Most financial institutions require 3 years of projected financial statements whenever
               a business seeks capital. On financial statements, different companies use different terms for
               various items. For example, revenues or sales can refer to the same item; net income, earn-
               ings, or profits can refer to the same item; capital surplus or paid-in-capital can refer to the
               same item. A term sometimes used for retained earnings is accumulated equity or (if losses)
               accumulated deficit.

                                             The Free Excel Strategic Planning Template at www.strategyclub.com
                                             Many practitioners and students of strategic planning use the template to develop existing and
                                             projected financial statements to reveal the expected impact of proposed recommendations for
                                             the firm. Do not expect the template to do the thinking for you in terms of projecting each row
                                             on both the income statements and balance sheets. The template does the calculating for you but
                                             you must supply the thinking regarding the amount to alter each row given the expected impact
                                             of your recommendations. For anyone using the template to develop actual and projected finan-
                                             cial statements, Table 8-4 provides author comments.


    TABLE 8-4 Template Considerations in Developing Financial Statements

      Almost every row of the template’s projected financial statements is to be forecasted by the user to reveal the expected impact of his or her rec-
      ommendations for the firm. However, a few rows in the template’s projected statements are automatically calculated (rather than forecasted) as
      discussed below.
          1. Make Conversion. Convert (enter) your firm’s most recent Form 10K actual income statements and balance sheets into the template-
             formatted statements. Doing this will greatly facilitate development of projected financial statements and ratios. In making this conver-
             sion, use the nonrecurring events row to house extraneous items on the income statements; on the balance sheets, use the other current
             or long-term assets, the other current or long-term liabilities rows.
          2. Income Statements. Use the nonrecurring events row to adjust for divesting a division or any other extraneous events in order for your
             firm’s Form 10K revenues, cost of goods sold, operating expenses, and net income to match perfectly with the template statement. If
             having an issue with EBIT perfectly matching the Form 10K, simply subtract EBIT from Gross Profit on the Form 10K and enter this
             number for Operating Expenses. This procedure will ensure your template EBIT matches the EBIT from your firm’s Form 10K because
             sometimes the Operating Expenses line is difficult to transfer over perfectly; it is okay if your template Operating Expenses do not per-
             fectly match the Form 10K as long as EBIT does. Net income is automatically calculated from your other income statement forecasts, so
             the net income row is not forecasted.
          3. Retained Earnings (RE) Row. The RE row on the template projected balance sheets is automatically calculated because the RE row is
             determined by carrying over the net income less dividends annually from the income statement to the RE row near the bottom of the
             balance sheet.
          4. Balance Sheets. Work row-by-row from the bottom to the top making changes as needed to reflect the impact of your recommendations
             on each row. Leave forecasted items and rows the same as the prior year if you expect no change in that row given your recommenda-
             tions. The template has a note to the right of each row to aid in how to enter the numbers. Get the total liabilities plus stockholders’
             equity number, then transfer that number to the total assets row, and then move further upward towards the cash row forecasting each
             item/row given your recommendations.
          5. Cash. The template uses the balance sheet cash row as a plug figure to make the projected balance sheet balance, so this row is auto-
             matically calculated. Often the cash figure will be abnormally high after forecasting all other rows; in this situation make appropriate
             adjustments in the liability or equity sections, usually using the long-term-debt or paid-in-capital rows, to offset the amount you increase
             or decrease the cash row to keep liquidity in line with industry averages. Making adjustments, even to other items on the balance sheet,
             is good practice and routinely done by all accountants, so do not feel you are cheating the system until you get the numbers reasonable.
             Projected statements are a good-faith estimate, and a high cash figure only indicates other estimates need to be reconsidered. Also,
             check for typos or miscalculations on both the projected income statement and balance sheet. For example, it is possible you are over- or
             underestimating the 1) revenue impacts of your recommendations or 2) the amount of capital you need to implement your recommenda-
             tions. Also, experiment with adjusting the historical percentages on both asset and liability items such as accounts payable or accounts
             receivable; it is possible the historical number needs to be increased on asset line items or decreased on liability items if the firm is oper-
             ating more efficiently, and the result will bring cash down. Also, double check plant property and equipment because a high cash figure
             may indicate you are underestimating how much these assets will cost. Once you make one change, revaluate the cash figure on the new
             projected balance sheet and continue until you find the cash number reasonable. Accountants do this all the time, striving for excellent,
             reasonable, truthful projected statements. Ethics Capsule 8 and Global Capsule 8 address the truthfulness or reasonableness aspect of
             projected financial statements.
          6. Financial Ratios. The template will automatically calculate actual and forecasted financial ratios once income statement and balance
             sheet data are entered. When compared to prior years and industry averages, financial ratios provide valuable insights for implementing
             strategies. (Financial ratios were discussed in Chapter 4.)

    278    PART 3 • STRATEGY IMPLEMENTATION

                                  Steps to Develop Projected Financial Statements
                                  Whether you use the free, Excel strategic-planning template, projected financial statement
                                  analysis can be explained in seven steps:
                                      Step 1.         repare the projected income statement before the balance sheet. Start by
                                                     P
                                                     forecasting sales (revenues) as accurately as possible to reveal the expected
                                                     impact of recommendations being implemented. In forecasting revenues, do
                                                     not ­blindly push historical revenue growth percentages into the future without
                                                     considering ventures the firm undertook in prior years to achieve those results.
                                                     What a firm did previously to achieve those past sales increases may or may
                                                     not be appropriate for the future, depending on whether your recommendations
                                                     take similar or analogous actions (e.g., such as opening a similar number of
                                                     stores). If dealing with a manufacturing firm, also be mindful that if the firm is
                                                     operating at 100 percent capacity running three 8-hour shifts per day, then prob-
                                                     ably new manufacturing facilities (land, plant, and equipment) will be needed
                                                     to increase sales further.
                                      Step 2.   Use the percentage-of-sales method to project cost of goods sold (COGS) and the
                                                 Operating Expenses in the income statement. For example, if COGS is 50 percent
                                                 of sales in the prior year (as it is in Table 8-5), then use a similar percentage to
                                                 calculate COGS in the future year—unless there is a reason to use a different per-
                                                 centage. Items such as interest, dividends, and taxes must be treated independently
                                                 and cannot be forecasted using the percentage-of-sales method.
                                      Step 3.    Calculate the projected net income (NI).
                                      Step 4.      Subtract from the NI any dividends to be paid. The remaining NI is retained earn-
                                                    ings (RE). Bring the RE amount over to the balance sheet by adding it to the prior
                                                    year’s RE amount on the balance sheet. In other words, every year, a firm adds its
                                                    RE (which is NI – Dividends for that particular year) to its historical RE total on
                                                    the balance sheet. Therefore, the RE amount on the balance sheet is a cumulative
                                                    number rather than money available for strategy implementation. Note that RE is
                                                    the first projected balance sheet item to be entered. As a result of this accounting
                                                    procedure in developing projected financial statements, the RE amount on the
                                                    balance sheet is usually a large number; it is a cumulative number of dollars rein-
                                                    vested into the company over many years; it is not cash in the bank; it can be a low
                                                    or even negative number if the firm has been incurring losses or paying dividends
                                                    that exceed NI. In fact, the most common ways for RE to decrease from one year
                                                    to the next on the balance sheet is (1) if the firm incurred an earnings loss that year
                                                    or (2) the firm had positive NI for the year but paid out dividends in excess of the
                                                    net income. Be mindful that RE is the key link between a projected income state-
                                                    ment and projected balance sheet, so be careful to make this calculation correctly.
                                      Step 5.     Project the balance sheet items working from the bottom to the top; begin with the
                                                   RE row; if using the template, the RE number is calculated automatically based on
                                                   the amount of dividends paid; then forecast the remaining equity items, followed
                                                   by forecasting the long-term liabilities, current liabilities, long-term assets, and
                                                   current assets (in that order), working from the bottom to the top.
                                      Step 6.       Use cash as the plug figure—that is, project every line item on the projected
                                                     balance except cash (and RE); use the cash account to make the assets equal to
                                                     the sum of the liabilities and shareholders’ equity. Then make appropriate adjust-
                                                     ments. For example, if the cash needed to balance the statements is too small
                                                     (or too large), considering making appropriate changes to borrow more (or less)
                                                     money than planned and reevaluate line items such as inventory, accounts receiv-
                                                     able, plant property and equipment and/or other asset lines. For example, if cash
                                                     is too high, (1) consider paying off some long-term debt; (2) reevaluate the pro-
                                                     jected percentage increase of various liabilities because it is possible the firm may
                                                     be operating more efficiently or have greater economies of scale, or (3) increase
                                                     your treasury stock. Rarely is the cash account number perfect on the first pass-
                                                     through, so adjustments are needed and made.

                                  why significant changes were made on particular items or rows in one year versus
                                  the next. Notes are essential for a reader to understand the changes made on certain
                                  rows. The template does not prepare notes because notes reflect your thinking re-
                                  garding the impact of your recommendations and your associated costs.

               Nonprofit Organizations
               The steps outlined for preparing projected financial statements apply equally to nonprofit or-
               ganizations; prepare the projected income statements first then the projected balance sheets.
               Since nonprofits never pay dividends, simply add the nonprofit’s net income (usually called Net
               Assets) to their balance sheet retained earnings row (usually called Net Assets). If the cash ac-
               count is too high or too low, just make adjustments as needed to the nonprofit’s assets or liabili-
               ties sections of the balance sheets, since there is no equity section (except for Net Assets). So,
               the projected financial statement steps/process (and template steps/process) is equally applicable
               for both for-profit firms and nonprofit organizations. Of course, taxes paid by nonprofits is zero,
               and there is zero paid-in-capital, treasury stock, and common stock.

               P&G’s Actual Financial Statements
               To further explain projected financial statement analysis, let’s work through an actual example for
               P&G. P&G’s actual income statement and balance sheets for 2016 and 2017 are given in Table 8- 6
               and Table 8-7, respectively. Notice that P&G’s actual Form 10K statements are converted or
               condensed into the “template format.” (Note: About 95% percent of all s­trategic-management
               students using this textbook, as well as thousands of corporate practitioners, use this template for
               doing strategic planning and developing projected financial statements; if you use it put on your
               resume that you “gained experience using strategic-planning software.”)
                    Notice in Tables 8-6 and 8-7 that P&G’s actual Form 10K revenues declined in 2017 and
               their current ratio (current assets divided by current liabilities) was less than 1.0. Thus, let’s pro-
               pose that P&G go forward with the following four recommendations with associated costs and
               comments; then we follow the impact of the costs on the firm’s projected financial statements:
                   1. Five new plants will be built in each of the three forecasted years (2018, 2019, 2020) at
                      $250 million each ($1,250 million per year attributed to plant, property, and equipment)
                      with adjustments to long-term debt and paid in capital, as described in # 4 below.
                   2. Raise an additional $1,250 million to finance research and development (R&D) and new

                                      $2,000 + $3,000 = $5,000, which is the total cost of recommendations not considering
                                      dividends.
                                       Note on P&G’s actual income statements in Table 8-6 the large increase in nonrecurring
                                  events in 2017; this change was because of the company divesting various businesses to stream-
                                  line the firm and better align its activities with its mission. Divestitures explain much of the large
                                  increase in P&G net income for fiscal 2017 and the large increase in retained earnings on the
                                  balance sheet. Without further similar divestitures moving forward, net income will decline the
                                  following year, whereas revenues actually increase. This example illustrates the importance of
                                  studying the Annual Report to determine what likely caused the changes in the current financial
                                  statements; then carefully consider how your recommendations will impact the projected state-
                                  ments. Simply pushing forward historical numbers on every line item is a common mistake in
                                  projected financial statement development.

               companies have been aggressively buying their own stock, reflecting optimism about their
               future. However, some analysts argue that stock buybacks eat cash that a firm could better use
               to grow the firm. Stock buybacks do however reduce a firm’s number of shares outstanding,
               thus increasing EPS; so firms reap this “intangible benefit” with stock buybacks. Sometimes
               firms will even increase their Treasury Stock near the end of the quarter, or near the end of the
               year, to “artificially” inflate their EPS to meet/beat EPS projections to perhaps avoid a stock
               price decline. This may be why Home Depot, in 2017–2018, bought back $15 billion of its
               stock, Honeywell bought $8 billion of its shares, Bank of America bought back $17 billion
               in stock, Mastercard repurchased $4 billion of its common shares, and T-Mobile began a $1.5
               billion buyback.
                    Note on P&G’s actual balance sheets in Table 8-7 that more than 50 percent of total assets
               are in the form of goodwill and intangibles; some financial experts suggest these items to be
               simply “smoke” because they are not physical assets that can easily be transferred into cash.
               P&G’s history of acquiring firms for over book value (market capitalization value) is the reason
               for the firm’s large goodwill values.

               P&G’s Projected Financial Statements
               Table 8-8 and Table 8-9 reveal P&G’s projected income statements and balance sheets, re-
               spectively, given the four recommendations with associated costs listed previously and the
               annual retained earnings carried forward to the projected balance sheet. Note, on the projected
               income statement in Table 8-8 both projected revenues and net income are increasing, but
               projected net income is down significantly from the prior year, largely because (as mentioned)
               there are no major divestitures (recorded as nonrecurring events on the income statement) in
               any projected years.

               As indicated in the prior pages, the key link between a projected income statement and balance
               sheet is the annual transfer of a firm’s net income less dividends = retained earnings (RE) to the
               firm’s balance sheet. In light of the importance of this transaction, a P&G RE data table given
               in Table 8-11 on page 284 shows specifically how this annual transfer of money is made.

                                  LO 8.3   Corporate Valuation
                                           Evaluating the worth of a business is central to strategy implementation because firms acquire
                                           other firms, divisions of other firms, or even divest part of their own firm. Thus, thousands of
                                           transactions occur each year in which businesses are bought or sold for some dollar amount in
                                           the United States and around the world. In fact, about $1.5 trillion in mergers are consummated
                                           in the United States annually. For example, CVS Healthcare is trying to buy Aetna Inc. and Walt
                                           Disney is trying to buy a segment of 21st Century Fox. In all such cases, it is necessary to estab-
                                           lish the financial worth or cash value of a business to successfully implement strategies.
                                                 Corporate valuation is not an exact science; value is sometimes in the eye of the beholder.
                                           Companies desire to sell high and buy low, and negotiation normally takes place in both situa-
                                           tions. The valuation of a firm’s worth is based on financial facts, but common sense and good
                                           judgment enter into the process because it is difficult to assign a monetary value to some
                                           factors—such as a loyal customer base, a history of growth, legal suits pending, dedicated
                                           employees, a favorable lease, a bad credit rating, or valuable patents—that may not be fully
                                           reflected in a firm’s financial statements. Also, different valuation methods will yield different
                                           totals for a firm’s worth. Evaluating the worth of a business truly requires both qualitative and
                                           quantitative skills.
                                                 With the recent merger and acquisition boom, S&P 500 firms experienced a 70 percent in-
                                           crease in goodwill from $1.7 trillion in 2007 to more than $3 trillion in 2017. For example, with
                                           the acquisition of SAB Miller, Anheuser-Busch InBev recently increased its goodwill to $141
                                           billion, up from $65 billion just 18 months prior, currently accounting for over 50 percent of
                                           total assets. Sometimes it is OK to pay more for a company than its book value (market capital-
                                           ization = number of shares outstanding : stock price) if the firm has technology or patents you
                                           need or economies of scale you desire, possibly to gain a better hold on distribution or even to
                                           reduce competitive pricing pressure, as in the Anheuser example. However, buying a company
                                           is like buying a house in that paying a “premium” (defined as the amount of money paid for an
                                           acquisition over the market capitalization amount) is usually not financially prudent.
                                                 In addition to preparing to buy or sell a business, corporate valuation analysis is often
                                           performed when dealing with the following finance and accounting issues: bank loans, tax
                                           calculations, retirement packages, death of a principal, partnership agreements, and IRS audits.
                                           Practically, it is just good business to know what your firm is worth. This knowledge protects the
                                           interests of all parties involved. To estimate the value of a division or segment of a firm, some
                                           analysts calculate the total corporate value and multiply that number by the percentage of rev-
                                           enues the division contributes to the firm.

                                           Corporate Valuation Methods
                                           There are numerous methods to determine the worth of a company, but four methods are most
                                           often used, as described:
                                           METHOD 1      The Net Worth Method = Shareholders’ Equity (SE) - (Goodwill + Intangibles)
                                           Other terms for SE are Owners’ Equity, Total Equity, or Net Worth, but this line item near
                                           the bottom of a balance sheet represents the sum of common stock, additional paid-in capital,
                                           retained earnings, treasury stock, and other equity items. After calculating total SE, subtract
                                           goodwill and intangibles if these items appear as assets on the firm’s balance sheet. Whereas
                                           intangibles include copyrights, patents, and trademarks, goodwill arises when a firm acquires

               another firm and pays more than the book value for that firm. Note in Table 8-12 that P&G’s
               goodwill + intangibles exceeds the firm’s SE, resulting in a negative valuation. As a result,
               Method 1 is not likely a good indicator of P&G’s market value; however it should raise concern
               for shareholders, managers, and potential firms looking to acquire P&G that most of the firm’s
               assets are intangible in nature.

               METHOD 2      The Net Income Method 5 Net Income : Five
               The second approach for measuring the monetary value of a company grows out of the belief that
               the worth of any business should be based largely on the future benefits its owners may derive
               through net profits. A conservative rule of thumb is to establish a business’s worth as five times
               the firm’s current annual profit. A 5-year average profit level could also be used. When using this
               approach, remember that firms may suppress earnings in their financial statements to minimize
               taxes. Note in Table 8-12 that Method 2 results in a low corporate valuation. If you were acquir-
               ing a business, this might be a good first offer, but likely Method 2 does not produce a value you
               would want to begin with if you are selling your business. If a firm’s net income is negative,
               theoretically Method 2 would imply that the firm would pay you to acquire them. Of course,
               when you acquire another firm, you obtain all of the firm’s debt and liabilities, so theoretically
               this would be possible. In general, this method is more feasible for small business evaluation.

               METHOD 3      Price-Earnings Ratio Method 5 (Stock Price , EPS) : NI
               To use the price-earnings ratio method, divide the market price of the firm’s common stock by
               the annual EPS and multiply this number by the firm’s average net income for the past 5 years.
               Notice in Table 8-12 this method yields an answer the same as Method 4. Algebraically, this
               method is identical to Method 4, if earnings and number of shares figures are taken at the same
               point in time. In Table 8-12, P&G’s actual fiscal year-end 2017 net income was used as opposed
               to a 5-year average.
               METHOD 4      Outstanding Shares Method 5 Number of Shares Outstanding : Stock Price
               To use the outstanding shares method, simply multiply the number of shares outstanding
               by the market price per share. If the purchase price is higher than this amount, the additional
               dollars are called a premium. The outstanding shares method may also be called the market
               value or market capitalization or book value of the firm. The premium is a per-share dollar
               amount that a person or firm is willing to pay beyond the book value of the firm to control
               (acquire) the other company. If you pay less for a firm than the market cap number, the differ-
               ence is called a discount.
                    The owner of Better Home & Gardens, Meredith Corp., recently paid a 46 percent premium
               dollar amount of $1.85 billion to acquire Time Inc. Meredith is based in Des Moines, Iowa. Time
               Inc. owns Fortune, People, and Sports Illustrated.

                                                A corporate valuation analysis by researcher Ryan Brewer was recently reported by several
                                           media outlets to reveal the monetary value of the top 20 college football programs. A summary
                                           of the resultant numbers is provided in Table 8-13; the numbers may have been derived by dis-
                                           counting future revenue streams back to the present to obtain a present value; this is another cor-

                                           (SEC) leads all conferences with 9 of the top 20 most valuable teams.

                                           Financial Ratio Analyses
                                           Introduced in Chapter 4, financial ratios are an important tool used to access a firm’s financial
                                           situation at one point in time. Financial ratios are examined based on (1) how they change over
                                           time, (2) how they compare to industry norms, and (3) how they compare with key competitors.
                                           Financial ratios based on actual financial statements reveal strengths and weaknesses of the firm;
                                           ratios based on projected financial statements reveal potential problems and successes likely
                                           to occur if a particular set of recommendations is implemented. For example, if a current ratio
                                           skyrockets or plummets versus industry averages, then cash (and other short-term assets) must
                                           be managed.
                                                Continuing with our P&G example, Tables 8-14 and 8-15, respectively, reveal the company’s
                                           actual (historical) and projected financial ratios, both calculated using the template. Comparing the
                                           actual to the projected leverage and activity ratios do not indicate any serious abnormalities or
                                           changes, suggesting the four recommendations to be implemented indeed are feasible and doable.
                                           Note a significant drop in P&G’s return on equity (ROE) and return on assets (ROA) ratios from
                                           2017 in the projected years because P&G’s divestitures ceased in 2017–2020. It is important to
                                           note, the projected ratios for P&G in Table 8-15 were not derived on the first attempt at creating

               Go Public with an IPO?
               Hundreds of companies annually hold initial public offerings (IPOs) to move from being
               private to being public. “Going public” means selling off a percentage of a company to oth-
               ers to raise capital; this action dilutes the owners’ control of the firm. Going public is not

                                            recommended for companies with less than $10 million in sales because the initial costs can be
                                            too high for the firm to generate sufficient cash flow to make going public worthwhile. One dol-
                                            lar in four is the average total cost paid to lawyers, accountants, and underwriters when an initial
                                            stock issuance is less than $1 million; $1 in $20 will go to cover these costs for issuances more
                                            than $20 million. In addition to initial costs involved with a stock offering, there are costs and
                                            obligations associated with reporting and management in a publicly held firm. The new equity
                                            capital derived from going public can enable firms to develop new products, build plants, re-

                                            gous to going to the bank and borrowing money, except that with bonds, the company obtains
                                            the funds from investors rather than banks. On a balance sheet, bonds are included in the long-
                                            term debt row. Especially when a company’s balance sheet is strong and its credit rating excel-
                                            lent, issuing bonds can be an effective way to raise needed capital. Corporate bond prices are
                                            less sensitive to daily or quarterly firm operations compared to stock prices. For example, an ex-
                                            pected equity price forecasted to finance potential recommended strategies may be significantly
                                            higher or lower than forecasted, but bond prices and rates will be more in line with the forecast
                                            based on unforeseen events such as CEO succession, new competitor emerging, bad earnings
                                            surprise, and other factors. Smaller firms or firms with negative earnings will also likely have
                                            higher rates associated with their bonds, possibly resulting in issuing bonds (debt) to be a more
                                            expensive alternative than equity. Bonds are also used because sometimes banks do not want to
                                            lend money for long periods of time to fund business operations.
                                                 The year 2017 was the seventh straight year that a record dollar value of bonds was sold
                                            in the United States, totaling more than $1.5 trillion. A large recent transaction was Anheuser-
                                            Busch InBev’s $46 billion bond issuance to purchase SAB Miller. Firms issue bonds to (1)
                                            finance acquisitions, (2) buy back their own stock (called treasury stock), (3) refinance old debt,
                                            and (4) raise cash to finance strategic initiatives. With the Federal Reserve in the United States
                                            slowly raising rates, bond issuances may level off.
                                                 The practice of firms issuing bonds to buy back their own stock and to pay cash dividends
                                            to shareholders has become a concern in terms of being financially prudent. A strategic decision
                                            facing corporations therefore, is whether to issue bonds to raise capital to pacify shareholders
                                            with cash dividends and purchase company stock, or to issue bonds to finance strategies care-
                                            fully formulated to yield greater revenues and profits.

                                        Chapter Summary
                                        Finance and accounting managers must devise effective strategy-implementation approaches at
                                        low cost and minimum risk to the firm. The nature and role of finance and accounting activities,
                                        coupled with the management and marketing activities described in the prior chapter, largely
                                        determine organizational success. An excellent capital structure can be a competitive advantage;
                                        EPS/EBIT analysis is needed to make capital structure decisions. Projected financial state-
                                        ments are vital for anticipating the impact of various recommendations. Corporate valuation
                                        methods are used all the time to acquire, merge, divest, and manage a firm’s finances. Together
                                        these finance concepts, tools, and techniques can help assure effective and efficient strategy
                                        implementation.

                                  This exercise is designed to give you experience preparing projected financial statements. This analy-
                                  sis is a strategic finance and accounting issue because it allows managers to anticipate and evaluate
                                  the expected results of various strategy-implementation approaches.
                                  Instructions
                                  Step 1         Work with a classmate. Develop a projected income statement and balance sheet for Coca-
                                                 Cola. Use the template if possible. Assume that Coca-Cola needs to raise $1 billion to in-

                                                 financing from a stock issuance. Make other assumptions as needed, and state them clearly
                                                 in written form.
                                  Step 2         Bring your projected statements to class and discuss any problems or questions you
                                                 encountered.
                                  Step 3         Compare your projected statements to the statements of other students. What major differ-

                                  Purpose
                                  It is simply good business to continually know the cash value (corporate valuation) of your
                                  company. This exercise gives you practice in determining the total worth of a company using
                                  several methods. To perform this analysis, use Coca-Cola’s financial statements as given in the
                                  Cohesion Case.
                                  Instructions
                                  Step 1         Calculate the financial worth of Coca-Cola based on four approaches: (1) the net worth
                                                 method, (2) the net income method, (3) the price-earnings ratio method, and (4) the out-
                                                 standing shares method.
                                  Step 2         Get an average of the four methods. In a dollar amount, how much is Coca-Cola worth?
                                  Step 3         Compare your analyses and conclusions with those of other students.

                                                 for Coca-Cola
                                  Purpose
                                  Financial ratios are vastly more than just an exercise for students to perform. If any firm’s financial
                                  ratios get out of line with industry average or decline over time, investors can withdraw support liter-
                                  ally overnight. Projected financial ratios are an excellent means for anticipating financial results so as
                                  to avoid overnight calamities. The template will generate projected financial ratios after you convert
                                  your firm’s financial statements to the template format and then develop projected financial state-
                                  ments based on recommended strategies.
                                  Step 1         Review the results of your EXERCISE 8B
                                  Step 2         Compute Coca-Cola’s projected current ratio, debt-to-equity ratio, and return-on-investment
                                                 ratio. How do your projected ratios compare to prior year ratios? Why is it important to
                                                 make this comparison?

               EXERCISE 8E

               Determine the Cash Value of My University
               Purpose
               It is simply good business to continually know the cash value (corporate valuation) of any organiza-
               tion, including colleges and universities. The four largest private universities in the United States
               by on-campus number of undergraduate students (in parentheses) are as follows: Brigham Young
               University (30,500), New York University (28,500), University of Southern California (19,000), and
               Northeastern University (17,500). This exercise gives you practice in determining the total worth of
               an organization using two methods.
               Instructions
               Step 1             Locate your university’s most recent income statement and balance sheet.
               Step 2             Calculate the financial worth of your university based on two approaches: (1) the net worth
                                  method and (2) the net income method.
               Step 3             Get an average of the two methods. In a dollar amount, how much is your university worth?

               Developing Personal Financial Statements
               Purpose
               Banks require individuals to develop personal financial statements whenever a mortgage or loan is requested.
               Managing your personal finances is important before and after you begin working full-time. This exercise
               gives you a heads up on the process of developing an income statement and balance sheet for yourself.
               Instructions
               Step 1             Develop an income statement and balance sheet for yourself using the free Excel template at
                                  www.strategyclub.com. Follow the steps outlined in this chapter.
               Step 2             Determine your net worth = your total assets minus your total liabilities.

               EXERCISE 8G

               A Template Competency Test
               Purpose
               The free Excel strategic planning template at www.strategyclub.com is widely used for strategic
               planning by students and small businesses; this exercise aims to enhance your familiarity with the
               template. Developing competence with the template will enable you to place this skill appropriately
               on your resume, in addition to facilitating your development of a comprehensive strategic plan for an
               assigned case company.

               Instructions
               Answer the following questions about the template. Discuss your answers with classmates to deter-
               mine any issues or concerns.
                   1. Why is it important to take the time to enter your financial statements into the template format
                      rather than simply copying and pasting financial statements off line with respect to the template?
                   2. Does this chapter focus on Part I or Part II of the template?
                   3. If the EPS ranges for equity and debt for a given level of EBIT are identical, what change in the
                      analysis would likely provide the most variance: (1) Adjusting the amount of capital needed by
                      25%, (2) increasing the interest rate by 1% (100 basis points), or (3) increasing the tax rate by
                      5% (500 basis points)? Why?

                                   4. Which of the following methods will never maximize EPS? (1) 100% equity financing, (2)
                                      100% debt financing, or (3) combination financing? Why?
                                   5. Explain how analyzing projected financial ratios generated by the template can be helpful in
                                      making adjustments to your projected financial statement estimates?
                                   6. Do you physically have to calculate any number on the projected statements when using the
                                      template?
                                   7. The template assures your projected balance sheets are in balance every time by using what line
                                      item to achieve the balancing?
                                   8. If you notice your current ratio went from a historical 1.0 to a projected 5.0, what are some
                                      steps you should consider taking?
                                   9. When entering treasury stock on the template, why do you enter a negative number?
                                  10. If you desire to quit paying dividends in projected years, what entry is needed for the template
                                      to make this calculation?
                                  11. If current plant property and equipment were $500 million and you wish to increase plant prop-
                                      erty and equipment by $50 million in the first fiscal year, what number would you enter into
                                      Part II of the template by plant property equipment under the first projected fiscal year?
                                  12. If you sold $100 million of common stock, what line item on the projected balance sheet on Part
                                      II of the template would you make this entry?
                                  13. Just to the right of each line item on PART II of the projected income statement and projected
                                      balance sheet, the template provides what type of hint?
                                  14. Why should a student enter into the template their existing and projected financial data, from
                                      oldest year to most recent year, even though the template will allow students to enter in dates
                                      in any sequence desired and even though many published statements may enter the data in re-
                                      verse order?

                                  As discussed in this chapter, EPS/EBIT analysis is the most widely used financial tool used to
                                  determine whether debt or equity is better to raise needed capital. However, all analytical tools
                                  have some limitations. Chapter 8 identifies and discusses seven limitations of EPS/EBIT analy-
                                  sis, as follows:
                                   1.   Flexibility
                                   2.   Control
                                   3.   Timing
                                   4.   Extent leveraged
                                   5.   Continuity
                                   6.   EBIT ranges
                                   7.   Dividends
                                      The purpose of this exercise is to examine more closely the limitations of EPS/EBIT analysis in
                                  terms of their relative severity. In addition, the purpose is to examine whether individual decision

               making is better than group decision making. Academic research suggests that groups make better
               decisions than individuals about 80 percent of the time.
               Instructions
               Rank the seven limitations of EPS/EBIT analysis as to their severity, where 1 = most severe to 7 =
               least severe. Use Table 8-16. First, rank the limitations as an individual. Then, rank the limitations as
               part of a group of three. Thus, determine what person(s) and what group(s) here today can come clos-
               est to the expert ranking. This exercise enables examination of the relative effectiveness of individual
               versus group decision making in strategic planning.
               Steps
                   1. Fill in Column 1 in Table 8-16 to reveal your individual ranking of the severity of the seven limita-
                      tions (1 = most severe to 7 = least severe). For example, if you think Limitation #1 (Flexibility) is
                      the fourth-most severe limitation, then enter a 4 in Table 8-15 in Column 1 beside Flexibility.
                   2. Fill in Column 2 in Table 8-16 to reveal your group’s ranking of the severity of the seven limita-
                      tions (1 = most severe to 7 = least severe).
                   3. Fill in Column 3 in Table 8-16 to reveal the expert’s ranking of the seven limitations.
                   4. Fill in Column 4 in Table 8-16 to reveal the absolute difference between Column 1 and Column
                      3 to reveal how well you performed as an individual in this exercise. (Note: Absolute difference
                      disregards negative numbers.)
                   5. Fill in Column 5 in Table 8-16 to reveal the absolute difference between Column 2 and Column
                      3 to reveal how well your group performed in this exercise.
                   6. Sum Column 4. Sum Column 5.
                   7. Compare the Column 4 sum with the Column 5 sum. If your Column 4 sum is less than your
                      Column 5 sum, then you performed better as an individual than as a group. Normally, group
                      decision making is superior to individual decision making, so if you did better than your group,
                      you did excellent.
                   8. The Individual Winner(s): The individual(s) with the lowest Column 4 sum is the WINNER.
                   9. The Group Winners(s): The group(s) with the lowest Column 5 score is the WINNER.

                                      MINI-CASE ON HASBRO, INC.

                                      NERF WANTS TO TAKE OVER BARBIE DOLL:
                                      THE CASE OF HASBRO, INC.
                                      Based in Pawtucket, Rhode Island, the largest U.S. toymaker, Hasbro Inc., is engaged in a hostile
                                      takeover attempt of the second largest toymaker, Mattel Inc., based in El Segundo, California. Mattel
                                      is the maker of Barbie dolls, American Girl dolls, and Fisher-Price and Hot Wheels toys. But Mattel
                                      has been losing money and its market value has dropped to less than $5 billion, whereas Hasbro is
                                      valued at about $11 billion. Hasbro has brands such as Nerf, Transformers, and My Little Pony.
    Let’s Build a House                    Hasbro’s stock has gained 18 percent on the year to $92, whereas Mattel’s stock has declined 47
                                      percent on the year to $14. Hasbro owns no toy factories, but Mattel does own its factories. Hasbro
                                      has forged close ties to Hollywood by producing movies and creating toys tied to movies, even hav-
                                      ing toys now tied to Disney’s Star Wars and Princess characters. A problem for toy makers is that
                                      Toys “R” Us has closed all stores and Lego AS just cut 8 percent of its global staff. A few years ago
                                      Mattel was trying to buy Hasbro but the firm’s fortunes have changed place.
                                           Even if Hasbro and Mattel merge, the combined company would control about 35 percent of the
                                      U.S. market and 22 percent of global toy sales. In some categories however, such as model vehicles,
                                      which includes Mattel’s Hot Wheels, the combined firm would control 62 percent of the U.S. market.
                                      Mattel recently suspended its dividend payments to shareholders to stay financially solvent; credit
                                      rating firms are downgrading Mattel even as the firm tries to secure more debt financing.

                                      Questions
                                       1.   How much is Hasbro worth today compared to the $11 billion figure in late 2017?
                                       2.   How much is Mattel worth today compared to the $5 billion figure in late 2017?
                                       3.   What would be the advantages and disadvantages of these two firms combining?
                                       4.   Assess the extent that antitrust regulators would approve a combination of the industry’s two
                                            biggest players.

                                                   internal environments change. It is essential, therefore, that strategists systematically
                                                   evaluate the execution of strategies, as illustrated and highlighted in Figure 9-1. This
                                            chapter presents a framework that can guide managers’ efforts to evaluate strategies, to make
                                            sure they are working, and to make timely changes.
                                                 Boards of directors evaluate strategies as part of their job description, so governance issues
                                            are discussed in this chapter. Guidelines are presented in this chapter for actually doing strategic
                                            planning because board members are more and more involved in the process with top manage-
                                            ment. Special challenges impacting strategic-planning activities also are discussed.
                                                 The exemplary strategist showcased in this chapter is Anthony Wood, founder and CEO of
                                            Roku, the fast-growing video streaming and television manufacturing and marketing company.


                                  LO 9.1    The Strategy-Evaluation Process
                                            The strategic-management process results in decisions that can have significant, long-lasting conse-
                                            quences. Erroneous strategic decisions can inflict severe penalties and can be exceedingly difficult, if
                                            not impossible, to reverse. Therefore, most strategists agree that strategy evaluation is vital to an or-
                                            ganization’s well-being; timely evaluations can alert management to problems or potential problems
                                            before a situation becomes critical. The strategy-evaluation process includes three basic activities:
                                              1. Examine the underlying bases of a firm’s strategy.
                                              2. Compare expected results with actual results.
                                              3. Take corrective actions to ensure that performance conforms to plans.
                                                Adequate and timely feedback is the cornerstone of effective strategy evaluation. Strategy
                                            evaluation can be no better than the information on which it is based. Too much pressure
                                            from top managers may result in lower-level managers contriving numbers they think will be

     that provides media players, televisions, and accessories. Headquartered
     in Los Gatos, California, Roku manufactures and sells televisions with its
     own special operating system. About 20 percent of all televisions sold in
     the United States are powered by the Roku operating system, but Roku’s
     market share is growing nearly 30+ percent annually. Unlike many of its
     biggest rivals, Roku relies solely on deals with outside content produc-
     ers; Roku does not make its own original programming, in contrast with
                                                                                  recording and editing. Wood completed his bachelor’s degree in elec-

               satisfactory. Strategy evaluation can be a complex and sensitive undertaking. Too much em-
               phasis on evaluating strategies may be expensive and counterproductive. No one likes to be
               evaluated too closely! Yet too little or no evaluation can create even worse problems. Strategy
               evaluation is essential to ensure that stated objectives are being achieved. Strategists need to cre-
               ate an organizational culture where strategy evaluation is viewed as an opportunity to make the
               firm better, so the firm can compete better, and so everyone in the firm can share in the firm’s
               increased profitability. This chapter reveals how to evaluate strategies.
                    In many organizations, strategy evaluation is simply an appraisal of how well an organiza-
               tion has performed. Have the firm’s assets increased? Has there been an increase in profitabil-
               ity? Have sales increased? Have productivity levels increased? Have profit margin, return on
               investment, and earnings-per-share ratios increased? Some firms argue that their strategy must
               have been correct if the answers to these types of questions are affirmative. Well, the strategy or
               strategies may have been correct, but this type of reasoning can be misleading because strategy
               evaluation must have both a long-run and short-run focus. Bad strategies may not affect short-
               term operating results until it is too late to make needed changes, and excellent strategies may
               take several years instead of months to produce great results.
                    Strategy evaluation is important because firms face dynamic environments in which key
               external and internal factors often change quickly and dramatically. Success today is no guaran-
               tee of success tomorrow! Joseph Stalin was a ruthless leader (from 1928 on) and premier (from
               1941 on) of the Soviet Union until his death in 1953. A famous quote from Stalin was: “History
               shows that there are no invincible armies.” This quote reveals that even the mightiest, most suc-
               cessful firms must continually evaluate their strategies and be wary of rival organizations. A firm
               should never be lulled into complacency with success. Countless firms have thrived 1 year only
               to struggle for survival the following year. According to Peter Drucker, “Unless strategy evalu-
               ation is performed seriously and systematically, and unless strategists are willing to act on the
               results, energy will be used up defending yesterday.”
                    It is impossible to demonstrate conclusively that a particular strategy is optimal or even to
               guarantee that it will work. But any strategy must provide for the creation or maintenance of a
               competitive advantage in a selected area of activity. Competitive advantages normally are the re-
               sult of superiority in one of three areas: (1) resources, (2) skills, or (3) position. The idea that the
               positioning of one’s resources can enhance their combined effectiveness is familiar to military
               theorists, chess players, and diplomats. Position can also play a crucial role in an organization’s
               strategy. Once gained, a good position is defensible—meaning that it is so costly to capture
               that rivals are deterred from full-scale attacks. Positional advantage tends to be self-sustaining
               so long as the key external and internal factors that underlie it remain stable. This is why en-
               trenched firms can be difficult to unseat, even if their raw skill levels are only average.1
                    Strategy evaluation is becoming increasingly difficult because domestic and world economies
               are today more interrelated, product life cycles are shorter, technological advancements are faster,
               change occurs rapidly, competitors abound globally, planning cycles are shorter, and social media
               and smartphones have changed everything. A fundamental problem facing managers today is how
               to effectively manage a workforce that increasingly demands fairness, openness, transparency,
               flexibility, and involvement. Managers need empowered employees acting responsibly. Otherwise
               the costs to companies in terms of damaged reputations, fines, missed opportunities, and diversion
               of management’s attention can be enormous; bad news can spread like wildfire over social media.
               Too much pressure to achieve specific goals can lead to dysfunctional behavior, as Wells Fargo
               found out a few years ago putting so much pressure on their bankers opening new accounts.
                    Evaluating strategies on a continuous rather than on a periodic basis allows benchmarks of
               progress to be established and more effectively monitored. Some strategies take years to imple-
               ment; consequently, associated results may not become apparent for years. Successful strategies
               combine patience with a willingness to promptly take corrective actions when necessary. There
               always comes a time when corrective actions are needed in an organization! Monitoring and
               managing change is vital. Centuries ago, a writer (perhaps Solomon) made the following obser-
               vations about change:
                    There is a time for everything,
                    A time to be born and a time to die,
                    A time to plant and a time to uproot,

                                                 Managers and employees of a firm should be kept up to date regarding progress being
                                            made toward achieving a firm’s objectives. If assumptions, expectations, or results deviate
                                            significantly from forecasts, then strategy evaluation is needed. Evaluating strategies is like
                                            formulating and implementing strategies in the sense that people make the difference. Through
                                            involvement in the process of evaluating strategies, managers and employees become committed
                                            to keeping the firm moving steadily toward achieving objectives.
                                                 As indicated in the Global Capsule 9, even countries engage in the three strategy-evaluation

               Reviewing Bases of Strategy
               Relationships among strategy-evaluation activities are illustrated in Figure 9-2. As shown,
               reviewing the underlying bases of an organization’s strategy could be approached by devel-
               oping a revised EFE Matrix and IFE Matrix. A revised IFE Matrix should focus on changes in
               the organization’s management, marketing, finance, accounting, production, and information
               systems (MIS) strengths and weaknesses. A revised EFE Matrix should indicate how effective
               a firm’s strategies have been in response to key opportunities and threats. This analysis could
               also address such questions as the following:
                   1.   How have competitors reacted to our strategies?
                   2.   How have competitors’ strategies changed?
                   3.   Have major competitors’ strengths and weaknesses changed?
                   4.   Why are competitors making certain strategic changes?
                   5.   Why are some competitors’ strategies more successful than others?
                   6.   How satisfied are our competitors with their present market positions and profitability?
                   7.   How far can our major competitors be pushed before retaliating?
                   8.   How could we more effectively cooperate with our competitors?
                    Numerous external and internal factors can prevent firms from achieving long-term and an-
               nual objectives. Externally, actions by competitors, changes in demand, changes in technology,
               economic changes, demographic shifts, and governmental actions may prevent objectives from
               being accomplished. Internally, ineffective strategies may have been chosen or implementation
               activities may have been poor. Objectives may have been too optimistic. Thus, failure to achieve
               objectives may not be the result of unsatisfactory work by managers and employees. All organi-
               zational members need to know this to encourage their support for strategy-evaluation activities.
               Organizations desperately need to know as soon as possible when their strategies are not effec-
               tive. Sometimes managers and employees on the front lines discover this well before strategists.
               It is not a question of whether underlying key external and internal factors will change, but
               rather when they will change and in what ways. Here are some key questions to address in evalu-
               ating strategies:
                   1.   Are our internal strengths still strengths?
                   2.   Have we added other internal strengths? If so, what are they?
                   3.   Are our internal weaknesses still weaknesses?
                   4.   Do we now have other internal weaknesses? If so, what are they?
                   5.   Are our external opportunities still opportunities?
                   6.   Are there now other external opportunities? If so, what are they?
                   7.   Are our external threats still threats?
                   8.   Are there now other external threats? If so, what are they?
                   9.   Are we vulnerable to a hostile takeover?

                                         Measuring Organizational Performance
                                         Another important strategy-evaluation activity is measuring organizational performance.
                                         This activity includes comparing expected results to actual results, investigating deviations from
                                         plans, evaluating individual performance, and examining progress being made toward meeting
                                         stated objectives. Both long-term and annual objectives are commonly used in this process.
                                         Criteria for evaluating strategies should be measurable and easily verifiable. Criteria that predict
                                         results may be more important than those that reveal what already has happened. For example,

               rather than simply being informed that sales in the last quarter were 20 percent under what was
               expected, strategists need to know that sales in the next quarter may be 20 percent below stan-
               dard unless some action is taken to counter the trend. Really effective control requires accurate
               forecasting.
                    Failure to make satisfactory progress toward accomplishing long-term or annual objectives
               signals a need for corrective actions. Many factors, such as unreasonable policies, unexpected
               turns in the economy, unreliable suppliers or distributors, or ineffective strategies, can result in
               unsatisfactory progress toward meeting objectives. Problems can result from ineffectiveness (not
               doing the right things) or inefficiency (poorly doing the right things).
                    Determining which objectives are most important in the evaluation of strategies can be dif-
               ficult. Strategy evaluation is based on both quantitative and qualitative criteria. Selecting the
               exact set of criteria for evaluating strategies depends on a particular organization’s size, industry,
               strategies, and management philosophy. An organization pursuing a retrenchment strategy, for
               example, could have a different set of evaluative criteria from an organization pursuing a market-
               development strategy. Quantitative criteria commonly used to evaluate strategies are financial
               ratios, often monitored for each segment of the firm. Strategists use financial ratios to make
               three critical comparisons:
                   1. Compare the firm’s performance over different time periods.
                   2. Compare the firm’s performance to competitors.
                   3. Compare the firm’s performance to industry averages.
                    Many variables can and should be included in measuring organizational performance.
               As indicated in Table 9-2, typically a favorable or unfavorable variance is recorded monthly,
               quarterly, and annually, and resultant actions needed are then determined.
                    Potential problems are associated with using only quantitative criteria for evaluating
               strategies. First, most quantitative criteria are geared to annual objectives rather than long-term
               objectives. Also, different accounting methods can provide different results on many quantitative
               criteria. Third, intuitive judgments are almost always involved in deriving quantitative criteria.
               Thus, qualitative criteria are also important in evaluating strategies. Human factors such as high
               absenteeism and turnover rates, poor production quality and quantity rates, or low employee
               satisfaction can be underlying causes of declining performance. Marketing, finance, accounting,
               or MIS factors can also cause financial problems. The need for a “balanced” quantitative/
               qualitative approach in evaluating strategies gives rise in a moment to discussion of the balanced
               scorecard.

                                      Several additional key questions that reveal the need for qualitative judgments in strategy
                                  evaluation are as follows:
                                   1. How good is the firm’s balance of investments between high-risk and low-risk projects?
                                   2. How good is the firm’s balance of investments between long-term and short-term projects?
                                   3. How good is the firm’s balance of investments between slow-growing markets and
                                      fast-growing markets?
                                   4. How good is the firm’s balance of investments among different divisions?
                                   5. To what extent are the firm’s alternative strategies socially responsible?
                                   6. What are the relationships among the firm’s key internal and external strategic factors?
                                   7. How are major competitors likely to respond to particular strategies?


                                  Taking Corrective Actions
                                  The final strategy-evaluation activity, taking corrective actions, requires making changes to
                                  competitively reposition a firm for the future. As indicated in Table 9-3, examples of changes
                                  that may be needed are altering an organization’s structure, replacing one or more key individu-
                                  als, selling a division, or revising a business mission. Other changes could include establishing
                                  or revising objectives, devising new policies, issuing stock to raise capital, adding additional
                                  salespersons, allocating resources differently, or developing new performance incentives. Taking
                                  corrective actions does not necessarily mean that existing strategies will be abandoned or even
                                  that new strategies must be formulated.
                                       If either the actions or results of employees, departments, or divisions do not comply with
                                  preconceived or planned achievements, then corrective actions are needed. For example, the
                                  U.S. iconic company General Electric (GE) is taking massive corrective actions (all 12 items
                                  listed in Table 9-3) in 2018 to reverse severe declines in both revenues and profits over the last
                                  few years. GE is cutting $1 billion annually in expenses through the end of 2018.
                                       No organization can survive as an island; no organization can escape change. Taking cor-
                                  rective actions is necessary to keep an organization on track toward achieving stated objectives.
                                  In his thought-provoking books Future Shock and The Third Wave, Alvin Toffler argued that
                                  business environments are becoming so dynamic and complex that they threaten people and
                                  organizations with future shock, which occurs when the nature, types, and speed of changes
                                  overpower an individual’s or organization’s ability and capacity to adapt. Strategy evaluation
                                  enhances an organization’s ability to adapt successfully to changing circumstances.
                                       Taking corrective actions raises employees’ and managers’ anxieties. Research suggests
                                  that participation in strategy-evaluation activities is one of the best ways to overcome individu-
                                  als’ resistance to change. According to Erez and Kanfer, individuals accept change best when
                                  they have a cognitive understanding of the changes, a sense of control over the situation, and
                                  an awareness that necessary actions are going to be taken to implement the changes.3 The most

               successful organizations today continuously adapt to changes in the competitive environment.
               It is not sufficient today to simply react to change. Managers must anticipate change and be the
               creator of change.
                     Strategy evaluation can lead to strategy-formulation or strategy-implementation changes, or
               no changes at all. Strategists cannot escape having to revise strategies and implementation ap-
               proaches sooner or later. Hussey and Langham offered the following insight on taking corrective
               actions:

                   Resistance to change is often emotionally based and not easily overcome by rational ar-
                   gument. Resistance may be based on such feelings as loss of status, implied criticism of
                   present competence, fear of failure in the new situation, annoyance at not being consulted,
                   lack of understanding of the need for change, or insecurity in changing from well-known
                   and fixed methods. It is necessary, therefore, to overcome such resistance by creating situ-
                   ations of participation and full explanation when changes are envisaged.4

                    Corrective actions should place an organization in a better position to capitalize on internal
               strengths; to take advantage of key external opportunities; to avoid, reduce, or mitigate exter-
               nal threats; and to improve internal weaknesses. Corrective actions should have a proper time
               horizon and an appropriate amount of risk. They should be internally consistent and socially
               responsible. Perhaps most important, corrective actions strengthen an organization’s competitive
               position in its basic industry. Continuous strategy evaluation keeps strategists close to the pulse
               of an organization and provides information needed for an effective strategic-management sys-
               tem. Carter Bayles described the benefits of strategy evaluation as follows:

                   Evaluation activities may renew confidence in the current business strategy or point to
                   the need for actions to correct some weaknesses, such as erosion of product superiority
                   or technological edge. In many cases, the benefits of strategy evaluation are much more
                   far-reaching, for the outcome of the process may be a fundamentally new strategy that
                   will lead, even in a business that is already turning a respectable profit, to substantially
                   increased earnings. It is this possibility that justifies strategy evaluation, for the payoff can
                   be very large.5


               The Balanced Scorecard                                                                                  LO 9.3
               Do a Google search using the keywords balanced scorecard images and you will see more than
               a hundred currently used balanced scorecards. Note the wide variation in format evidenced
               through the images. Developed in the early 1990s by Harvard Business School professors Robert
               Kaplan and David Norton, and refined continually through today, the balanced scorecard is a
               strategy evaluation and control technique. The technique is based on the need of firms to “bal-
               ance” financial measures that are often used exclusively in strategy evaluation with nonfinancial
               measures such as product quality, business ethics, environmental sustainability, employee mo-
               rale, pollution abatement, community involvement, and customer service. The rationale behind
               balanced scorecard is that financial measures report what has already happened, whereas non-
               financial metrics have a tendency to better predict what will happen in the future. An effective
               balanced scorecard contains a carefully chosen combination of strategic and financial objectives
               tailored to the company’s business.
                    As a tool to manage and evaluate strategy, the balanced scorecard is currently in use at
               United Parcel Service, 3M Corporation, Heinz, and hundreds of other firms. For example,
               3M Corporation has a financial objective to achieve annual growth in earnings per share of 10
               percent or better, as well as a strategic objective to have at least 30 percent of sales come from
               products introduced in the past 4 years. The overall aim of a balanced scorecard is to “balance”
               shareholder objectives with customer and operational objectives. These sets of objectives inter-
               relate and many even conflict. For example, customers want low price and high service, which
               may conflict with shareholders’ desire for a high return on their investment.
                    A sample balanced scorecard is provided in Table 9-4. Notice that the firm examines six
               key issues in evaluating its strategies: (1) Customers, (2) Managers/Employees, (3) Operations/
               Processes, (4) Community/Social Responsibility, (5) Business Ethics/Natural Environment, and

                                           (6) Financial. The balanced scorecard approach to strategy evaluation aims to balance long-
                                           term with short-term concerns, to balance financial with nonfinancial concerns, and to balance
                                           internal with external concerns. The balanced scorecard could be constructed differently—that
                                           is, adapted to particular firms in various industries with the underlying theme or thrust being the
                                           same, which is to evaluate the firm’s strategies based on both key quantitative and qualitative
                                           measures. Companies strive to achieve both quantitative and qualitative objectives all along their
                                           value chain, from end-users to raw materials, as discussed in Chapter 5.


                                  LO 9.4   Boards of Directors: Governance Issues
                                           A board of directors is a group of individuals at the top of an organization with oversight and
                                           guidance over management and who look out for shareholders’ interests. The act of oversight
                                           and direction is referred to as governance. The National Association of Corporate Directors de-
                                           fines governance as “the characteristic of ensuring that long-term strategic objectives and plans
                                           are established and that the proper management structure is in place to achieve those objectives,
                                           while at the same time making sure that the structure functions to maintain the corporation’s
                                           integrity, reputation, and responsibility to its various constituencies.” Boards are held account-
                                           able for the entire performance of an organization. Boards of directors are increasingly sued by
                                           shareholders for mismanaging their interests. New accounting rules in the United States and

               Europe now enhance corporate-governance codes and require much more extensive financial
               disclosure among publicly held firms. The roles and duties of a board of directors can be divided
               into four broad categories, as indicated in Table 9-5.
                    Shareholders are increasingly wary of boards of directors. Most directors globally have
               ended their image as rubber-stamping friends of CEOs. Boards are more autonomous than ever
               and continually mindful of and responsive to legal and institutional-investor scrutiny. Boards
               are more cognizant of auditing and compliance issues and more reluctant to approve excessive
               compensation and perks. Boards stay much more abreast today of public scandals that attract
               shareholder and media attention. Increasingly, boards of directors monitor and review executive
               performance carefully without favoritism to executives, representing shareholders rather than
               the CEO. Boards are more proactive today, whereas in years past they were often merely reac-
               tive. These are all reasons why the chair of the board of directors should not also serve as the
               firm’s CEO. In North America, the number of new incoming CEOs that also serve as Chair of
               the Board has declined to about 10 percent today from about 50 percent 15 years ago.
                    Until recently, individuals serving on boards of directors did most of their work sitting around
               polished mahogany tables. However, Hewlett-Packard’s directors, among many others, now log
               on to their own special board website twice a week and conduct business based on extensive con-
               fidential briefing information posted there by the firm’s top management team. Then the board
               members meet face to face fully informed every 2 months to discuss the biggest issues facing the
               firm. New board involvement policies are aimed at curtailing lawsuits against board members.

    310    PART 4 • STRATEGY EVALUATION AND GOVERNANCE

                                                Research reveals that companies with fewer board members outperform larger boards,
                                           largely because having fewer directors facilitates deeper debates, more nimble decision making,
                                           and greater accountability.6 Also, among companies with a market capitalization of at least $10
                                           billion, smaller boards produced substantially higher shareholder returns. Specifically, 9-person
                                           boards perform much better, for example, than 14- to 15-member boards. Thus, many companies
                                           are reducing their number of board members. As part of a major restructuring, GE recently re-
                                           duced the size of its board from 18 to 12. This change brings GE more in line with the national
                                           average of 10.9 board members per U.S. firm with a market capitalization of at least $10 billion.
                                                Another benefit of fewer board members is that CEOs are more often reprimanded (or dis-
                                           missed) if needed. Dr. David Yermack, a finance professor at New York University’s business
                                           school, reports that smaller boards are generally more decisive, more cohesive, more hands-on,
                                           and have more informal meetings and fewer committees. Netflix is another example of a com-
                                           pany with a small board, only 7 members, who debate extensively before approving important
                                           management moves. Netflix is doing great. In contrast, Eli Lilly & Co. has 14 board members
                                           who find it “too big to encourage the kinds of discussions you want, because drilling down on
                                           different issues simply takes too long; members feel constrained even asking a second or third
                                           question.” Bank of America has 15 directors—too many to be efficient. In addition, the chair
                                           of the board should rarely, if ever, be the same person as the CEO, as discussed. In summary,
                                           companies should seek to reduce their board of directors to fewer than 10 persons, whenever
                                           possible—and strategy students should examine this issue in their assigned case companies.
                                                Today, boards of directors are composed mostly of outsiders who are becoming more in-
                                           volved in organizations’ strategic management. The trend in the United States is toward much
                                           greater board member accountability with smaller boards, now averaging 11 members rather
                                           than 18 as they did a few years ago. An executive recruitment firm, Spencer Stuart, reported in
                                           late 2017 that women and minorities account for half of the 397 newest independent board of
                                           directors’ members at S&P 500 companies—the first time this has ever occurred; women made
                                           up 36 percent of new directors appointed. Spencer Stuart also reports that more than half of S&P
                                           companies now have split the roles of chairman and CEO.
                                                BusinessWeek provides the following “principles of good governance”:
                                            1. Never have more than two of the firm’s executives (current or past) on the board.
                                            2. Never allow a firm’s executives to serve on the board’s audit, compensation, or nominating
                                               committee.
                                            3. Require all board members to own a large amount of the firm’s equity.
                                            4. Require all board members to attend at least 75 percent of all meetings.
                                            5. Require the board to meet annually to evaluate its own performance, without the CEO,
                                               COO, or top management in attendance.
                                            6. Never allow the CEO to be chairperson of the board.
                                            7. Never allow interlocking directorships (where a director or CEO sits on another director’s
                                               board).7
                                                Jeff Sonnerfeld, associate dean of the Yale School of Management, comments, “Boards of
                                           directors are now rolling up their sleeves and becoming much more closely involved with man-
                                           agement decision making.” Company CEOs and boards are required to personally certify finan-
                                           cial statements; company loans to company executives and directors are illegal; and there is faster
                                           reporting of insider stock transactions. Just as directors place more emphasis on staying informed
                                           about an organization’s health and operations, they are also taking a more active role in ensuring
                                           that publicly issued documents are accurate representations of a firm’s status. Failure to accept
                                           responsibility for auditing or evaluating a firm’s strategy is considered a serious breach of a di-
                                           rector’s duties. Legal suits are becoming more common against directors for fraud, omissions,
                                           inaccurate disclosures, lack of due diligence, and culpable ignorance about a firm’s operations.

                                           Four particular challenges that face all strategists today are (1) deciding whether the process
                                           should be more an art or a science, (2) deciding whether strategies should be visible or hidden
                                           from stakeholders, (3) contingency planning, and (4) auditing.

               The Art or Science Issue
               This book is consistent with most of the strategy literature in advocating that strategic manage-
               ment be viewed more as a science than an art. This perspective contends that firms need to
               systematically assess their external and internal environments, conduct research, carefully evalu-
               ate the pros and cons of various alternatives, perform analyses, and then decide on a particular
               course of action. In contrast, Mintzberg’s notion of “crafting” strategies embodies the artistic
               model, which suggests that strategic decision making be based primarily on holistic thinking,
               intuition, creativity, and imagination.8 Mintzberg and his followers reject strategies that result
               from objective analysis, preferring instead subjective imagination. In contrast, “strategy sci-
               entists” reject strategies that emerge from emotion, hunch, creativity, and politics. Proponents
               of the artistic view often consider strategic planning exercises to be time poorly spent. The
               Mintzberg philosophy insists on informality, whereas strategy scientists (including this text’s au-
               thors) insist on more formality. Mintzberg refers to strategic planning as an “emergent” process,
               whereas strategy scientists use the term deliberate process.9
                    The answer to the art-versus-science question is one that strategists must decide for
               themselves, and certainly the two approaches are not mutually exclusive. The CEO of Williams-
               Sonoma, Laura Alber, recently stated, “I’ve found that the very best solutions arise from a
               willingness to blend art with science, ideas with data, and instinct with analysis.” In deciding
               which approach is more effective, however, consider that the business world today has become
               increasingly complex and more intensely competitive. There is less room for error in strategic
               planning. Recall that Chapter 1 discussed the importance of intuition, experience, and subjec-
               tivity in strategic planning, and even the weights and ratings discussed in Chapters 3, 4, and
               6 certainly require good judgment. But the idea of deciding on strategies for any firm without
               thorough research and analysis, at least in the mind of these authors, is unwise. Certainly, in
               smaller firms there can be more informality in the process compared to larger firms, but even for
               smaller firms, a wealth of competitive information is available on the Internet and elsewhere and
               should be collected, assimilated, and evaluated before deciding on a course of action on which
               survival of the firm may hinge. The livelihood of countless employees and shareholders may
               hinge on the effectiveness of strategies selected. Too much is at stake to be less than thorough in
               formulating strategies. It is not wise for a strategist to rely too heavily on gut feeling and opinion
               instead of research data, competitive intelligence, and analysis in formulating strategies.


               The Visible or Hidden Issue
               An interesting aspect of any competitive analysis discussion is whether strategies themselves
               should be secret or open within firms. The mini-case near the end of this chapter examines this
               issue for TJX Companies, a secretive company. The Chinese warrior Sun Tzu and military lead-
               ers today strive to keep strategies secret, because war is based on deception. But for business
               organizations, secrecy may not be best. Keeping strategies secret from employees and stakehold-
               ers at large could severely inhibit employee and stakeholder communication, understanding, and
               commitment, as well as forgo valuable input that these persons could have regarding formulation
               or implementation of those strategies. As indicated in the Ethics Capsule 9, CEO Bipul Sinha
               considers transparency to be the key to his company’s success.
                    Strategists must decide for themselves whether the risk of rival firms easily knowing and
               exploiting a firm’s strategies is worth the benefit of improved employee and stakeholder motiva-
               tion and input. Most executives agree that some strategic information should remain confidential
               to top managers and that steps should be taken to ensure that such information is not dissemi-
               nated beyond the inner circle. For a firm that you may own or manage, would you advocate more
               openness or secrecy in regard to strategies being formulated and implemented?
                    There are excellent reasons to keep the strategy process and strategies themselves visible
               and open rather than hidden and secret. There are also excellent reasons to keep strategies hid-
               den from all but top-level executives. Strategists must decide for themselves what is best for
               their firms. This text comes down largely on the side of being visible and open, but certainly this
               may not be best for all strategists and all firms. As pointed out in Chapter 1, Sun Tzu argued that
               all war is based on deception and that the best maneuvers are those not easily predicted by rivals.
               Business and war are analogous in many respects.

                                                Four reasons to be primarily open with the strategy process and resultant decisions are
                                            these:
                                             1. Managers, employees, and other stakeholders can readily contribute to the process. They
                                                often have excellent ideas. Secrecy would forgo many excellent ideas.
                                             2. Investors, creditors, and other stakeholders have greater basis for supporting a firm when
                                                they know what the firm is doing and where the firm is going.
                                             3. Visibility promotes democracy, whereas secrecy promotes autocracy. Domestic firms and
                                                most foreign firms prefer democracy over autocracy as a management style.
                                             4. Participation and openness enhance understanding, commitment, and communication
                                                within the firm.
                                                 Four reasons why some firms prefer to conduct strategic planning in secret and keep strate-
                                            gies hidden from all but the highest-level executives are as follows:
                                             1. Free dissemination of a firm’s strategies may easily translate into competitive intelligence
                                                for rival firms who could exploit the firm given that information.
                                             2. Secrecy limits criticism, second-guessing, and hindsight.
                                             3. Participants in a visible strategy process become more attractive to rival firms who may
                                                lure them away.
                                             4. Secrecy limits rival firms from imitating or duplicating the firm’s strategies and undermin-
                                                ing the firm.
                                                  The obvious benefits of the visible versus hidden extremes suggest that a working balance
                                            must be sought between the apparent contradictions. Parnell says that in a perfect world all key
                                            individuals both inside and outside the firm should be involved in strategic planning, but in prac-
                                            tice, particularly sensitive and confidential information should always remain strictly confiden-
                                            tial to top managers.10 This balancing act is difficult but essential for survival of the firm.

                                            Employees at more and more companies are voting on more and more issues. For example,
                                            employees at InContext Solutions recently voted on whether to play music in office common
                                            areas. Employees at Whole Foods Market and at MediaMath Inc. vote quite often on issues.

               Research suggests that giving employees a voice or vote on even small issues such as holiday
               parties helps to spark loyalty to the company. InContext employees recently voted on whether to
               have cubicles or open tables and even on which brews to keep in the company keg. MediaMath
               employees recently voted on which new headquarters location they prefer to relocate.
                    Whole Foods employees vote on whether to keep new employees beyond a trial period of up
               to 90 days. Menlo Innovations employees vote on job applicants after observing how candidates
               work during a trial period. 1Sale.com employees recently voted to do away with free lunches
               in favor of lower health-insurance premiums. Social Tables Inc. employees recently voted on
               the company’s core values, as well as the company’s conference-room themes and the company
               theme song played at corporate events. The strategic decision at hand for many companies
               increasingly is the extent to allow or encourage employee voting on numerous large and small
               issues that affect workplace productivity and morale.
                    A 2017 Wall Street Journal article titled “Pay is Less Secretive in Millennial Workforce”
               reveals that in this day and age of sharing social contacts, pictures, and videos, millennials are
               issuing in a new corporate culture of democracy and openness (rather than secrecy), even with
               compensation systems. Research reveals that roughly one-third of U.S. workers ages 18 to 36
               say they are comfortable discussing pay with their coworkers, unlike baby boomers, ages 53 to
               71, who are four times more likely to want to keep pay secret. More than half of all millennials
               talk about pay with their friends whether pay is secret or not.

               Contingency Planning
               A basic premise of excellent strategic management is that firms strive to be proactive, planning
               ways to deal with unfavorable and favorable events before they occur. Too many organizations
               prepare contingency plans just for unfavorable events; this is a mistake because both minimizing
               threats and capitalizing on opportunities can improve a firm’s competitive position.
                    Regardless of how carefully strategies are formulated, implemented, and evaluated,
               unforeseen events, such as strikes, boycotts, natural disasters, arrival of foreign competitors, and
               government actions, can make a strategy obsolete. To minimize the impact of potential threats,
               organizations should develop contingency plans as part of their strategy-evaluation process.
               Contingency plans can be defined as alternative plans that can be put into effect if certain key
               events do not occur as expected. Only high-priority areas require the insurance of contingency
               plans. Strategists cannot and should not try to cover all bases by planning for all possible contin-
               gencies. But in any case, contingency plans should be as simple as possible.
                    Some contingency plans commonly established by firms include the following:
                   1. If a major competitor withdraws from particular markets as intelligence reports indicate,
                      what actions should our firm take?
                   2. If our sales objectives are not reached, what actions should our firm take to avoid profit losses?
                   3. If demand for our new product exceeds plans, what actions should our firm take to meet the
                      higher demand?
                   4. If certain disasters occur—such as loss of computer capabilities; a hostile takeover attempt;
                      loss of patent protection; or destruction of manufacturing facilities because of earthquakes,
                      tornadoes, or hurricanes—what actions should our firm take?
                   5. If a new technological advancement makes our new product obsolete sooner than expected,
                      what actions should our firm take?
                    Too many organizations discard alternative strategies not selected for implementation
               although the work devoted to analyzing these options would render valuable information.
               Alternative strategies not selected for implementation can serve as contingency plans in case
               the strategy or strategies selected do not work. When strategy-evaluation activities reveal the
               need for a major change quickly, an appropriate contingency plan can be executed in a timely
               way. Contingency plans can promote a strategist’s ability to respond quickly to key changes in
               the internal and external bases of an organization’s current strategy. For example, if underly-
               ing assumptions about the economy turn out to be wrong and contingency plans are ready,
               then managers can make appropriate changes promptly. Sometimes, external or internal con-
               ditions present unexpected opportunities. When such opportunities occur, contingency plans
               could allow an organization to quickly capitalize on them. Linneman and Chandran report that

                                           contingency planning gives users, such as DuPont, Dow Chemical, Consolidated Foods, and
                                           Emerson Electric, three major benefits, as follows:
                                            1. It enables quick responses to change.
                                            2. It prevents panic in crisis situations.
                                            3. It makes managers more adaptable by encouraging them to appreciate just how variable the
                                               future can be.
                                                In addition, Linneman and Chandran suggest that effective contingency planning involves a
                                           five-step process, as follows:
                                            1.   Identify both good and bad events that could jeopardize strategies.
                                            2.   Determine when the good and bad events are likely to occur.
                                            3.   Determine the expected pros and cons of each contingency event.
                                            4.   Develop contingency plans for key contingency events.
                                            5.   Determine early warning trigger points for key contingency events.11


                                           Auditing
                                           A frequently used tool in strategy evaluation is the audit. Auditing is defined by the American
                                           Accounting Association (AAA) as “a systematic process of objectively obtaining and evaluating
                                           evidence regarding assertions about economic actions and events to ascertain the degree of cor-
                                           respondence between these assertions and established criteria, and communicating the results to
                                           interested users.”12
                                                 Auditors examine the financial statements of firms to determine whether they have been
                                           prepared according to generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and whether they
                                           fairly represent the activities of the firm. Independent auditors use a set of standards called gen-
                                           erally accepted auditing standards (GAAS). Public accounting firms often have a consulting
                                           arm that provides strategy-evaluation services.
                                                 The new era of international financial reporting standards (IFRS) is approaching in the
                                           United States, and businesses need to go ahead and get ready to use IFRS. Many U.S. companies
                                           now report their finances using both the old GAAP and the new IFRS. “If companies don’t prepare,
                                           if they don’t start three years in advance,” warns business professor Donna Street at the University
                                           of Dayton, “they’re going to be in big trouble.” The GAAP standards are comprised of 25,000
                                           pages, whereas the IFRS comprises only 5,000 pages, so in that sense IFRS is less cumbersome.
                                                 Most large accounting firms and multinational firms favor the switch to IFRS, saying it
                                           will simplify accounting, make it easier for investors to compare firms across countries, and
                                           make it easier to raise capital globally. But many smaller firms oppose the upcoming change,
                                           believing it will be too costly; some firms are uneasy about the idea of giving an international
                                           body the authority to write accounting rules for the United States. Some firms also would pay
                                           higher taxes because last in, first out (LIFO) inventory methods are not allowed under IFRS.
                                           The International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) has publicly expressed “regret” over the
                                           slowness in the United States of adopting IFRS.
                                                 The U.S. Chamber of Commerce supports a change, saying it will lead to much more cross-
                                           border commerce and will help the United States compete in the world economy. Already the
                                           European Union and 113 nations have adopted or soon plan to use international rules, including
                                           Australia, China, India, Mexico, and Canada. So, the United States is likely to adopt IFRS rules,
                                           but this switch could unleash a legal and regulatory nightmare. A few U.S. multinational firms
                                           already use IFRS for their foreign subsidiaries, such as United Technologies (UT), which derives
                                           more than 60 percent of its revenues from abroad and is already training its entire staff to use IFRS.

                                           Failing to follow certain guidelines in conducting strategic management can foster criticisms of
                                           the process and create problems for the organization. Issues such as “Is strategic management
                                           in our firm a people process or a paper process?” should be addressed. Some organizations
                                           spend an inordinate amount of time developing a strategic plan, but then fail to follow through
                                           with effective implementation. Change and results in a firm come through implementation,
                                           not through formulation, although effective formulation is critically important for successful

               implementation. Continual evaluation of strategies is also essential because the world changes
               so rapidly that existing strategies can need modifying often.
                    Strategic management must not become a self-perpetuating bureaucratic mechanism.
               Rather, it must be a self-reflective learning process that familiarizes managers and employees
               in the organization with key strategic issues and feasible alternatives for resolving those issues.
               Strategic management must not become ritualistic, stilted, orchestrated, or too formal, predict-
               able, and rigid. Words supported by numbers, rather than numbers supported by words, should
               represent the medium for explaining strategic issues and organizational responses. A key role of
               strategists is to facilitate continuous organizational learning and change.
                    R. T. Lenz offers six guidelines for effective strategic management:
                   1. Keep the process simple and easily understandable.
                   2. Eliminate vague planning jargon.
                   3. Keep the process nonroutine; vary assignments, team membership, meeting formats, set-
                      tings, and even the planning calendar.
                   4. Welcome bad news and encourage devil’s advocate thinking.
                   5. Do not allow technicians to monopolize the planning process.
                   6. To the extent possible, involve managers from all areas of the firm.13
                    An important guideline for effective strategic management is open-mindedness. A willingness
               and eagerness to consider new information, new viewpoints, new ideas, and new possibilities is
               essential; all organizational members must share a spirit of inquiry and learning. Strategists such
               as chief executive officers, presidents, owners of small businesses, and heads of government agen-
               cies must commit themselves to listen to and understand managers’ positions well enough to be
               able to restate those positions to the managers’ satisfaction. In addition, managers and employees
               throughout the firm should be able to describe the firm’s strategies to the satisfaction of the strate-
               gists. This degree of discipline will promote understanding and learning.
                    Strategy-evaluation activities must be economical; too much information can be just as
               bad as too little information, and too many controls can do more harm than good. Strategy-
               evaluation activities also should be meaningful; they should specifically relate to a firm’s objec-
               tives. They should provide managers with useful information about tasks over which they have
               control and influence. Strategy-evaluation activities should provide timely information; on occa-
               sion and in some areas, managers may need information on a daily or even continuous basis. For
               example, when a firm has diversified by acquiring another firm, evaluative information may be
               needed frequently. In contrast, in a research-and-development (R&D) department, daily or even
               weekly evaluative information could be unnecessary. Approximate information that is timely is
               generally more desirable as a basis for strategy evaluation than accurate information that does
               not depict the present. Frequent measurement and rapid reporting may frustrate control rather
               than give better control. The time dimension of control must coincide with the time span of the
               event being measured.
                    Strategy-evaluation processes should be designed to provide a true picture of what is
               happening. For example, in a severe economic downturn, productivity and profitability ratios
               may drop alarmingly, although employees and managers are actually working harder. Strategy
               evaluations should fairly portray this type of situation. Information derived from the strategy-
               evaluation process should facilitate action and should be directed to those individuals in the
               organization who need to take action based on it. Managers commonly ignore evaluative reports
               that are provided only for informational purposes; not all managers need to receive all reports.
               Controls need to be action-oriented rather than information-oriented. The strategy-evaluation
               process should not dominate decisions; it should foster mutual understanding, trust, and com-
               mon sense. No department should fail to cooperate with another in evaluating strategies.
               Strategy evaluations should be simple, not too cumbersome, and not too restrictive. Complex
               strategy-evaluation systems often confuse people and accomplish little. The test of an effective
               evaluation system is its usefulness, not its complexity.
                    Large organizations require a more elaborate and detailed strategy-evaluation system be-
               cause it is more difficult to coordinate efforts among different divisions and functional areas.
               Managers in small companies often communicate daily with each other and their employees and
               do not need extensive evaluative reporting systems. Familiarity with local environments usually
               makes gathering and evaluating information much easier for small organizations than for large
               businesses. But the key to an effective strategy-evaluation system may be the ability to convince

                                  ily a reflection of their performance.
                                       There is no one ideal strategy-evaluation system. The unique aspects of an organiza-
                                  tion, including its size, management style, purpose, problems, and strengths, can determine a
                                  strategy-evaluation and control system’s final design. Robert Waterman offered the following
                                  observation about successful organizations’ strategy-evaluation and control systems:

                                     Successful companies treat facts as friends and controls as liberating. Morgan Guaranty
                                     and Wells Fargo not only survive but thrive in the troubled waters of bank deregulation,
                                     because their strategy evaluation and control systems are sound, their risk is contained, and
                                     they know themselves and the competitive situation so well. Successful companies have
                                     a voracious hunger for facts. They see information where others see only data. Successful
                                     companies maintain tight, accurate financial controls. Their people don’t regard controls
                                     as an imposition of autocracy but as the benign checks and balances that allow them to be
                                     creative and free.14

                                       No organization has unlimited resources. No firm can take on an unlimited amount of debt
                                  or issue an unlimited amount of stock to raise capital. Therefore, no organization can pursue all
                                  the strategies that potentially could benefit the firm. Strategic decisions, then, always have to be
                                  made to eliminate some courses of action and to allocate organizational resources among oth-
                                  ers. Most organizations can afford to pursue only a few corporate-level strategies at any given
                                  time. It is a critical mistake for managers to pursue too many strategies at the same time, thereby
                                  spreading the firm’s resources so thin that all strategies are jeopardized.
                                       Strategic decisions require tradeoffs such as long-range versus short-range considerations or
                                  maximizing profits versus increasing shareholders’ wealth. There are ethics issues, too. Strategy
                                  tradeoffs require subjective judgments and preferences. In many cases, a lack of objectivity in
                                  formulating strategy results in a loss of competitive posture and profitability. Most organiza-
                                  tions today recognize that strategic-management concepts and techniques can enhance the
                                  effectiveness of decisions. Subjective factors such as attitudes toward risk, concern for social
                                  responsibility, and organizational culture will always affect strategy-formulation decisions, but
                                  organizations need to be as objective as possible in considering qualitative factors. Table 9-6
                                  summarizes important guidelines for the strategic-planning process to be effective.

                    IMPLICATIONS FOR STRATEGISTS
                   Figure 9-3 reveals on the far left that strategists must systematically,   adapt to changes that occur externally and internally, because even
                   continuously, and carefully evaluate and monitor results by product,       the best strategic plan needs periodic adjusting as rival firms adjust
                   region, territory, segment, store, department, and even by indi-           and launch new initiatives and products in new areas. As described
                   vidual, so that timely corrective actions can be taken to keep the         in this chapter, the balanced scorecard is widely used by strategists

                                      Chapter Summary
                                      Effective strategy evaluation allows an organization to capitalize on internal strengths as they de-
                                      velop, to exploit external opportunities as they emerge, to recognize and defend against threats,
                                      and to mitigate or improve weaknesses before they become detrimental.
                                           Strategists in successful organizations take the time to formulate, implement, and then eval-
                                      uate strategies deliberately and systematically. Good strategists move their organization forward
                                      with purpose and direction, continually evaluating and improving the firm’s external and internal
                                      strategic positions. Strategy evaluation allows an organization to shape its own future rather than
                                      allowing it to be constantly shaped by remote forces that have little or no vested interest in the
                                      well-being of the enterprise.
                                           Although not a guarantee for success, strategic management allows organizations to make
                                      effective long-term decisions, to execute those decisions efficiently, and to take corrective
                                      actions as needed to ensure success. Computer networks and the Internet help to coordinate
                                      strategic-management activities and to ensure that decisions are based on good information. A
                                      key to effective strategy evaluation and to successful strategic management is an integration of
                                      intuition and analysis.
                                           A potentially fatal problem is the tendency for analytical and intuitive issues to polarize.
                                      This polarization leads to strategy evaluation that is dominated by either analysis or intuition,
                                      or to strategy evaluation that is discontinuous, with a lack of coordination among analytical and
                                      intuitive issues. Strategists in successful organizations realize that strategic management is first
                                      and foremost a people process. It is an excellent vehicle for fostering organizational communica-
                                      tion. People are what make the difference in organizations.
                                           The real key to effective strategic management is to accept the premise that the planning
                                      process is more important than the written plan, that the manager is continuously planning and
                                      does not stop planning when the written plan is finished. The written plan is only a snapshot as
                                      of the moment it is approved. If the manager is not planning on a continuous basis—planning,
                                      measuring, and revising—the written plan can become obsolete the day it is finished.

               Strategic Management?
               Purpose
               This chapter discusses numerous guidelines that should be followed in formulating, implement-
               ing, and evaluating strategies. Ten guidelines associated with the strategic-planning process are as
               follows:
                   1.   It should be a people process more than a paper process.
                   2.   It should be a learning process for all managers and employees.
                   3.   It should be words supported by numbers rather than numbers supported by words.
                   4.   It should vary assignments, team memberships, meeting formats, and even the planning
                        calendar.
                   5.   It should challenge the assumptions underlying the current corporate strategy and welcome bad
                        news.
                   6.   It should welcome open-mindedness and a spirit of inquiry and learning.
                   7.   It should not become ritualistic, stilted, orchestrated, or rigid.
                   8.   It should not be a formal system for control.

                                   9. It should not be controlled by “technicians.”
                                  10. Do not pursue too many strategies at once.
                                      The purpose of this exercise is to examine more closely guidelines for the strategic-planning pro-
                                  cess to be most effective. In addition, the purpose of this exercise is to examine whether individual
                                  decision making is better than group decision making. Academic research suggests that groups make
                                  better decisions than individuals about 80 percent of the time.
                                  Instructions
                                  Rank the 10 guidelines as to their relative importance for the strategic-planning process to be effec-
                                  tive, where 1 = most important to 10 = least important. First, rank the guidelines as an individual.
                                  Then, rank the guidelines as part a group of three. Thus, determine what person(s) and what group(s)
                                  here today can come closest to the expert ranking. This exercise enables examination of the relative
                                  effectiveness of individual versus group decision making in strategic planning.
                                  Steps
                                   1. Fill in Column 1 in Table 9-8 to reveal your individual ranking of the relative importance of the
                                      10 guidelines (1 = most important, 2 = next most important, to 10 = least important). For ex-
                                      ample, if you think Guideline #1 (People Process) is the eighth-most important guideline, then
                                      enter an 8 in Table 9-8 in Column 1 beside Guideline 1.
                                   2. Fill in Column 2 in Table 9-8 to reveal your group’s ranking of the relative importance of the
                                      10 guidelines (1 = most important, 2 = next most important, to 10 = least important).
                                   3. Fill in Column 3 in Table 9-8 to reveal the expert’s ranking of the 10 guidelines.
                                   4. Fill in Column 4 in Table 9-8 to reveal the absolute difference between Column 1 and Column
                                      3 to reveal how well you performed as an individual in this exercise. (Note: Absolute difference
                                      disregards negative numbers.)
                                   5. Fill in Column 5 in Table 9-8 to reveal the absolute difference between Column 2 and Column 3
                                      to reveal how well your group performed in this exercise.
                                   6. Sum Column 4. Sum Column 5.
                                   7. Compare the Column 4 sum with the Column 5 sum. If your Column 4 sum is less than your
                                      Column 5 sum, then you performed better as an individual than as a group. Normally, group
                                      decision making is superior to individual decision making, so if you did better than your group,
                                      you did excellent.
                                   8. The Individual Winner(s): The individual(s) with the lowest Column 4 sum is the WINNER.
                                   9. The Group Winners(s): The group(s) with the lowest Column 5 score is the WINNER.

               GREAT FOR TJX
               Headquartered in Framingham, Massachusetts, TJX Companies is a discount apparel and home
               fashions retailer in the United States and abroad. The company owns T.J. Maxx, Marmaxx,
               Home Goods, TJX Canada, TJX Europe, and Sierra Trading Post—operating in total more than
               4,000 stores in 9 countries: United States, Canada, United Kingdom, Ireland, Germany, Poland,
               Austria, the Netherlands, and Australia. TJX’s annual sales and profits are increasing nicely. I Save Money by Shopping TJ Maxx
               Operations today include 1,219 TJ Maxx, 1,057 Marshalls, 660 HomeGoods, 26 Sierra Trading
               Post, and 3 HomeSense stores, as well as tjmaxx.com and sierratradingpost.com in the United States;
               265 Winners, 117 HomeSense, and 72 Marshalls stores in Canada; 540 TJ Maxx and 55 HomeSense
               stores, as well as tjmaxx.com, in Europe; and 38 TJ Maxx stores in Australia.
                   In January 2018, TJX received an unsolicited offer from TRC Capital Corp. to purchase up to
               2,000,000 shares of TJX’s common stock at a price of $70.95 per share in cash. The offering price is
               4.34 percent below the $74.17 per share closing price of TJX’s common stock on December 15, 2017.
               TJX’s top management asked all TJX shareholders to reject the offer.
                   Regarding its corporate strategic planning and evaluating process, TJX is one of the most secre-
               tive of all publicly held retailers. As discussed in this chapter, there are numerous advantages and
               disadvantages of being secretive rather than open in revealing corporate strategy. TJX’s CEO, Carol
               Meyrowitz, as well as her top executives, rarely give interviews and never discuss corporate strategy.
               TJX does not talk about its corporate strategy in part because rival firms are eager to learn this in-
               formation to duplicate, imitate, undermine, and replicate. However, Fortune reports that “excellent
               inventory control” is a secret to the strategic success of TJX, including the following practices:
                1. Turn inventory over quickly. According to Morningstar, TJX turns over inventory every 55 days,
                   versus 85 days for its peer group. TJX is structured to buy quickly and sell merchandise. Often,
                   merchandise is sold before TJX has paid its vendors. Quick inventory turnover keeps new mer-
                   chandise on the floor so customers rarely see the same items on repeat visits. TJX trains employ-
                   ees to “buy when you see it; otherwise it will be gone.”
                2. Provide “value, trendy merchandise,” not “cheap, leftover merchandise.”
                3. Promote the “treasure hunt” experience rather than catering to lower-income customers. Even
                   high-income customers love the treasure hunt experience in TJX stores.
                4. Train buyers extensively and then give buyers autonomy to negotiate millions of dollars of pur-
                   chases from suppliers. Purchase inventory year-round, continuously rather than seasonally, and
                   purchase as close to the time of need as possible to negotiate a better price and be assured of the
                   latest fashion trend. Negotiate low prices for purchases even if it means often purchasing “all
                   available items in a category.”

               Questions
                1. What are the advantages and disadvantages of keeping the strategic-planning process secret ver-
                   sus placing the firm’s strategic plan on the corporate website and discussing strategies and plan-
                   ning publicly?
                2. What are three types of industries where secrecy is warranted and three industries where secrecy
                   is not warranted, or does type of industry even matter?
                3. Many colleges and universities have their strategic plan posted on their website. What are the
                   advantages and disadvantages of this practice?
                4. Rank order the four “secret” practices listed in terms of how important you think the items are to
                   TJX’s overall success. Rank the four items from 1 = most important to 4 = least important.

                                                     explain organizational performance. Increasingly, companies are following a triple-

                                             refers to actions an organization takes beyond what is legally required to protect or enhance
                                             the well-being of all living things, including employees. Socially responsible actions would
                                             include providing daycare for employees’ children or paying for college tuition for employees.
                                             Sustainability refers to the extent that an organization’s operations and actions protect, mend,
                                             and preserve rather than harm or destroy the environment. Switching your firm’s primary energy
                                             source to solar power is an example.

               Why “Good Ethics Is Good Business”                                                                      LO 10.1
               A rising tide of consciousness regarding the importance of business ethics is sweeping the
               United States and the rest of the world. Moral breaches of ethical conduct by both public and
               private organizations are reported hourly on Internet websites, newspapers, magazines, social
               media, news media, emails, and texts—quickly spreading fact and rumor pertaining to the inside
               dealings of firms. For example, in late 2017, the rate of self-reported foodborne illnesses was
               reported to be at least nine times higher for Chipotle than all other restaurant chains, according
               to Patrick Quade, the founder of IWasPoisoned.com.
                    Increasingly, executives’ and managers’ personal and professional decisions are placing
               them in the crosshairs of angry shareholders, disgruntled employees, and even their own board
               of directors—making the once imperious CEO far more vulnerable to personal, public, and
               corporate missteps. One reason CEO salaries are high is that they must take the moral risks of
               the firm. Strategists are responsible for developing, communicating, and enforcing a code of
               business ethics for their organizations. An integral part of the responsibility of all managers is to
               provide ethical leadership by constant example and demonstration. Managers hold positions that
               enable them to influence and educate many people; managers are responsible for developing
               and implementing ethical decision making. Gellerman offers some good advice for managers:

                   All managers risk giving too much because of what their companies demand from them.
                   But the same superiors who keep pressing you to do more, or to do it better, or faster,
                   or less expensively, will turn on you should you cross that fuzzy line between right and
                   wrong. They will blame you for exceeding instructions or for ignoring their warnings. The
                   smartest managers already know that the best answer to the question “How far is too far?”
                   is “Don’t try to find out.”1

               Does It Pay to Be Ethical?
               The Institute of Business Ethics (IBE) recently conducted a study titled “Does Business
               Ethics Pay?” and concluded that companies displaying a “clear commitment to ethical
               conduct” consistently outperform companies that do not display ethical conduct. Philippa
               Foster Black of the IBE stated, “Not only is ethical behavior in business the right thing to
               do in principle, it pays off in financial returns.” Table 10-1, on the following page, p­ rovides
               some results of the IBE study.
                    Research at DePaul University by Frigo and Litman suggests that it pays to be ethical.
               These researchers studied the financial performance of more than 15,000 public companies
               using 30 years of financial data and found that high-performing companies generally exhibit
               high business ethics.2 Similarly, results of a 7-year study by Fred Kiel, author of “Return on
               Character,” which followed 8,000 employees and 84 top executives of Fortune 500 companies,
               indicated that character-driven leaders deliver 5 times greater profitability results and 26 percent
               higher workforce engagement than self-focused leaders. Being unethical is a recipe for head-
               aches, inefficiency, and waste.

                                  TABLE 10-1 Seven Principles of Admirable Business Ethics

                                        1. Be trustworthy; no individual or business wants to engage in business with an organization it does
                                           not trust.
                                        2. Be open-minded, continually asking for “ethics-related feedback” from all internal and external
                                           stakeholders.
                                        3. Honor all commitments and obligations.
                                        4. Avoid misrepresenting, exaggerating, or misleading with print materials, actions, or words.
                                        5. Visibly be a responsible community citizen.
                                        6. Use your accounting practices to identify and eliminate questionable activities.
                                        7. Follow the Golden Rule: “Do unto others as you would have them do unto you.”

                                       Bad ethics can derail even the best strategic plans. Drucker explained the following in terms
                                  of ethical leadership:

                                     A man (or woman) might know too little, perform poorly, lack judgment and ability,
                                     and yet not do too much damage as a manager. But if that person lacks character and
                                     ­integrity—no matter how knowledgeable, how brilliant, how successful—he destroys. He
                                      destroys people, the most valuable resource of the enterprise. He destroys spirit. And he
                                      destroys performance. This is particularly true of the people at the head of an enterprise
                                      because the spirit of an organization is created from the top. If an organization is great
                                      in spirit, it is because the spirit of its top people is great. If it decays, it does so because
                                      the top rots. As the proverb states, “Trees die from the top.” No one should ever become
                                      a strategist unless he or she is willing to have his or her character serve as the model for
                                      subordinates.3

                                       Reverend Billy Graham once said, “When wealth is lost, nothing is lost; when health is lost,
                                  something is lost; when character is lost, all is lost.” An ethics “culture” needs to permeate orga-
                                  nizations. No society anywhere in the world can compete long-term or successfully with people
                                  stealing from one another or not trusting one another, with every bit of information requiring
                                  notarized confirmation, with every disagreement ending up in litigation, or with government
                                  having to regulate businesses to keep them honest. Recent examples of bad corporate cultures
                                  are Uber Technologies and Wells Fargo & Company where lawsuits specifically zeroed in on the
                                  firms’ culture.

                                  How to Establish an Ethics Culture
                                  A key ingredient for establishing an ethics culture is to develop a clear code of business ethics,
                                  however, simply having a code of ethics is not sufficient to ensure ethical business behavior.
                                  Managers must take care in considering the specific details of the content of the code, how it will
                                  be implemented, and how adherence to it will be monitored. Otherwise, a code of ethics may
                                  not even be read, understood, or believed by employees, and the code itself may well be viewed
                                  as a public relations gimmick, a set of platitudes, or window dressing. Once implemented, the
                                  code of ethics should be reinforced by showing employees examples of punishment for violating
                                  the code. The website www.ethicsweb.ca/codes provides guidelines on how to write an effective
                                  code of ethics.
                                       Companies should take active steps to ensure that the code is read, understood, believed,
                                  and remembered. Firms should consider implementing the following four practices recom-
                                  mended by Donald Palmer to minimize and deter ethical wrongdoings.4
                                   1.   Punish wrongdoing swiftly and severely when detected.
                                   2.   Hire employees who possess high ethical standards.
                                   3.   Develop socialization programs to reinforce desired cultural values.
                                   4.   Encourage subordinates to challenge questionable orders from superiors.

                    Companies are increasingly formalizing cultural oversight within the organization. For ex-
               ample, board members at Whirlpool closely monitor the firm’s culture through annual employee
               surveys, executive performance evaluations, and analysis of whistleblower activities. Citigroup
               and CACI International as well as many other firms have established formal committees de-
               signed to monitor corporate culture. To help create an ethics culture, Citicorp developed an in-
               teractive business ethics board game that is played by thousands of employees worldwide called
               “The Word Ethic.” This game asks players business ethics questions, such as “How do you deal
               with a customer who offers you football tickets in exchange for a new, backdated IRA?”
                    History has proven that the greater the trust and confidence of people in the ethics of an
               institution or society, the greater its economic strength. Business relationships are built mostly
               on mutual trust and reputation. Short-term decisions based on greed and questionable ethics will
               preclude the necessary self-respect to gain the trust of others. More and more firms believe that
               ethics training and an ethical culture can create strategic advantage. According to Max Killan,
               “If business is not based on ethical grounds, it is of no benefit to society, and will, like all other
               unethical combinations, pass into oblivion.” Several key ethical issues are discussed in greater
               detail in this chapter.
                    Being unethical is not abnormal or rare. Donald Palmer reports that misconduct is a nor-
               mal phenomenon, that wrongdoing is as prevalent as “rightdoing,” and that misconduct is most
               often done by people who are primarily good, ethical, and socially responsible.5 Palmer reports
               that individuals engage in unethical activities because of a plethora of structure, processes, and
               mechanisms inherent in the functioning of organizations—and, importantly, all of us are can-
               didates to be unethical in the right circumstances in any organization. Implications of this new
               research abound for managers.


               Whistle-Blowing, Bribery, and Workplace Romance                                                          LO 10.2
               As social media and technology have become commonplace globally, three business ethics
               ­topics—whistle-blowing, bribery, and workplace romance—have become important strategic
                issues facing companies. Missteps in any of these three areas can severely harm an organization.

               Whistle-Blowing
               Whistle-blowing refers to employees reporting any unethical violations they discover or see in
               the firm. Employees should practice whistle-blowing, and organizations should have policies
               that encourage whistle-blowing. Three individuals once received $170 million for helping inves-
               tigators obtain a record $16.65 billion penalty against Bank of America for inflating the value
               of mortgage properties and selling defective loans to investors. The whistle-blower payouts are
               among the highest ever in financial institution cases. Thousands of firms warn managers and
               employees that failing to report an ethical violation by others could bring discharge.
                    The Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) whistle-blowing policies virtu-
               ally mandate that anyone seeing unethical activity must report such behavior. The website
               www.whistleblower.org describes dozens of recent whistleblower cases and rewards to indi-
               viduals. Whistleblowers in the United States are protected under both the Sarbanes–Oxley and
               Dodd–Frank legislation.
                    Whistle-blowers in the corporate world receive up to 25 percent of the proceeds of legal
               proceedings against firms for wrongdoing. Such payouts are becoming more and more common.
               The SEC recently paid $30 million to a non-U.S. citizen whistle-blower who reported an ongo-
               ing fraud matter. Sean McKessy, the SEC’s whistle-blower top executive, commented about the
               case, “Whistleblowers from all over the world should feel similarly incentivized to come forward
               with credible information about potential violations of the U.S. securities laws.” Worldwide,
               local public opinion surveys indicate that Taiwan, Indonesia, Myanmar, and Portugal are the
               countries in which residents feel that it is the most socially acceptable to report witnessed cor-
               ruption; unfortunately, however, it still remains socially unacceptable in some countries, such as
               Armenia, Lithuania, Hungary, and Croatia, to report corruption that one witnesses.6
                    An accountant who recently tipped off the IRS that his employer was skimping on taxes
               received $4.5 million in the first IRS whistle-blower award. The accountant’s tip netted the IRS
               $20 million in taxes and interest from the errant financial services firm. The award represented

                                  scale cases, mandates awards of 15 to 30 percent of the amount recouped. “It’s a win–win
                                  for both the government and taxpayers. These are dollars that are being returned to the U.S.
                                  Treasury that otherwise wouldn’t be,” said lawyer Eric Young.
                                       Ethics training programs should include messages from the CEO or owner of the business
                                  emphasizing ethical business practices, discussing the codes of ethics, and detailing procedures
                                  for reporting unethical behavior. Firms can align ethical and strategic decision making by incor-
                                  porating ethical considerations into strategic planning, integrating ethical decision making into
                                  the performance-appraisal process, encouraging whistle-blowing, and monitoring departmental
                                  and corporate performance regarding ethical issues.

                                  Avoid Bribery
                                  Bribery is defined by Black’s Law Dictionary as the offering, giving, receiving, or soliciting of
                                  any item of value to influence the actions of an official or other person in discharge of a pub-
                                  lic or legal duty. A bribe is a gift bestowed to influence a recipient’s conduct. The gift may be
                                  money, goods, actions, property, preferment, privilege, object of value, advantage, or merely a
                                  promise or undertaking to induce the action, vote, or influence of a person in an official or pub-
                                  lic capacity.
                                       Bribery is a crime in most countries, including the United States. Even in sports, bribery
                                  is unlawful. Late in 2017, six basketball coaches at Division I universities and a top Adidas
                                  executive were among 10 people charged with crimes including bribery and fraud as part of
                                  a wide-ranging federal investigation into corruption in college basketball. Coaches at Auburn,
                                  Oklahoma State, Arizona, Louisville, Miami, and Southern California were accused of accepting
                                  bribes in exchange for offering to steer players to preferred financial advisers, business manag-
                                  ers, and agents. In this case, three Adidas executives were accused of arranging illicit payments
                                  for high school stars and their families to secure athlete commitments to Adidas-sponsored
                                  schools. These coaches were implicated in brokering deals between the Adidas executive and top
                                  basketball recruits.
                                       Countries with the lowest bribery rates include Japan, Hong Kong, South Korea,
                                  Mauritius, Botswana, and Cyprus; countries with the highest bribery rates include India,
                                  Liberia, and Vietnam.7 Anti-bribery and extortion initiatives are advocated by many global or-
                                  ganizations, including the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund, the European Union
                                  (EU), the Council of Europe, the Organization of American States, the Pacific Basin Economic
                                  Council, the Global Coalition for Africa, and the United Nations. Tipping is even now consid-
                                  ered bribery in some countries. Taking business associates to lavish dinners and giving them
                                  expensive holiday gifts and even outright cash may have been expected in some countries,
                                  such as South Korea and China, but there is now increased enforcement of bribery laws virtu-
                                  ally everywhere.
                                       Countries with the lowest corruption rates include Denmark, New Zealand, Finland,
                                  Sweden, Switzerland, Norway, Singapore, Netherlands, Canada, Germany, and the U.K. In con-
                                  trast, the most corrupt country is Somalia. Information such as this impacts company strategic
                                  decisions regarding where in the world to do business.

                                  Workplace Romance
                                  Workplace romance is an intimate relationship between two consenting employees, as opposed
                                  to sexual harassment, which the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) defines
                                  broadly as unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, and other verbal or physi-
                                  cal conduct of a sexual nature. Sexual harassment (and discrimination) is illegal, unethical, and
                                  detrimental to any organization and can result in expensive lawsuits, lower morale, and reduced
                                  productivity. The former head of Amazon Studios, Roy Price, recently resigned after a year-long
                                  old accusation of sexual harassment of a coworker became public.
                                       The entertainment and media industries were recently rocked by sexual harassment al-
                                  legations against public figures Harvey Weinstein, Kevin Spacey, Louis C. K., Mark Halperin,
                                  Charlie Rose, Matt Lauer, and Garrison Keillor. These and other revelations prompted the Wall
                                  Street Journal to publish a full two-page article titled “Is Office Romance Still Allowed?” The

                         •   33 percent of millennials view their workplace as a dating pool;
                         •   20 percent met their spouse or partner at work;
                         •   48 percent of women have personally experienced sexual harassment;
                         •   79 percent of women and 63 percent of men disagree that harassment reports are
                                exagerrated.
                    Workplace romance between two consenting employees simply happens, so the question
               is generally not whether to allow the practice, or even how to prevent it, but rather how best to
               manage it. A recent survey by CareerBuilder found that nearly 40 percent of workers have dated
               a coworker, and approximately 30 percent of those relationships resulted in marriage.8 An orga-
               nization should not strictly forbid workplace romance because such a policy could be construed
               as an invasion of privacy, overbearing, or unnecessary. Some romances actually improve work
               performance, adding a dynamism and energy that translates into enhanced morale, communica-
               tion, creativity, and productivity.9
                    However, workplace romance could be detrimental to workplace morale and productivity
               for a number of reasons that include:
                   1.   Favoritism complaints can arise.
                   2.   Confidentiality of records can be breached.
                   3.   Reduced quality and quantity of work can become a problem.
                   4.   Personal arguments can lead to work arguments.
                   5.   Whispering secrets can lead to tensions and hostilities among coworkers.
                   6.   Sexual harassment (or discrimination) charges may ensue.
                   7.   Conflicts of interest can arise, especially when the well-being of the partner trumps the
                        well-being of the company.
                    In some states, such as California, managers can be held personally liable for damages that
               arise from workplace romance. Organizations should establish guidelines and policies that ad-
               dress workplace romance, for at least six reasons:
                   1. Guidelines can enable the firm to better defend against and avoid sexual harassment or dis-
                      crimination charges.
                   2. Guidelines can specify reasons (such as the seven listed previously) why workplace ro-
                      mance may not be a good idea.
                   3. Guidelines can specify resultant penalties for romancing partners if problems arise.
                   4. Guidelines can promote a professional and fair work atmosphere.
                   5. Guidelines can help assure compliance with federal, state, and local laws, as well as recent
                      court cases.
                   6. Lack of any guidelines sends a lackadaisical message throughout the firm.
                    A Wall Street Journal article recaps U.S. standards regarding supervisor and subordinate
               romantic rlationships at work.10 The report reveals that only 5 percent of all firms sampled have
               no restrictions on such relationships; 80 percent of firms have policies that prohibit relationships
               between a supervisor and a subordinate; 4 percent of firms strictly prohibit all such relation-
               ships; 39 percent have policies that require individuals to inform their supervisors whenever a
               romantic relationship begins with a coworker; and 24 percent of firms require the two persons to
               be in different departments.
                    In Europe, romantic relationships at work are largely viewed as private matters and most
               firms have no policies on the practice. However, European firms are increasingly adopting ex-
               plicit, U.S.-style sexual harassment and workplace romance laws. The U.S. military strictly bans
               officers from dating or having sexual relationships with enlistees. At the World Bank, sexual
               relations between a supervisor and an employee are considered “a de facto conflict of interest
               which must be resolved to avoid favoritism.” Former World Bank president Paul Wolfowitz was
               forced to resign as a result of a relationship he had with a bank staff member.
                    In general, company guidelines or policies in general should discourage workplace romance
               because “the downside risks generally exceed the upside benefits” for the firm. Workplace ro-
               mance guidelines should specify certain situations in which affairs are especially discouraged,
               such as between a supervisor and subordinate, and should also detail the types of relationships
               allowed, such as between peer-level employees in different departments who also have different

                                              career paths. Importantly, the workplace romance policy guidelines should apply to all employ-
                                              ees at all levels of the firm and should clearly state the actions management will take if employ-
                                              ees violate any terms of the policy.
                                                   As a result of increasing sexual misconduct allegations across companies and organizations,
                                              more and more firms are requiring their employees to complete sexual harassment training. The
                                              large advertising firm Interpublic Group of Companies is having all of its 20,000 U.S. employ-
                                              ees complete sexual harassment training even though the firm has had no legal problems. Dell,
                                              Rockwell Automation, 21st Century Fox, ESPN, and Facebook are other firms initiating sexual
                                              harassment training for employees. Most universities require all faculty to complete training re-
                                              garding how to handle situations where a student mentions experiencing some forms of sexual ha-
                                              rassment by another student, faculty, or staff member. U.S. laws require that faculty report any in-
                                              stance, claim, or even suggestion of sexual harassment from a student to university administrators.


                             LO 10.3          Environmental Sustainability
                                              The ecological challenge facing all organizations requires managers to formulate strategies
                                              that preserve and conserve natural resources and control pollution. Special natural environ-
                                              ment issues include global warming, depletion of rain forests, destruction of animal habitats,
                                              protecting endangered species, and waste management. Firms are increasingly developing
                                              green product lines that are biodegradable or made from recycled products. Managing the
                                              health of the planet requires an understanding of how international trade, competitiveness,
                                              and global resources are connected. Managing environmental affairs, for example, can no lon-
                                              ger be simply a technical function performed by specialists in a firm; more emphasis must be
                                              placed on developing an environmental perspective among all employees and managers of the
                                              firm. Many firms in India have a problem with this issue, as mentioned in Global Capsule 10.
                                                   Businesses must not exploit and decimate the natural environment. Mark Starik at George
                                              Washington University believes, “Halting and reversing worldwide ecological destruction and
                                              deterioration is a strategic issue that needs immediate and substantive attention by all businesses
                                              and managers.” According to the International Standards Organization, the word environment
                                              is defined as surroundings in which an organization operates, including air, water, land, natural
                                              resources, flora, fauna, humans, and their interrelation. Many firms are gaining competitive ad-
                                              vantage by being good stewards of the natural environment. Green products sell well.
                                                   Employees, consumers, governments, and societies are often resentful of firms that harm
                                              rather than protect the natural environment. Conversely, people today are especially appreciative

        GLOBAL CAPSULE 10
       India Is Turning Garbage into Cash
       The Indian city of Mysuru (formerly Mysore) is leading the way for all
       of India to turn its garbage into compost and energy. India generates
       about 62 million tons of solid waster every year and that amount is
       expected to increase fivefold by 2051, so the country is revamping how
       it handles garbage. Currently only about 28 percent of India’s garbage
       is treated and processed out of the 82 percent that is actually collected.
                                                                                                                                                           Muan simte/123RF




       The other 18 percent that is not collected at all ends up in drains, wa-
       terways, landfills, and/or is consumed by animals. But in Mysuru, 50
       percent of garbage is turned into compost and another 25 percent is
       recycled. India’s Modi administration currently has 56 waste-to-energy
       power plants under construction and has installed incentives and re-
       quirements for all municipalities in India to handle their garbage more
       effectively and efficiently. Other cities in India leading the way on turn-   Source: Based on Bibhudatta Pradhan, “Can India Turn Garbage Into Cash?”

               Sustainability Reports and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)
               A sustainability report reveals how a firm’s operations impact the natural environment. This
               document discloses to shareholders information about the firm’s labor practices, product
               sourcing, energy efficiency, environmental impact, and business ethics practices. For example,
               Coca-Cola’s annual sustainability reports are provided online at http://www.coca-colacompany
               .com/stories/sustainability-reports.
                    No business wants the reputation of being a polluter. For the first time ever in the United
               States, cars, trucks, planes, and trains have displaced power plants as the biggest polluters. This
               trend is accelerating, as the nation’s electrical grid gets cleaner faster than the transportation means.
                    A bad sustainability record will hurt any firm in any market, jeopardize its stand-
               ing in the community, and invite scrutiny by regulators, investors, and environmentalists.
               Governments increasingly require businesses to behave responsibly and require, for example,
               that businesses publicly report the pollutants and wastes their facilities produce. It is simply
               good business for any organization to provide a sustainability report annually to the public.
               The Global Reporting Initiative provides a set of detailed reporting guidelines specifying what
               information should go into sustainability reports (https://www.globalreporting.org/information/
               sustainability-reporting/Pages/default.aspx).
                    The proxy advisory firm Institutional Shareholder Services reports that an increasing num-
               ber of shareholder groups are pushing firms to provide sustainability information annually. With
               60,000 suppliers and more than $350 billion in annual sales, Walmart works with its suppliers
               to make sure they provide such reports. Many firms use the Walmart sustainability report as a
               benchmark or model to follow in preparing their own report.
                    Around the world, political and corporate leaders now realize that the “green business”
               topic is not going away and in fact is gaining ground rapidly. A few years ago, firms could get
               away with placing “green” terminology on their products and labels, using such terms as or-
               ganic, green, safe, earth-friendly, nontoxic, or natural because there were no legal or formally
               accepted definitions. Today, however, these terms carry much more specific connotations and
               expectations. Uniform standards defining environmentally responsible company actions are rap-
               idly being incorporated into the legal landscape. Strategically, companies more than ever must
               demonstrate to their customers and stakeholders that their green efforts are substantive and set
               the firm apart from competitors. A firm’s social performance (facts and figures) must back up its
               rhetoric and be consistent with sustainability standards.
                    Many companies are moving the corporate environmental group to report directly to the
               CEO. Firms that manage environmental affairs will enhance relations with consumers, regula-
               tors, vendors, and other industry players, substantially improving their prospects of success.
               Environmental strategies could include the following:
                1.   Developing or acquiring green businesses
                2.   Divesting or altering environment-damaging businesses
                3.   Becoming a low-cost producer through waste minimization and energy conservation
                4.   Pursuing a differentiation strategy through green product features
                5.   Including an environmental or sustainability representative on their board of directors
                6.   Conducting regular environmental audits
                7.   Implementing bonuses for favorable environmental or conservation-related results
                8.   Becoming involved in environmental issues and programs
                9.   Incorporating environmental values in mission statements
               10.   Establishing environmentally oriented objectives
               11.   Acquiring “green” skills
               12.   Providing environmental training programs for company employees and managers.
                    Through its Green Power Partnership, the EPA works with organizations to increase the use
               of green power as a percentage of total electricity use. Table 10-2 and Table 10-3, on the follow-
               ing pages, reveal the top 15 “green” retailers and universities, respectively, based on kilowatts
               (KWh) of green power used annually. (Note: Green power is renewable, such as wind, solar, and
               water, as opposed to fossil fuels, such as oil, gas, and coal that are not renewable). Note below
               that Kohl’s and the University of Tennessee at Knoxville are the total KWh green-power usage
               leaders for retail companies and higher education institutions, respectively. Many commercial
               and residential builders now offer solar panels as standard equipment on homes and offices.

                                  International Standardization Organization (ISO) Certification
                                  Based in Geneva, Switzerland, the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) is a
                                  network of national standards institutes of 162 countries, with one member per country. The
                                  ISO is the world’s largest developer of sustainability standards. ISO has published nearly 22,000
                                  international standards covering almost every industry, from healthcare to agriculture to food
                                  safety to technology. ISO standards reveal “required” specifications for products, services, and
                                  systems to ensure quality, safety, and efficiency; ISO standards facilitate international trade and
                                  commerce.
                                       Widely accepted all over the world, ISO standards are voluntary because the organization
                                  itself does not regulate or legislate. Governmental agencies in various countries, such as the U.S.
                                  EPA, have adopted ISO standards as part of their regulatory framework, and the standards are
                                  the basis of much legislation. Adoptions are sovereign decisions by the regulatory authorities,
                                  governments, or companies concerned. Businesses and municipalities should consider becoming
                                  ISO certified to help attract business.
                                       ISO 14000 refers to a series of voluntary standards in the environmental field. The ISO
                                  14000 family of standards concerns the extent to which a firm minimizes harmful effects on the
                                  environment caused by its activities and continually monitors and improves its own environmen-
                                  tal performance. These standards have been adopted by thousands of firms and municipalities
                                  worldwide to certify to their constituencies that they are conducting business in an environmen-
                                  tally friendly manner; these standards offer a universal technical benchmark for environmental
                                  compliance that more and more firms are requiring not only of themselves but also of their sup-
                                  pliers and distributors. Included in the ISO 14000 series are the ISO 14001 standards in fields

               such as environmental auditing, environmental performance evaluation, pollution prevention,
               environmental labeling, and life-cycle assessment. According to the ISO 14001 standard, a
               community or organization is required to put in place and implement a series of practices and
               procedures that, when taken together, result in an environmental management system (EMS).
               Not being certified with ISO 14001 can be a strategic disadvantage for towns, counties, and
               companies because people today expect organizations to minimize or, even better, to eliminate
               environmental harm they cause.
                   Preserving the environment should be a permanent part of doing business, for the following
               reasons:
                   1. Consumer demand for environmentally safe products and packages is high.
                   2. Public opinion demanding that firms conduct business in ways that preserve the natural
                      environment is strong.
                   3. Environmental advocacy groups now have more than 20 million Americans as members.
                   4. Federal and state environmental regulations are changing rapidly and becoming more
                      complex.

                                       5. More lenders are examining the environmental liabilities of businesses seeking loans.
                                       6. Many consumers, suppliers, distributors, and investors shun doing business with environ-
                                          mentally weak firms.
                                       7. Liability suits and fines against firms having environmental problems are on the rise.
                                           Table 10-4 reveals the impact that bad environmental policies have on songbirds and coral
                                      reefs, two of nature’s many ecosystems.


                                      TABLE 10-4 Songbirds and Coral Reefs Need Help
                                       Songbirds
                                       Being a good steward of the natural environment can help save our songbirds. Bluebirds are one of 76
                                       songbird species in the United States that have dramatically declined in numbers in the last two decades.
                                       Not all birds are considered songbirds, and why birds sing is not clear. Some scientists say they sing
                                       when calling for mates or warning of danger; other scientists contend that birds sing for sheer pleasure.
                                       Songbirds include chickadees, orioles, swallows, mockingbirds, warblers, sparrows, vireos, and the wood
                                       thrush. “These birds are telling us there’s a problem, something’s out of balance in our environment,” says
                                       Jeff Wells, bird conservation director for the National Audubon Society. Songbirds may be telling us that
                                       their air or water is too dirty or that we are destroying too much of their habitat. People collect Picasso
                                       paintings and save historic buildings. “Songbirds are part of our natural heritage. Why should we be willing
                                       to watch songbirds be destroyed any more than allowing a great work of art to be destroyed?” asks Wells.
                                       Whatever message songbirds are singing to us today about their natural environment, the message is be-
                                       coming less and less heard nationwide. Listen when you go outside today. Each of us as individuals, com-
                                       panies, states, and countries should do what we reasonably can to help improve the natural environment for
                                       songbirds.11 Many companies now make it a point to keep/maintain “green” areas on their properties.
                                       Coral Reefs
                                       Being a good steward of the natural environment can help save our coral reefs. Oceans cover more than
                                       71 percent of the Earth. Although coral reefs occupy only 1 percent of the world’s marine system, they
                                       are home to more than a quarter of marine species, including unique fish, turtles and algae, all of which
                                       depend on the reef for survival. The destructive effect of commercial fishing on ocean habitats coupled
                                       with increasing pollution runoff into oceans, as well as global warming, have decimated fisheries, ma-
                                       rine life, and coral reefs around the world. The unfortunate consequence of fishing over the last century
                                       has been overfishing, with the principal reasons being politics and greed. Trawl fishing with nets de-
                                       stroys coral reefs and has been compared to catching squirrels by cutting down forests because bottom
                                       nets scour and destroy vast areas of the ocean. Warming of the ocean as a result of carbon dioxide emis-
                                       sions also kills thousands of acres of coral reefs annually. The total area of fully protected marine habi-
                                       tats in the United States is only about 50 square miles, compared to some 93 million acres of national
                                       wildlife refuges and national parks on the nation’s land.12



                            LO 10.4   Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR)
                                      Social responsibility refers to a firm’s obligation to care for its employees, customers, com-
                                      munities, and society in which it operates. For example, the food seasoning firm McCormick &
                                      Company states that its corporate social responsibility (CSR) goals for 2025 include working to
                                      “improve the health and well-being of all people, building resilience in communities around the
                                      world and positively impacting the environment.” Some strategists agree with Ralph Nader, who
                                      proclaims that organizations have tremendous social obligations. Nader points out, for example,
                                      that ExxonMobil has more assets than most countries, and because of this, such firms have an
                                      obligation to help society cure its many ills. Other people, however, agree with the economist
                                      Milton Friedman, who asserts that organizations have no obligation to do any more for society
                                      than is legally required. Friedman may contend that it is irresponsible for a firm to give monies
                                      to charity.
                                           Do you agree more with Nader or Friedman? Surely we can all agree that the first social re-
                                      sponsibility of any business must be to make enough profit to cover the firm’s costs of the future,
                                      because if this is not achieved, no other social responsibility can be met. Indeed, no social need
                                      can be met if the firm fails. Many economists suggest that firms should not engage much, if any,
                                      in philanthropy because simply making a profit is difficult, and shareholders expect a high return
                                      on their investment. However, substantial research reveals a u-shaped relationship between CSR

               and corporate financial performance, whereby firms with the greatest CSR are generally also
               the firms with the highest financial performance; firms with the lowest CSR tend to have higher
               performance than those with moderate social responsibility.
                    Strategists should examine social problems in terms of potential costs and benefits to the
               firm and focus on social issues that could benefit the firm most. For example, if a firm avoids
               cutting jobs to protect employees’ livelihood, and that decision forces the firm to liquidate, then
               all the employees lose their jobs. Walmart selectively engages in social responsibility efforts
               that directly complement its business initiatives. For example, between 2017 and 2021, Walmart
               will reportedly contribute more than $20 million to disaster relief and prevention efforts. As
               evidenced in the Ethics Capsule 10, an exemplary company regarding social responsibility is

               cially responsible.

               CSR extends to the 9-plus billion land animals raised in the United States annually for food;
               many of these animals live their short lives in inhumane factory-like structures. Animal wel-
               fare concerns are on the rise among consumers; retailers are beginning to respond to such
               concerns by increasingly demanding that food suppliers provide humane treatment of ani-
               mals. A recent study by market research firm Packaged Facts revealed that more than half of
               U.S. consumers are significantly more concerned with livestock welfare than they have been
               in past years. The report explained how animal welfare and the humane treatment of ani-
               mals raised for food will soon become a new standard shaped by next-generation consumer
               expectations.
                    A large-scale survey by the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals
               (ASPCA) found that U.S. consumers (67 percent to be exact) are demanding meat, eggs, and
               dairy products that have higher welfare standards, even if it means paying more for the prod-
               ucts. ASPCA believes that “animals are entitled to kind and respectful treatment at the hands
               of humans and must be protected under the law.” Recent video footage at Florida-based Larson
               Dairy showed workers kicking cows and striking them with metal rods; the Okeechobee County
               Sheriff’s Office launched an investigation and Publix Supermarkets stopped taking milk deliver-
               ies from Larson.
                    Policies aimed at improving livestock welfare are increasingly being developed and
               approved by lawmakers around the world. In addition to newly emerging, more stringent

                                  regulations surrounding livestock welfare, substantive scientific research studies are beginning
                                  to reveal significant financial benefits of enhanced animal welfare guidelines. For example, heat
                                  stress and rough handling often lower the quality, safety, and value of livestock by bruising the
                                  meat, reducing growth, and even inhibiting reproduction. As a result, large food companies such
                                  as Whole Foods, Bon Appetit, Sodexo, and Aramark have implemented more animal-friendly
                                  policies.
                                       Pete Stanton and Gerry LaFlamme, founder of the largest free-range egg producer in the
                                  United States, Pete & Gerry’s Organic Eggs, offered suggestions for companies seeking to grow
                                  sustainable humane practices:

                                     Build your brands and company on a mission that you fully believe in, your employees
                                     believe in, and most importantly, your customers can believe in. The mission of the busi-
                                     ness may not be the reason people buy your product, but it should be the reason they can
                                     believe in who you are and in your brand. For your employees, a strong mission is critical;
                                     anyone can work at a job, but not everyone is fortunate enough to work on something that
                                     is meaningful, that offers them a sense of pride and accomplishment. The mission of your
                                     business should be the engine and the fuel that keeps you moving ahead, even during dif-

                                  Wildlife Welfare
                                  CSR also extends to wildlife. Consumers globally are becoming increasingly intolerant of any
                                  business or nation that directly or indirectly destroys wildlife, especially endangered wildlife,
                                  such as tigers, elephants, whales, songbirds, and coral reefs. Affected businesses range from
                                  retailers that sell ivory chess pieces to restaurants that sell whale meat. Many New Zealanders,
                                  supported by Australians, are outraged about Japan’s large-scale whaling operations in the
                                  Antarctic. In a recent annual Antarctic hunt, Japanese whaling fleets caught and killed nearly
                                  500 whales as part of a “research project on the ecological system in the Antarctic Sea and
                                  Northwest Pacific.” Ironically, Japan is a member of the International Whaling Commission
                                  that has banned commercial whaling in a 50-million-square-mile-area around Antarctica
                                  known as the Southern Ocean Whale Sanctuary. Only a few countries—such as Norway,
                                  Iceland, and Japan—favor and engage in commercial whaling. Norway has been criticized
                                  globally in recent years for continuously launching whale-hunting expeditions and killing
                                  more than 700 minke whales each year, many of them pregnant females. Countries, municipal-
                                  ities, and companies run the risk of being boycotted and exposed for direct or indirect wildlife
                                  endangering practices.
                                        Nearly 100 million sharks are killed each year solely to cut off (and sell) their fins.14
                                  Although “shark-finning” was outlawed in U.S. waters in 2000, the law does not ban fin im-
                                  ports or serving the fins in food, resulting in about 65 metric tons of fins being imported in the
                                  United States annually. Only eight U.S. states have laws banning the sale of shark fins in food:
                                  Hawaii, Oregon, Washington, Illinois, California, Maryland, New York, and Delaware. The prob-
                                  lem is much worse in some countries, especially China, which is the world’s largest consumer
                                  of shark fins. Most of the shark fins are used to make the delicacy, shark fin soup, which can
                                  sell for nearly $100 per bowl. A pair of shark fins can sell for as much as $700 per kilogram in
                                  Asia. More than 30 percent of the world’s shark species now face extinction, according to the
                                  International Union for Conservation of Nature because sharks are being killed almost 30 per-
                                  cent faster than they can reproduce.
                                        A spokesperson for the Foundation for National Parks and Wildlife in Australia says
                                  koala populations are down from 100,000 a few years ago to just 40,000 now. Forest fires,
                                  ­stress-induced diseases, and business development have crushed koala bear populations. When
                                   the marsupial bears leave their trees to relocate, they are often killed by predators and vehicles.
                                   Experts say the bears will be extinct by 2040 unless something is done now.

                   Firms should strive to engage in social activities that have economic benefits. Merck & Co.
               once developed the drug ivermectin for treating river blindness, a disease caused by a fly-borne
               parasitic worm endemic in poor tropical areas of Africa, the Middle East, and Latin America.
               In an unprecedented gesture that reflected its corporate commitment to social responsibility,
               Merck then made ivermectin available at no cost to medical personnel throughout the world.
               Merck’s action highlights the dilemma of orphan drugs, which offer pharmaceutical companies
               no economic incentive for profitable development and distribution. Merck did, however, garner
               substantial favor among its stakeholders for its actions. Firms are becoming more proactive by
               doing more than the bare minimum to develop and implement strategies that preserve the envi-

               Chapter Summary
               In a final analysis, ethical standards come out of history and heritage. Our predecessors left us
               with an ethical foundation on which to build. Even the legendary football coach Vince Lombardi
               knew that some things were worth more than winning, and he required his players to have
               three kinds of loyalty: to God, to their families, and to the Green Bay Packers, “in that order.”
               Employees, customers, and shareholders have become less and less tolerant of ethical violations
               in firms, and more and more appreciative of model ethical firms. Information sharing across the
               Internet increasingly reveals such model firms versus irresponsible firms.
                     Consumers across the country and around the world appreciate firms that do more than is
               legally required to be socially responsible. But staying in business, while adhering to all laws
               and regulations, must be a primary objective of any business. One of the best ways to be socially
               responsible is for the firm to proactively conserve and preserve the natural environment. For
               example, developing a corporate sustainability report annually is not legally required, but such a
               report, based on concrete actions, goes a long way toward assuring stakeholders that the firm is
               worthy of their support. Business ethics, social responsibility, and environmental sustainability

               What Is My Business Ethics Quotient?
               Purpose
               This chapter reveals that being unethical is not abnormal or rare. Misconduct is a normal phe-
               nomenon and wrongdoing is as prevalent as “rightdoing,” Misconduct is most often done by
               people who are primarily good, ethical, and socially responsible. Palmer reports that individuals
               engage in unethical activities because of a plethora of structure, processes, and mechanisms in-
               herent in the functioning of organizations, and, importantly, all of us are candidates to be unethi-
               cal under the right circumstances in any organization. Implications of this new research abound
               for managers.
                   The purpose of this exercise is to determine your business ethics quotient. We can use the word
               quotient to refer to the extent that your behavior and attitude are good or bad compared to your fellow
               business students. In this exercise, your business ethics quotient can range from very bad (total score
               of 16) to very good (total score of 80). (Donald Palmer, “The New Perspective on Organizational
               Wrongdoing,” California Managment Review, 56, no. 1 (2013): 5–23).
               Instructions
               Step 1             Rate your personal behavior and attitude on the following dimensions on a 1- to 5-scale
                                  where 1 is really bad, 2 is bad, 3 is OK, 4 is good, and 5 is really good. Beside each word
                                  given, rate yourself compared to your fellow business students.
                   1.    Trustworthy
                   2.    Reliable
                   3.    Dependable

                   15.   Helpful
                   16.   Giving
               Step 2             Sum your ratings to determine your total business ethics quotient score. Are you pleased
                                  with your score? Do you need to improve your score? How can you improve your score?
                                  Would a business thinking of hiring you be pleased with your score?

                                  Purpose
                                  This chapter discusses workplace romance as being potentially detrimental to workplace morale and
                                  productivity, for a number of reasons that include:
                                   1. Favoritism complaints can arise.
                                   2. Confidentiality of records can be breached.
                                   3. Reduced quality and quantity of work can become a problem.
                                   4. Personal arguments can lead to work arguments.
                                   5. Whispering secrets can lead to tensions and hostilities among coworkers.
                                   6. Sexual harassment (or discrimination) charges may ensue, either by the involved person or a
                                      third party.
                                   7. Conflicts of interest can arise, especially when wellbeing of the partner trumps wellbeing of the
                                      firm.
                                      The purpose of this exercise is to examine more closely the reasons why workplace romance can
                                  cause problems. In addition, the purpose of this exercise is to examine whether individual decision
                                  making is better than group decision making. Academic research suggests that groups make better
                                  decisions than individuals about 80 percent of the time.
                                  Instructions
                                  Rank the seven reasons why workplace romance can cause problems as to their relative importance
                                  (potential severity), where 1 = most important, to 7 = least important). Use Table 10-6. First, rank the
                                  reasons as an individual. Then, rank the seven reasons as part of a group of three. Thus, determine
                                  what person(s) and what group(s) here today can come closest to the expert ranking. This exercise

                                  tegic planning.
                                  Steps
                                   1. Fill in Column 1 in Table 10-6 to reveal your individual ranking of the relative importance of
                                      the seven reasons (1= most important, 2 = next most important, etc.) in terms of how potentially
                                      damaging each reason can be. For example, if you think Reason #1 (Favoritism) is the eighth-
                                      most important (potentially severe) reason, then enter an 8 in Table 1 in Column 1 beside
                                      Favoritism.
                                   2. Fill in Column 2 in Table 10-6 to reveal your group’s ranking of the relative importance of the
                                      seven reasons (1= most important, 2 = next most important, etc.) in terms of how potentially
                                      damaging each reason can be.
                                   3. Fill in Column 3 in Table 10-6 to reveal the expert’s ranking of the seven reasons in terms of
                                      how potentially damaging each reason can be.
                                   4. Fill in Column 4 in Table 10-6 to reveal the absolute difference between Column 1 and Column
                                      3 to reveal how well you performed as an individual in this exercise. (Note: Absolute difference
                                      disregards negative numbers.)
                                   5. Fill in Column 5 in Table 10-6 to reveal the absolute difference between Column 2 and Column
                                      3 to reveal how well your group performed in this exercise.
                                   6. Sum Column 4. Sum Column 5.
                                   7. Compare the Column 4 sum with the Column 5 sum. If your Column 4 sum is less than your Column
                                      5 sum, then you performed better as an individual than as a group. Normally, group decision making
                                      is superior to individual decision making, so if you did better than your group, you did excellent.
                                   8. The Individual Winner(s): The individual(s) with the lowest Column 4 sum is the WINNER.
                                   9. The Group Winners(s): The group(s) with the lowest Column 5 score is the WINNER.

                 MINI-CASE ON CHICK-FIL-A

               WHAT COMPANY HAS THE MOST ETHICAL
               BUSINESS CULTURE?




                                                                                                                                                 Jurgenfr/Shutterstock
               The answer: Chick-fil-A. Headquartered in Atlanta, Georgia, Chick-fil-A is a privately-held com-
               pany that prides itself on demonstrating high business ethics, anchored by being closed once a
               week to spend time with family and friends. Despite being closed one-seventh of the time, Chick-
               fil-A has surpassed Kentucky Fried Chicken (KFC) as the largest chicken quick-service restau-
               rant (QSR) in the United States by revenue. This is shocking because there are only about 2,200
               Chick-fil-A’s in the nation, compared to KFC’s 4,500. Total annual revenues for Chick-fil-A are
               about $5 billion.
                   Each Chick-fil-A restaurant averages more than $4.4 million in annual sales, more than three
               times KFC’s average at $1 million. In fact, Chick-fil-A’s average sales per restaurant is highest of all
               restaurants in the United States, with the number two chain being Whataburger, which generates $2.7
               million per restaurant, a mere 61 percent of Chick-Fil-A. In terms of direct chicken restaurant rival
               firms, Chick-fil-A dominates in annual per-restaurant sales, toppling direct competitors Zaxby’s ($2.3
               million), El Pollo Loco ($1.9 million), Bojangles’ ($1.8 million), Popeyes ($1.4 million), Boston
               Market ($1.4 million), and Wingstop ($1.1 million).
                   About 65 percent of Check-fil-A’s business is through its drive-thru where employees stand
               outside the restaurant taking orders on tablets. Research shows that Chick-fil-A employees say
               “thank you” 97 percent of the time; customers report that employees have a pleasant demeanor
               and smile in 9 out of 10 visits. The company’s employee retention rate is exceptionally high.
               Chick-fil-A has the second-highest rate of accuracy at the drive-thru of all restaurants, getting
               orders right 95 percent of the time, second only to Carl’s Jr.’s accuracy rate of 97 percent, in a
               recent study.
                   The only aspect of business where Chick-fil-A does not rank highly is in speed of service. The
               average wait time at Chick-fil-A’s drive thru is 4 minutes and 16 seconds, which is about 31 seconds
               longer than the average drive-thru wait time. But all in all, Chick-fil-A is an exemplary triple-bottom-
               line company.

                                     Questions
                                      1.   Describe the business culture at Chick-fil-A.
                                      2.   To what extent does Chick-fil-A’s culture account for Chick-fil-A’s performance?
                                      3.   How would you grade Chick-fil-A’s triple-bottom-line? Why?
                                      4.   Should Chick-fil-A change its policy and be open on Sundays since all its major rivals are open
                                           on Sunday? Why or why not?

                                                   our imaginations. To see and appreciate the world from the perspective of others has be-
                                          come a matter of survival for many businesses. To survive and grow, more and more companies
                                          are monitoring and capitalizing on changes in competitors, markets, prices, suppliers, distribu-
                                          tors, governments, creditors, shareholders, and customers worldwide.
                                               The price and quality of a firm’s products must be competitive on a worldwide basis, not
                                          just on a local basis. Shareholders expect substantial revenue growth; doing business globally is
                                          an excellent way to achieve this end. More and more countries are developing the capacity and
                                          will to compete aggressively in world markets. Foreign businesses and countries are willing to
                                          learn, adapt, innovate, and invent to compete successfully on a global scale. As indicated in the
                                          exemplary strategist capsule, CEO Andre Calantzopoulos is leading his company to succeed
                                          globally.


                             LO 11.1      The Nature of Doing Business Globally
                                          Exports of goods and services from the United States account for only 13 percent of U.S. gross
                                          domestic product (GDP), so the nation is still largely a domestic, continental economy. In con-
                                          trast, as a percentage of GDP, exports comprise 46 percent of the German economy, 20 percent
                                          of the Chinese economy, and 172 percent of the Singapore economy. Singapore’s number is so
                                          high because it imports oil and other products and then reexports them globally. A point here is
                                          that, with exports making up just 13 percent of the country’s GDP, the United States has substan-
                                          tial room for improvement in doing business.
                                                A world market has emerged from what previously was a multitude of distinct national mar-
                                          kets, and the climate for international business today is more favorable than in years past. Mass
                                          communication and high technology have created similar patterns of consumption across diverse
                                          cultures worldwide. Consequently, companies may find it difficult to survive by relying solely
                                          on domestic markets.
                                                Globalization is a process of doing business worldwide, such that strategic decisions are
                                          made based on global profitability of the firm rather than just domestic considerations. A global
                                          strategy seeks to meet the needs of customers worldwide, with the highest value at the lowest

    of Philip Morris International
                                                                                                                                                          Stockfotocz/123RF
    Andre Calantzopoulos, CEO of Philip Morris, is actively shifting con-
    sumers worldwide to a smokeless tobacco product, that heats but
    does not burn tobacco. The product is much less harmful than regular
    cigarettes and electric (e) cigarettes. Calantzopoulos has pledged $1
    billion to create a foundation to encourage every smoker to switch to
    the company’s smoke-free alternative. Calantzopoulos’s new smoke-
    less strategic plan at Philip Morris is based on the premise that most              There Is an Alternative!
    smokers have two unmet needs: (1) they want something not per-
    sonally harmful, and (2) they want something that does not bother
    others. The company plans to spend billions on R&D to develop new         save millions of lives and trillions of dollars (in health-care costs) if his
    smokeless cigarette-like products and market those products glob-         strategic plan continues to be successful. Let’s all wish this exemplary
    ally. A smokeless tobacco starter kit costs a bit more than $100, but     strategist the best of luck.
    is selling really well. Philip Morris’ revenues and profits are growing
    nicely with Calantzopoulos leading the way, even as rival traditional     Source: Based on Saabira Chaudhuri, “Behind Philip Morris International’s

               cost. This may mean locating production in countries with lower labor costs or abundant natural
               resources, locating research and complex engineering centers where skilled scientists and engi-
               neers can be found, and locating marketing activities close to the markets to be served.
                     A global strategy includes designing, producing, and marketing products with global needs
               in mind rather than considering just a home country. A global strategy integrates actions against
               competitors into a worldwide plan. Today, many global buyers and sellers have mastered capa-
               bilities for instant transmission of money and information across continents.
                     In any industry that is global, it can be a risky posture to remain a domestic competitor,
               because more aggressive rival firms may use global growth to capture economies of scale and
               learning. The domestic firm could then face an attack on domestic markets using different
               (and possibly superior) technology, product design, manufacturing, marketing approaches, and
               economies of scale. As a point of global reference, the five largest companies in nine different
               countries are listed in Table 11-1, (as determined from “equally weighted measures of revenue,

               Multinational Firms
               Organizations that conduct business operations across national borders are called international
               (or multinational) firms. The strategic-management process is conceptually the same for multi-
               national firms as for purely domestic firms; however, the process is more complex as a result of
               more variables and relationships. The external opportunities and threats that face multinational
               firms are almost limitless, and the number and complexity of these factors increase dramatically
               with the number of products produced and the number of geographic areas served. Millions of
               small businesses do business everyday outside their home country by interacting with customers
               though websites, smartphones, and social media.
                    More time and effort are required to identify and evaluate external trends and events in
               multinational firms. Geographic distance, cultural and national differences, and variations in
               business practices often make communication between domestic headquarters and overseas
               operations difficult. Strategy implementation can be more difficult because different cultures
               have different norms, values, and work ethics. Multinational firms face unique and diverse risks,
               such as expropriation of assets, currency losses through exchange rate fluctuations, unfavorable

                                  foreign court interpretations of contracts and agreements, social/political disturbances, import/
                                  export restrictions, tariffs, and trade barriers. Strategists in global firms are often confronted
                                  with the need to be globally competitive and nationally responsive at the same time. With the
                                  rise in world commerce, government and regulatory bodies are more closely monitoring foreign
                                  business practices. The U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, for example, monitors business
                                  practices in many areas.
                                       Before entering international markets, firms should scan relevant journals and patent re-
                                  ports, seek the advice of academic and research organizations, participate in international trade
                                  fairs, form partnerships, and conduct extensive research to broaden their contacts and diminish
                                  the risk of doing business in new markets. Firms can also offset some risks of doing business
                                  internationally by obtaining insurance from the U.S. government’s Overseas Private Investment
                                  Corporation (OPIC).
                                       The decision to expand operations into foreign markets—that is, to globalize—is one of
                                  the most important strategic decisions made by companies. Variables that influence how, when,
                                  where, and why to internationalize have attracted much attention in scholarly journals. Recent
                                  research reveals that countries are attractive not only because of their own institutions but also
                                  as a function of their serving as a platform for entry into other regions.1 Therefore, multinational
                                  firms make globalization decisions with special consideration in mind for how a particular re-
                                  gion or country will facilitate the firm’s further globalization into other regions and countries.
                                  Also important is the need to align any strategy with a firm’s vision and mission and an assess-
                                  ment of the potential to gain and sustain competitive advantages.
                                       U.S.-based multinational firms have historically kept cash earned offshore in foreign sub-
                                  sidiaries and banks to avoid high U.S. corporate taxes. However, this changed in 2018 with the
                                  new federal corporate tax overhaul. The new U.S. federal tax law that went into effect in 2018
                                  imposed a one-time 15.5 percent tax on foreign earnings held offshore in cash accounts, whether
                                  the firm brings the cash back to the United States or not. The law is designed to encourage com-
                                  panies to bring cash back to the United States. Numerous companies, such as Apple Inc., have
                                  billions of dollars in cash offshore, and many, perhaps most, of those firms are indeed bringing
                                  that cash back into the United States. So, what are those firms doing with the cash? About 70
                                  percent of the cash repatriated by companies is going towards stock buybacks and paying divi-
                                  dends, with the remaining amount going to investments in company infrastructure and employ-
                                  ees. For example, Apple in recent years bought back 5 percent of its stock, but in the beginning
                                  of 2018, that percentage rose to 7 percent annually. The huge transfer of cash from outside com-
                                  pany coffers to inside U.S. investments from 2018 to 2022 is expected to spur the U.S. economy,
                                  boost the stock market, and lead to increased employee wages and benefits.


                                  Labor Unions
                                  The existence or prevalence of labor unions can be an important factor in many strategic deci-
                                  sions, such as where to locate stores or factories because companies often like to avoid unions.
                                  The presence of unions raises wage rates for companies. Union membership varies widely
                                  across Europe, ranging from 74 percent of employees in Finland, 70 percent in Sweden, 67
                                  percent in Denmark, and 8 percent in Lithuania and France. In general, the popularity of unions
                                  across Europe is declining and has been for a decade. The major exception to this trend is Italy
                                  where union membership is slowly growing.
                                       The average level of union membership across the whole of the European Union (EU),
                                  weighted by the numbers employed in the different member states is 23 percent, compared to
                                  about 11 percent in the United States. The European average is held down by relatively low
                                  levels of membership in some of the larger EU states: Germany with 18 percent, France with 8
                                  percent, Spain with 19 percent, and Poland with 12 percent.


                                  Tax Rates
                                  Tax rates in countries can represent an important strategic consideration regarding where to build
                                  manufacturing facilities or retail stores or even where to acquire other firms. High corporate tax
                                  rates deter investment in new factories and also provide strong incentives for corporations to
                                  avoid and evade taxes. Corporate tax rates vary considerably across countries and companies.

               Across 190 countries on the planet, the average corporate income tax rate is about 22 percent.
               The average corporate tax rate across Europe is 18 percent. The average corporate rate globally
               has been falling annually since 1980 when the average was 38 percent. Hungary reduced their
               corporate tax rate from 19 to 9 percent in 2017. The United States cut its top statutory corporate
               tax in 2018 to 21 percent, the lowest rate among the Group of Seven (G7) nations, which include
               Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States.
                    As indicated in Table 11-2, the top national statutory corporate tax rates in 2018 among
               sample countries ranged from 0 percent in Bermuda to 55 percent in the United Arab Emirates
               (UAE). Signet Jewelers Ltd., owner of Kay’s Jewelers, Zale Corporation, and Jared the Galleria
               of Jewelry, is headquartered in Bermuda for one key strategic reason: zero corporate taxes.

               Advantages and Disadvantages of Doing Business                                                          LO 11.2
               Globally
               Firms have numerous reasons for formulating and implementing strategies that initiate, con-
               tinue, or expand involvement in business operations across national borders. Perhaps the greatest
               advantage is that firms can gain new customers for their products and services, thus increasing
               revenues. Growth in revenues and profits is a common organizational objective and often an ex-
               pectation of shareholders because it is a measure of organizational success. Potential advantages
               to initiating, continuing, or expanding international operations are as follows:
                   1. Firms can gain new customers for their products.
                   2. Foreign operations can absorb excess capacity, reduce unit costs, and spread economic
                      risks over a wider number of markets.

                                        3. Foreign operations can allow firms to establish low-cost production facilities in locations
                                           close to raw materials or cheap labor.
                                        4. Competitors in foreign markets may not exist, or competition may be less intense than in
                                           domestic markets.
                                        5. Foreign operations may result in reduced tariffs, lower taxes, and favorable political
                                           treatment.
                                        6. Multinational joint ventures can enable firms to learn the technology, culture, and business
                                           practices of other people and to make contacts with potential customers, suppliers, credi-
                                           tors, and distributors in foreign countries.
                                        7. Economies of scale can be better achieved from operation in global rather than solely do-
                                           mestic markets. Larger-scale production and better efficiencies allow higher sales volumes
                                           and lower-price offerings.
                                        8. A firm’s power and prestige in domestic markets may be significantly enhanced if the
                                           firm competes globally. Enhanced prestige can translate into improved negotiating power
                                           among creditors, suppliers, distributors, and other important groups.
                                           The availability, depth, and reliability of economic and marketing information in different
                                       countries vary extensively, as do industrial structures, business practices, and the number and
                                       nature of regional organizations. There are also numerous potential disadvantages of initiating,
                                       continuing, or expanding business across national borders, such as the following:
                                        1. Foreign operations could be seized by nationalistic factions.
                                        2. Firms confront different and often little-understood social, cultural, demographic, envi-
                                           ronmental, political, governmental, legal, technological, economic, and competitive forces
                                           when doing business internationally.
                                        3. Weaknesses of competitors in foreign lands are often overestimated, and strengths are often
                                           underestimated. Keeping informed about the number and nature of competitors is more dif-
                                           ficult when doing business internationally.
                                        4. Language, culture, and value systems differ among countries, which can create barriers to
                                           communication and problems managing people.
                                        5. Gaining an understanding of regional organizations such as the European Economic
                                           Community, the Latin American Free Trade Area, the International Bank for
                                           Reconstruction and Development, and the International Finance Corporation is difficult,
                                           but is often required in doing business internationally.
                                        6. Dealing with two or more monetary systems can complicate international business
                                           operations.



                             LO 11.3   The Global Challenge
                                       Few companies can afford to ignore the presence of international competition. Firms that seem
                                       insulated and comfortable today may be vulnerable tomorrow; for example, foreign banks do
                                       not yet compete or operate in most of the United States, but this is quickly changing. Thomson
                                       Reuters annually compiles a list of the world’s most innovative companies, using metrics that
                                       include patent activity, R&D investment, success rate, globalization, and influence. In terms

                                       States led the world with $16.1, $13.9, and $12.7 billion spent, respectively, but Samsung in
                                       South Korea ($12.7B), Volkswagen in Germany ($12.1B), Roche Holding AG in Switzerland
                                       ($11.4B), Novartis AG in Switzerland ($9.6B), and Toyota Motor in Japan ($9.3B) were other
                                       firms in the top 11. Other outside U.S. firms that spend more than $5 billion annually in R&D
                                       include Daimler AG (Germany), Honda Motor (Japan), AstraZeneca PLC (Britain), Siemens
                                       (Germany), and Sanofi (France).
                                            The U.S. economy is becoming much less American and more global. A globalzed world
                                       economy and monetary system are emerging. Corporations in every corner of the globe are
                                       taking advantage of the opportunity to obtain customers globally. Markets are shifting rapidly
                                       and, in many cases, converging in tastes, trends, and prices. Innovative transport systems are
                                       accelerating the transfer of technology. Shifts in the nature and location of production systems,

               especially to China and India, are reducing the response time associated with changing market
               conditions. China has more than one billion residents, including a dramatically growing middle
               class that is eager to buy goods and services.
                     Many countries are quite protectionist, and this position can impact companies’ strategic
               plans. Protectionism refers to countries imposing tariffs, taxes, and regulations on firms
               outside the country to favor their own companies and people. The U.S. and China in early
               2018 are imposing various tariffs on each other’s products imported. Most economists argue
               that protectionism harms the world economy because it inhibits trade among countries and
               invites retaliation.
                     Advancements in telecommunications are drawing countries, cultures, and organizations
               worldwide closer together. Foreign revenue as a percentage of total company revenues already
               exceeds 50 percent in hundreds of U.S. firms, including ExxonMobil, Gillette, Dow Chemical,
               Citicorp, Colgate-Palmolive, and Texaco. A primary reason why most domestic firms do busi-
               ness globally is that growth in demand for goods outside the U.S. is considerably higher than in-
               side. For example, the domestic food industry is growing just 3 percent per year, so Kraft Foods,
               the second-largest food company in the world behind Nestlé, is focusing on foreign acquisitions.
               Shareholders and investors of virtually all companies expect sustained (more than 5 percent)
               growth in revenues from firms; that level of growth for many firms can only be achieved by capi-
               talizing on demand outside the United States. Joint ventures and partnerships between domestic
               and foreign firms are becoming the rule rather than the exception!
                     Fully 95 percent of the world’s population lives outside the United States, and this group
               is growing 70 percent faster than the U.S. population. The lineup of competitors in virtually
               all industries is global. General Motors and Ford compete with Toyota and Hyundai. General
               Electric and Westinghouse Electric battle Siemens and Mitsubishi. Caterpillar and John
               Deere compete with Komatsu. Goodyear battles Michelin, Bridgestone/Firestone, and Pirelli.
               Boeing competes with Airbus. Only a few U.S. industries—such as furniture, printing, retail-
               ing, ­consumer-packaged goods, and retail banking—are not yet greatly challenged by foreign
               competitors. But many products and components in these industries too are now manufactured
               in foreign countries. International operations can be as simple as exporting a product to a single
               foreign country or as complex as operating manufacturing, distribution, and marketing facilities
               in many countries.
                     Different industries become global for different reasons. The need to amortize massive
               R&D investments over many markets is a major reason why the aircraft manufacturing industry
               became global. Monitoring globalization in one’s industry is an important strategic-management
               activity. Knowing how to use that information for one’s competitive advantage is even more
               important. For example, firms may look around the world for the best technology and select one
               that has the most promise for the largest number of markets. When firms design a product, they
               design it to be marketable in as many countries as possible. When firms manufacture a product,
               they select the lowest-cost source, which may be Japan for semiconductors, Sri Lanka for tex-
               tiles, Malaysia for simple electronics, and Europe for precision machinery.


               Outsourcing and Reshoring
               Outsourcing involves companies hiring other companies to take over various parts of their func-
               tional operations, such as human resources, information systems, payroll, accounting, customer
               service, and even marketing. The outsourcing business is booming. According to an analysis
               by S&P Global Market Intelligence, 5 of the top 20 global employers in 2017 were outsourc-
               ing firms that essentially lease workers to clients, led by Compass Group PLC and Accenture
               PLC; the annual value on outsourcing contracts grew to more than $40 billion in 2017 from
               $12.5 billion in 2000, according to research and advisory firm Information Services Group Inc.
               Outsourcing made up 46 percent of Accenture’s revenues in 2017.
                    For more than a decade, U.S. and European companies have been outsourcing their manu-
               facturing, tech support, and back-office work, but most insisted on keeping R&D activities in-
               house. However, an ever-growing number of firms today are outsourcing their product design to
               Asian developers. China and India have become important suppliers of intellectual property. The
               details of what work to outsource, to whom, where, and for how much can challenge even the

                                       TABLE 11-3 Potential Benefits of Outsourcing
                                          1. Cost savings: Access lower wages in foreign countries.
                                          2. Focus on core business: Focus resources on developing the core business rather than being dis-
                                              tracted by other functions.
                                          3. Cost restructuring: Outsourcing changes the balance of fixed costs to variable costs by moving the
                                              firm more to variable costs.
                                          4. Improve quality: Improve quality by contracting out various business functions to specialists.
                                          5. Knowledge: Gain access to intellectual property and wider experience and knowledge.
                                          6. Contract: Gain access to services within a legally binding contract with financial penalties and
                                              legal redress. This is not the case with services performed internally.
                                          7. Access to talent: Gain access to a larger talent pool and a sustainable source of skills, especially
                                              science and engineering.
                                          8. Catalyst for change: Use an outsourcing agreement as a catalyst for major change that cannot be
                                              achieved alone.
                                          9. Reduce time to market: Accelerate development or production of a product through additional
                                              capability brought by the supplier.
                                         10. Risk management: Manage risk by partnering with an outside firm.
                                         11. Tax benefit: Capitalize on tax incentives to locate manufacturing plants to avoid high taxes in vari-
                                              ous countries.



                                       biggest, most sophisticated companies. India is a booming place for outsourcing. China requires
                                       many firms to share their technological knowledge as a condition of doing business in that coun-
                                       try; this is a growing problem for U.S. firms and America in general.
                                             Table 11-3 reveals potential benefits that firms strive to achieve through outsourcing. Notice
                                       from the first benefit that outsourcing is often used to access lower wages in foreign countries.
                                             Reshoring refers to U.S. companies moving a portion of their manufacturing back to the
                                       United States. The Donald Trump administration is spurring and rewarding reshoring. Many
                                       U.S. companies plan to reshore in 2018–2020 to take advantage of new U.S. tax laws, to get
                                       products to market faster and respond rapidly to customer orders, to save from reduced transpor-
                                       tation and warehousing, and to improve quality and protection of intellectual property. “Made in
                                       the USA” is making a comeback. For example, the Italian firm Fiat Chrysler Automobiles N.V.
                                       in 2018 moved production of its large Ram Heavy Duty trucks from Saltillo, Mexico to Warren,
                                       Michigan. The move created 2,500 new jobs in Warren.
                                             The strength of the dollar, however, has led some U.S. firms to look outside the United
                                       States to produce goods. The high value of the dollar makes U.S. goods more expensive overseas
                                       and makes imports to the United States cheaper. Overall however, benefits of reshoring are as
                                       follows:
                                        1. U.S. laws protect female and minority employees
                                        2. Reliable energy at low cost
                                        3. Excellent security to protect designs from overseas copycats
                                        4. Enable closer tabs on quality control and supply chains
                                        5. Excellent economy with consumers purchasing more
                                        6. Less shipment costs with consumers nearby
                                        7. Excellent human rights, education, legal, and political systems that promote freedom and
                                           opportunity for citizens
                                        8. Capitalize on the new 21 percent corporate tax rate



                             LO 11.4   U.S. versus Foreign Business Culture
                                       To be successful in world markets, U.S. managers must obtain a better knowledge of historical, cul-
                                       tural, and religious forces that motivate and drive people in other countries. For multinational firms,
                                       knowledge of business culture variation across countries can be essential for gaining and sustaining
                                       competitive advantage. An excellent website to visit on this topic is www.worldbusinessculture.com,

               where you may select any country in the world and check out how business culture varies in that
               country versus other lands. In Japan, for example, business relations operate within the context of
               Wa, which stresses group harmony and social cohesion. In China, business behavior revolves around
               guanxi, or personal relations. In South Korea, activities involve concern for inhwa, or h­ armony-based
               on respect of hierarchical relationships, including obedience to authority.
                    A weakness of some U.S. firms in competing with Pacific Rim firms is a lack of un-
               derstanding of Asian cultures, including how Asians think and behave. Spoken Chinese, for
               example, has more in common with spoken English than with spoken Japanese or Korean.
               U.S. managers consistently put more weight on being friendly and liked, whereas Asian and
               European managers often exercise authority without this concern. Americans tend to use first
               names instantly in business dealings with foreigners, but foreigners find this presumptuous.
               In Japan, for example, first names are used only among family members and intimate friends;
               even longtime business associates and coworkers shy away from the use of first names.
               Table 11-4 lists other cultural differences or pitfalls that U.S. managers may benefit from
               considering.

               TABLE 11-4 Cultural Pitfalls That May Help You Be a Better Manager
                   •   Waving is a serious insult in Greece and Nigeria, particularly if the hand is near someone’s face.
                   •   Making a “good-bye” wave in Europe can mean “No,” but it means “Come here” in Peru.
                   •   In China, last names are written first.
                   •   A man named Carlos Lopez-Garcia should be addressed as Mr. Lopez in Latin America but as
                       Mr. Garcia in Brazil.
                   •   Breakfast meetings are considered uncivilized in most foreign countries.
                   •   Latin Americans are, on average, 20 minutes late to business appointments.
                   •   Direct eye contact is impolite in Japan.
                   •   Do not cross your legs in any Arab or many Asian countries because it is rude to show the sole of
                       your shoe.
                   •   In Brazil, touching your thumb and first finger—an American “Okay” sign—is the equivalent of rais-
                       ing your middle finger.
                   •   Nodding or tossing your head back in southern Italy, Malta, Greece, and Tunisia means “No.” In
                       India, this body motion means “Yes.”
                   •   Snapping your fingers is vulgar in France and Belgium.
                   •   Folding your arms across your chest is a sign of annoyance in Finland.
                   •   In China, leave some food on your plate to show that your host was so generous that you could not
                       finish.
                   •   Do not eat with your left hand when dining with clients from Malaysia or India.
                   •   One form of communication works the same worldwide. It is the smile; so take that along wherever
                       you go.

                    Managers from the United States place greater emphasis on short-term results than do for-
               eign managers. In marketing, for example, Japanese managers strive to achieve “everlasting cus-
               tomers,” whereas many Americans strive to make a one-time sale. Marketing managers in Japan
               see making a sale as the beginning, not the end, of the selling process. This is an important dis-
               tinction. Japanese managers often criticize U.S. managers for worrying more about sharehold-
               ers, whom they do not know, than employees, whom they do know. Americans refer to “hourly
               employees,” whereas many Japanese companies still refer to “lifetime employees.”
                    Rose Knotts summarized some important cultural differences between U.S. and foreign
               managers.2 Awareness and consideration of these differences can enable a manager to be more
               effective, regardless of his or her own nationality.
                   1. Americans place an exceptionally high priority on time, viewing time as an asset and
                      ­punctuality as vital. Many foreigners place more worth on family and relationships. This dif-
                       ference results in foreign managers often viewing U.S. managers as “more interested in busi-
                       ness than people.”
                   2. Personal touching and distance norms differ around the world. Americans generally stand
                       about 3 feet from each other when carrying on business conversations, but Arabs and

                                        Africans stand about 1 foot apart. Touching another person with the left hand in business
                                        dealings is taboo in some countries.
                                   3.   Family roles and relationships vary in different countries. For example, males are valued
                                        more than females in some cultures, and peer pressure, work situations, and business inter-
                                        actions reinforce this phenomenon.
                                   4.   Business and daily life in some societies are governed by religious factors. Prayer times,
                                        holidays, daily events, and dietary restrictions, for example, need to be respected by man-
                                        agers regardless of their own nationality and cultural norms.
                                   5.   Many cultures around the world value modesty, team spirit, collectivity, and patience much
                                        more than competitiveness and individualism, which are so important in the United States.
                                   6.   Eating habits also differ dramatically across cultures. For example, belching is acceptable
                                        in some countries as evidence of satisfaction with the food that has been prepared. Chinese
                                        culture considers it good manners to sample a portion of each food served.
                                   7.   To prevent social blunders when meeting with managers from other lands, one must learn
                                        and respect the rules of etiquette of others. Sitting on a toilet seat is viewed as unsanitary in
                                        some countries, but not in the United States. Leaving food or drink after dining is consid-
                                        ered impolite in some countries, but not in China. Bowing instead of shaking hands is cus-
                                        tomary in many countries. Some cultures view Americans as unsanitary for locating toilet
                                        and bathing facilities in the same area, whereas Americans view people of some cultures as
                                        unsanitary for not taking a bath or shower every day.
                                   8.   Americans often do business with individuals they do not know, unlike businesspersons in
                                        many other cultures. In Mexico and Japan, for example, an amicable relationship is often
                                        mandatory before conducting business.
                                        In many countries, effective managers are those who are best at negotiating with govern-
                                  ment bureaucrats, rather than those who inspire workers. The United States provides legal pro-
                                  tection against sexual harassment and discrimination based on race, sexual orientation, religion,
                                  and so on, but not all countries offer the same legal protections. U.S. managers in China have to
                                  be careful about how they arrange office furniture because Chinese workers believe in feng shui,
                                  the practice of harnessing natural forces. Also, U.S. managers in Japan have to be careful about
                                  nemaswashio, whereby Japanese workers expect supervisors to alert them privately of changes
                                  rather than informing them in a meeting. Japanese managers have little appreciation for versatil-
                                  ity, expecting all managers to be the same. In Japan, “If a nail sticks out, you hit it into the wall,”
                                  says Brad Lashbrook, an international consultant for Wilson Learning.
                                        Probably the biggest obstacle to managers from any country working in another is the
                                  fact that it is almost impossible to change the attitude of an international workforce. “The sys-
                                  tem drives you; you cannot fight the system or culture,” says Bill Parker, president of Phillips
                                  Petroleum in Norway. For example, in the Middle East, be careful of alcohol and pork, because
                                  many Muslims do not eat pork or drink alcohol. In India, cows are revered, so no leather gifts.

                                  Communication Differences across Countries
                                  Communication may be the most important word in strategic management. Americans increas-
                                  ingly interact with managers in other countries, so it is important to understand communication
                                  differences across countries. Americans sometimes come across as intrusive, manipulative, and
                                  garrulous; this impression may reduce their effectiveness in communication. Asian managers
                                  view extended periods of silence as important for organizing and evaluating one’s thoughts,
                                  whereas U.S. managers have a low tolerance for silence. Sitting through a conference without
                                  talking is unproductive in the United States, but may be viewed as positive in Japan as one’s si-
                                  lence helps preserve unity. Managers from the United States are much more action-oriented than
                                  their counterparts around the world; they rush to appointments, conferences, and meetings—and
                                  then feel the day has been productive. But for many foreign managers, resting, listening, medi-
                                  tating, and thinking is considered productive.
                                       Most Japanese managers are reserved, quiet, distant, introspective, and others-oriented,
                                  whereas most U.S. managers are talkative, insensitive, impulsive, direct, and i­ ndividual-oriented.
                                  Unlike Japanese managers, U.S. managers often use blunt criticism, ask prying questions,
                                  and make quick decisions. These kinds of communication differences have disrupted many

               potentially productive Japanese–U.S. business endeavors. Viewing the Japanese communication
               style as a prototype for all Asian cultures is a stereotype that must be avoided.
                    Like many Asian and African cultures, the Japanese are nonconfrontational. They have a
               difficult time saying “no,” so you must be vigilant at observing their nonverbal communica-
               tion. Rarely refuse a request, no matter how difficult or nonprofitable it may appear at the time.
               In communicating with Japanese, phrase questions so that they can answer yes—for example,
               “Do you disagree with this?” Group decision-making and consensus are vitally important. The
               Japanese often remain silent in meetings for long periods of time and may even close their eyes
               when they want to listen intently.


               Business Culture across Countries3                                                                                          LO 11.5
               Managers, marketers, salespersons, and virtually all businesspersons can be more effective in
               doing business with persons and companies in other countries if they have an understanding and
               appreciation of business culture variation across countries. One aspect of business culture com-
               mon across countries is appreciation for excellent customer service. Airlines fly people from na-
               tion to nation all over the world. Ethics Capsule 11 examines customer service ratings of airlines
               and asks the question “does bad customer service equate to bad business ethics?”
                    For a flavor of how cultures vary across continents, let’s examine four countries: Mexico,
               Japan, China, and India.

               Mexico
               Mexico is an authoritarian society in terms of schools, churches, businesses, and families. In
               general, employers seek workers who are agreeable, respectful, and obedient, rather than innova-
               tive, creative, and independent. When visitors walk into a Mexican business, they are met with a
               cordial, friendly atmosphere. This is almost always true because Mexicans desire harmony rather
               than conflict; desire for harmony is part of the social fabric in worker–manager relations. There
               is a much lower tolerance for adversarial relations or friction at work in Mexico than in the U.S.
                    Mexican employers are more likely to provide weekly food baskets, free meals, free bus
               service, and free day care. The ideal working condition for a Mexican worker is the family
               model, with people all working together, doing their share, according to their designated roles.
               Mexican workers do not expect or desire a work environment in which self-expression and
               initiative are encouraged. U.S. business embodies individualism, achievement, competition,

                                  whereas Mexican businesses stress collectivism, continuity, cooperation, belongingness, for-
                                  mality, and doing exactly what is told. Meeting times for appointments are not rigid. Tardiness
                                  is common everywhere. Effectively doing business in Mexico requires knowledge of the
                                  Mexican way of life, culture, beliefs, and customs. Do not get irritated at the lack of punctuality
                                  in Mexico.

                                  Japan
                                  Japan’s workforce population ages 15 to 64 is declining about 500,000 each year, so the country
                                  is facing its tightest labor market in 40 years. This shift toward an older population has forced
                                  Japan to increasingly open its doors to immigrant workers, which has increased demand for
                                  housing and international goods. The world’s third-largest economy, Japan is undergoing an eco-
                                  nomic turnaround where business confidence is approaching its highest point in decades.
                                        Because of its dwindling workforce and aging population, Japan is increasingly promoting
                                  women into managerial positions. Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan has proclaimed a goal
                                  to fill 30 percent of leadership positions in Japan with women by 2020. Abe recently filled five
                                  open positions in his own cabinet with women. A key reason that Japanese women have histori-
                                  cally not advanced to managerial positions is the business culture of notorious long work hours.
                                        The Japanese people place great importance on group loyalty and consensus—a concept
                                  called Wa. Corporate activities in Japan encourage Wa among managers and employees. Wa
                                  requires that all members of a group agree and cooperate; this results in constant discussion and
                                  compromise. Japanese managers evaluate the potential attractiveness of alternative business de-
                                  cisions in terms of the long-term effect on the group’s Wa. This is why silence, used for ponder-
                                  ing alternatives, can be a plus in a formal Japanese meeting. Discussions potentially disruptive
                                  to Wa are generally conducted in informal settings, such as at a bar, so as to minimize harm to
                                  the group’s Wa. Entertaining is an important business activity in Japan because it strengthens
                                  Wa. Formal meetings are often conducted in informal settings. When confronted with disturb-
                                  ing questions or opinions, Japanese managers tend to remain silent, whereas Americans tend to
                                  respond directly, defending themselves through explanation and argument.
                                        In Japan, a person’s age and status are of paramount importance, whether in the family unit,
                                  the extended family, or a social or business situation. Schoolchildren learn early that the oldest
                                  person in the group is to be honored. Older folks are served first and their drinks are poured for
                                  them. Greetings in Japan are formal and ritualized, so wait to be introduced because it may be
                                  viewed as impolite to introduce yourself, even in a large gathering. Foreigners may shake hands,
                                  but the traditional form of greeting in Japan is to bow. The deeper you bow, the more respect you
                                  show, but at least bow the head slightly in greetings.
                                        In Japan, build and maintain relationships by sending greeting, thank-you, birthday, and
                                  seasonal cards. You need to be a good “correspondent” to effectively do business with the
                                  Japanese. Punctuality is important, so arrive on time for meetings and be mindful that it may
                                  take several meetings to establish a good relationship. The Japanese are looking for a long-term
                                  relationship. Always give a small gift as a token of your appreciation, and present it to the most
                                  senior person at the end of any meeting.
                                        Business cards are exchanged in Japan constantly and with excitement. Invest in quality
                                  business cards and keep them in pristine condition. Do not write on them. Have one side of your
                                  card translated in Japanese and give it to the person with the Japanese side facing the recipient.
                                  Business cards are generally given and received with two hands and a slight bow. Examine any
                                  business card you receive carefully.

                                  China
                                  In China, greetings are formal and the oldest person is always greeted first. Like in the United
                                  States, handshakes are the most common form of greeting. Many Chinese will look toward the
                                  ground when greeting someone. The Chinese have an excellent sense of humor, often laughing
                                  at themselves if they have a comfortable relationship with the other person. Never give clocks,
                                  handkerchiefs, flowers, or straw sandals because they are associated with funerals. Do not wrap
                                  gifts in white, blue, or black paper. In China, the number 4 is unlucky, so do not give four of any-
                                  thing. Eight is the luckiest number, so giving eight of something is a great idea.

                    The Chinese rarely do business with companies or people they do not know. Your position
               on an organizational chart is extremely important in business relationships. Gender bias is gener-
               ally not an issue. Meals and social events are not the place for business discussions. There is a
               demarcation between business and socializing in China, so try to be careful not to intertwine the
               two. Like in the U. S. and Germany, punctuality is important in China. Arriving late to a meeting
               is an insult and could negatively affect your relationship. Meetings require patience because mo-
               bile phones ring frequently and conversations may be boisterous. Never ask the Chinese to turn
               off their mobile phones because this causes you both to lose face.

               India
               India’s rate of female participation in the labor force is about 35 percent, which is quite low,
               especially considering that women make up about 42 percent of college graduates in India.
               Even Indian women with a college degree are expected to let their careers take a back seat to
               caring for their husband, children, and elderly parents. “The measures of daughterly guilt are
               much higher in Indian women than in other countries,” says Sylvia Ann Hewlett, president of
               the Center for Work-Life Policy, a Manhattan think tank, who headed a recent study on the chal-
               lenges Indian women face in the workplace.4 Hewlett adds, “Since taking care of elderly parents
               usually becomes a reality later in a woman’s career, it takes them out of the workplace just when
               they should be entering top management roles.” That is why gender disparities at Indian compa-
               nies unfortunately grow more pronounced at higher levels of management.
                     Like in many Asian cultures, people in India do not like to say no, verbally or nonverbally.
               Rather than disappoint you, they often will say something is not available, will offer you the
               response that they think you want to hear, or will be vague with you. This behavior should not
               be considered dishonest. Shaking hands is common in India, especially in the large cities among
               the more educated who are accustomed to dealing with westerners. Men may shake hands with
               other men and women may shake hands with other women; however, there are seldom hand-
               shakes between men and women because of religious beliefs.
                     Be mindful that neither Hindus nor Sikhs eat beef, and many are vegetarians. Lamb,
               chicken, and fish are the most commonly served main courses. Table manners are somewhat
               formal, but much Indian food is eaten with the fingers. Like most places in the world, wait to be
               told where and when to sit at dinner. Women in India typically serve the men and eat later. You
               may be asked to wash your hands before and after sitting down to a meal. Always use your right
               hand to eat, whether using utensils or your fingers. Leave a small amount of food on your plate
               to indicate that you are satisfied. Finishing all your food means that you are still hungry, which
               is true in Egypt, China, Mexico, and many countries.
                     Indians prefer to do business with those with whom they have established a relationship
               built on mutual trust and respect. Punctuality is important. Indians generally do not trust the le-
               gal system, and someone’s word is often sufficient to reach an agreement. Do not disagree pub-
               licly with anyone in India. Titles such as professor, doctor, or engineer are important in India, as
               is a person’s age, university degree, caste, and profession. Use the right hand to give and receive
               business cards. Business cards need not be translated into Hindi but always present your busi-
               ness card so the recipient may read the card as it is handed to him or her. This is a nice, expected
               gesture in most countries around the world.

               Among 20,000 companies listed on stock exchanges around the world, FactSet reported in
               December 2017 that companies’ EPS on average was $9.69 for 2017—up 19 percent over the
               prior year and the highest level ever recorded—evidence of a booming economy globally.5
               Similarly, the Citigroup Global Economic Surprise Index that measures the extent that com-
               panies are beating or missing analysts’ expectations, reports more “beating” than in a decade
               prior—for both emerging and developing markets. The International Monetary Fund reported
               that international trade growth grew 4 percent in 2017, up from 2.4 percent in the prior year. EPS
               for China’s Tencent Holdings Ltd. grew 55 percent in 2017; South Korea’s Samsung Electronics’
               EPS grew 95 percent. Analysts project continued corporate prosperity in 2018–2020 barring any
               global conflicts or extraneous occurrences.

                                       The World Bank and the International Finance Corporation annually rank 189 coun-
                                  tries in terms of their respective ease of doing business (http://www.doingbusiness.org/
                                  rankings). The index ranks nations from 1 (best) to 189 (worst). For each nation, the ranking
                                  is calculated as the simple average of the percentile rankings on how easy is it to (1) start a
                                  business, (2) deal with construction permits, (3) register property, (4) get credit, (5) protect
                                  investors, (6) pay taxes, (7) trade across borders, (8) enforce contracts, (9) resolve insol-
                                  vency, and (10) get electricity.
                                       Table 11-5 reveals the 2018 “Ease of Doing Business” rankings for the top 10 nations in
                                  six regions of the world. Note, for example, that Norway is rated the sixth-best country on the

                                       In 2018, the U.S. economy is the strongest that it has been in more than a decade.
                                  Unemployment is at record lows (below 4 percent), inflation is low, gas prices are low, inter-
                                  est rates are rising, the stock market is booming, and optimism is exceptionally high. The
                                  19 countries in Europe that use the euro reported late in 2017 that their economy is improving
                                  more than it has in 17 years. The European Commission’s economic sentiment indicator rose to
                                  114.0 in October 2017, its highest level in 8 years. For a flavor of how business climate varies
                                  globally, let’s examine several regions, because more and more companies are locating employ-
                                  ees and facilities globally.

                                  The African Continent
                                  About 30 African countries are considered democracies. Currencies in Africa are stabilizing and
                                  many countries are fundraising to build modern highways, ports, and power grids. Many non-
                                  African companies are launching operations in Africa because of the rapidly growing middle
                                  class and an average GDP growth of 5 percent for the continent through 2020. Morocco has the
                                  highest Internet penetration among all countries in Africa, with more than 50 percent. On aver-
                                  age however, fewer than 20 percent of Africans have access to the Internet. McKinsey predicts

                    Many multinational firms are now gaining first-mover advantages by engaging Africa at all levels.
               Today, more than 40 percent of Africans live in the cities—a proportion close to China and India. The
               general global image of Africa is rapidly changing to that of millions of smartphone-carrying consum-
               ers in cities purchasing products. Africa has the world’s largest deposits of platinum, chrome, and
               diamonds, and many Chinese companies in particular are investing there.

               China
               As the world’s most populous country, China’s economic output annually exceeds the United
               States. Hundreds of companies are scurrying to set up business in China. All 31 Chinese prov-
               inces and regions recently boosted their minimum wage for the third consecutive year. Demand
               for workers in China now outstrips supply, and this is contributing to rapidly rising wage rates
               and worldwide inflation. Commercial and industrial development in China’s west has turned
               interior cities such as Chongqing into production centers that compete for labor with coastal
               factories. China ranks about 90th out of 190 countries in terms of doing business. That ranking is
               relatively low for a variety of reasons, ranging from human-rights issues to substantial disregard
               for copyright, patent, and trademark rules of law.
                    China’s new cybersecurity law requires that foreign technology firms store their data inside
               China and allow the government to keep tabs on how firms use the technology. Chinese law also
               requires foreign companies that want to enter various industries such as energy and telecom to
               do so through joint ventures. Often these ventures lead to China gaining the technology of the
               United States and other countries. China is encouraging companies from all over the world to
               set up R&D operations there; Apple, Amazon, Microsoft, and Google have done so, including
               Google’s new Artificial Intelligence Center. As indicated in the Global Capsule 11, China is on a
               mission to gain technological superiority among all nations in the next decade, through quantum
               computing, artificial intelligence, robotics, and cybersecurity.
                    China accounts for nearly one-third of the global market for cars, so the country is in a good
               position to lead the market of electric cars. China accounted for nearly half of the world’s sales
               of electric cars in 2016, with sales reaching over 351,000. Ford recently set a goal, that by 2025,
               70 percent of its Chinese cars will be electric.

               Indonesia
               A democratic Pacific archipelago comprised of thousands of islands, Indonesia’s currency is the
               rupiah and its economy is one of the fastest growing in Asia, behind China and the Philippines.
               Indonesia’s GDP growth is 5 percent in 2017 and growing. Exports are surging in Indonesia.
               Indonesia has a large population and densely populated regions; Indonesia also has the world’s
               second-highest level of biodiversity, with vast areas of wilderness and abundant natural resources.
                    In 2018–2019, Indonesia has made remarkable progress across a broad range of economic and
               social dimensions. Health, education, standards of living, and other social outcomes have never been
               better in Indonesia. The government of Indonesia is closer than ever to the people. As a member
               of the G20, Indonesia is actively engaged in world affairs, and economic integration with regional
               Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) partners is moving ahead. The economic forecast
               for Indonesia is very bright—its population is young, the domestic market is large, it has a rich en-
               dowment of natural resources, public debt is low, and its political system is broad based and stable.

               India
               The World Bank’s annual report “Doing Business 2017: Equal Opportunity for All” reported
               that India moved up only one spot to 130 from 131 the prior year in terms of its ranking among
               all countries as per ease of doing business. Among the BRICS nations, Brazil (123), Russia (40),
               India (130), China (78), and South Africa (74), India was ranked lowest; however, has made sub-
               stantial progress in some areas such as electricity connections but has slipped in other areas such
               as payment of taxes and enforcing contracts.
                    Online activity has accelerated in India partly because of the exceptionally low $5 per month
               unlimited access to high-speed Internet on a smartphone. In 2017, India replaced the United States
               as the country that downloaded more apps from Google’s Play Store than any other on the planet.
               Google has a booming business in India, yet the company is not allowed to do any business in China.

                                            South Korea’s Kia Motors just built a $1 billion assembly near Monterrey, Mexico, joining Mazda

                                            have automobile assembly operations to Mexico. Mexico is the fourth-largest exporter and seventh-
                                            largest producer of automobiles in the world. Mexico’s auto industry now employs one of every
                                            six Mexican factory workers and comprises one-third of all exports from Mexico. Mexico is also
                                            the world’s largest exporter of flat screen televisions. Mexico’s exports and production of vehicles
                                            were up 12 and 9.4 percent, respectively for the first 11 months of 2017 compared to the prior year.
                                            In 2020, Ford’s new electric vehicle manufacturing plant in Cuautitlan, Mexico, will be completed.
                                                 Foreign direct investment (FDI) in Mexico has surged to exceed $30 billion annually, led by

                                                 Mexico is especially attractive for manufacturing products that are bulky or costly to transport,
                                            such as automobiles. However, a key variable hurting Mexico is drug-related violence. Mexico’s ho-

                                            disadvantaged. As a percentage of GDP, Mexico’s oil-related activities have declined from 13 to
                                            7 from 2007 to 2017, so the country is far less dependent today on oil and gas.

                                       Chapter Summary
                                       The population of the world has surpassed 7 billion. Businesses more than ever before are now
                                       searching for new opportunities beyond their national boundaries. There has never been a more
                                       internationalized and economically competitive society than today’s. Some U.S. industries, such
                                       as textiles, steel, and consumer electronics, are in disarray as a result of the international chal-
                                       lenges of globalization.
                                            Success in business increasingly depends on offering products and services that are com-
                                       petitive on a world basis, not just on a local basis. If the price and quality of a firm’s products
                                       and services are not competitive with those available elsewhere in the world, the firm may soon
                                       face extinction. Global markets have become a reality in all but the most remote areas of the
                                       world. Certainly throughout the United States, even in small towns, firms feel the pressure of
                                       world competitors.
                                            This chapter has provided some basic global information that can be essential to consider in
                                       developing a strategic plan for any organization. Business culture and climate across countries
                                       are particularly important topics in strategic planning. The advantages of engaging in interna-
                                       tional business may well offset the drawbacks for most firms. It is important in strategic plan-
                                       ning to be effective, and the nature of global operations may be the key component in a plan’s
                                       overall effectiveness.

                                  A competitive climate exists among colleges and universities around the world. Colleges and univer-
                                  sities in Europe and Japan are increasingly recruiting U.S. students to offset declining enrollments.
                                  Foreign students already make up more than a third of the student body at many U.S. universities.
                                  The purpose of this exercise is to identify particular colleges and universities in foreign countries that
                                  recruit U.S. students.
                                  Instructions

                                                 and universities in that country. What programs are institutions in those countries recog-
                                                 nized for offering? What percentage of undergraduate and graduate students attending those
                                                 institutions are U.S. citizens? Do these institutions actively recruit U.S. students? Are any of
                                                 the schools of business at the various universities AACSB International accredited?
                                  Step 2         Prepare a report that summarizes your research findings. Present your report to the class.

                                  consider their travels to be helpful in becoming an effective businessperson? Generally speaking,
                                  the more one has traveled, especially outside one’s country, the more tolerant, understanding, and
                                  appreciative one is for diversity. Many students even state on their résumé the extent to which they

               Purpose
               Chapter 11 discusses potential advantages (and disadvantages) to initiating, continuing, or expanding
               international operations. Some important advantages are as follows:
                   1. Firms can gain new customers for their products.
                   2. Foreign operations can absorb excess capacity, reduce unit costs, and spread economic risks
                      over a wider number of markets.
                   3. Foreign operations can allow firms to establish low-cost production facilities in locations close
                      to raw materials or cheap labor.

                                   4. Competitors in foreign markets may not exist, or competition may be less intense than in do-
                                      mestic markets.
                                   5. Foreign operations may result in reduced tariffs, lower taxes, and favorable political
                                      treatment.
                                   6. Joint ventures can enable firms to learn the technology, culture, and business practices of other
                                      people and to make contacts with potential customers, suppliers, creditors, and distributors in
                                      foreign countries.
                                   7. Economies of scale can be achieved from global operations rather than solely domestic markets.
                                      Larger-scale production and better efficiencies allow higher-sales volumes and lower-price
                                      offerings.
                                   8. A firm’s power and prestige in domestic markets may be significantly enhanced if the firm com-
                                      petes globally. Enhanced prestige can translate into improved negotiating power among credi-
                                      tors, suppliers, distributors, and other important groups.
                                      The purpose of this exercise is to examine more closely eight potential advantages for a
                                  firm to initiate, continue, or expand international operations. In addition, the purpose of this
                                  exercise is to examine whether individual decision making is better than group decision making.
                                  Academic research suggests that groups make better decisions than individuals about 80 percent
                                  of the time.
                                  Instructions
                                  Rank the eight potential advantages for a firm to initiate, continue, or expand international opera-
                                  tions, as to their relative importance, where 1 = most important, to 8 = least important. First, rank the
                                  advantages as an individual. Then, rank the advantages as part of a group of three. Thus, determine
                                  what person(s) and what group(s) here today can come closest to the expert ranking. This exercise
                                  enables examination of the relative effectiveness of individual versus group decision making in stra-
                                  tegic planning.
                                  Steps
                                   1. Fill in Column 1 in Table 11-6 to reveal your individual ranking of the relative importance of
                                      the eight advantages (1 = most important, 2 = next most important, etc.). For example, if you
                                      think Advantage 1 (New Customers) is the second-most important advantage, then place a 2 in
                                      Table 1 in Column 1 by the first advantage listed (new customers).
                                   2. Fill in Column 2 in Table 11-6 to reveal your group’s ranking of the relative importance of the
                                      eight advantages (1 = most important, 2 = next most important, etc.).
                                   3. Fill in Column 3 in Table 11-6 to reveal the expert’s ranking of the eight advantages for a firm
                                      to initiate, continue, or expand international operations.
                                   4. Fill in Column 4 in Table 11-6 to reveal the absolute difference between Column 1 and Column
                                      3 to reveal how well you performed as an individual in this exercise. (Note: Absolute difference
                                      disregards negative numbers.)
                                   5. Fill in Column 5 in Table 11-6 to reveal the absolute difference between Column 2 and Column
                                      3 to reveal how well your group performed in this exercise.
                                   6. Sum Column 4. Sum Column 5.
                                   7. Compare the Column 4 sum with the Column 5 sum. If your Column 4 sum is less than your
                                      Column 5 sum, then you performed better as an individual than as a group. Normally, group
                                      decision making is superior to individual decision making, so if you did better than your group,
                                      you did excellent.
                                   8. The Individual Winner(s): The individual(s) with the lowest Column 4 sum is the
                                      WINNER.
                                   9. The Group Winners(s): The group(s) with the lowest Column 5 score is the WINNER.

               YOU MAY DRIVE A LYNK SOON




                                                                                                                                                       Maksim Toome/123RF
               In November 2017, a new Chinese firm, Lynk & Company, offered cars for the first time, 3,000 ve-
               hicles were sold online in 2 minutes. Lynk’s parent is Zhejiang Geely Holding Group headquartered
               in Hangzhou, China. The Lynk 01 is a gasoline-powered SUV that offers free wireless connectivity,
               voice-operated music streaming, and car-sharing services. After China, Lynk plans to market their ve-
               hicles across Europe and the United States. An all-electric version of the Lynk is coming soon. Geely
               automobile sales in China rose 63 percent in 2017 as “made in China” vehicles start to dominate the
               countryside there. Another large China automaker is SAIC Motor who sells the popular Roewe RX5.
               China’s top-selling SUV is a brand named Wey, manufactured by Great Wall Motors Company in
               China. Another Chinese firm, Zotye Auto, is building and selling electric cars in their country.
                    With U.S., German, and Korean firms doubling down on trying to manufacture and sell auto-
               mobiles in China, coupled with the national firms mentioned above tripling down on building home
               market share, China has become the most-contested region in the world for marketing vehicles. In
               China, Volvo just launched its Polestar premium electric car while Tesla is both producing and sell-
               ing electric cars there already. Although car sales in China grew only 1.4 percent in 2017, the slowest
               pace in 15 years, sales of electric cars in China in 2017 grew 72 percent to 578,000.
                    The automobile market in China is analogous in many respects to any region that offers a fast
               growth rate for certain products in any industry, in that numerous rival firms join the fray trying to be
               a first mover to the extent possible, rather than a late follower. All firms cannot win and a big shake-
               out is inevitable in China, but Lynk plans to gain economies of scale soon by rolling out its brand
               across the planet.

               Questions
                1. How important are economies of scale in the automobile industry for being successful in a coun-
                   try such as China?
                2. What are the competitive advantages and disadvantages of entering a market or country where
                   rivalry among firms (as Porter describes in Chapter 3) is so intense compared to targeting areas
                   that offer less growth and less rivalry?

      3. If you put on the x-axis rivalry of firms (low, medium, high) and on the y-axis potential growth in revenues (low, medium, high),
         draw a line for China and another line for the United States to reveal your thinking regarding the automobile industry tradeoffs that
         firms make in deciding where and why to focus money and resources. What do your lines represent or mean strategically?

                                  T
                                          he purpose of this section is to help you analyze strategic-management cases. Numerous
                                          guidelines and suggestions are presented as are steps to follow. Be sure to use the author
                                          website (www.strategyclub.com), which provides sample case analyses, sample presenta-
                                  tions, author videos, case and chapter updates, and especially the free Excel strategic planning
                                  template.
                                       A strategic-management case describes an organization’s external and internal conditions
                                  and raises issues concerning the firm’s vision, mission, strategies, objectives, and policies.
                                  Most of the information in a case is established fact, but some information may be opinions,
                                  judgments, and beliefs. Strategic-management cases are more comprehensive than those you
                                  may have studied in other courses. For example, a marketing case would focus on how some
                                  company does marketing. But a strategic-management case focuses on how a firm can generate
                                  a sustainable competitive advantage so it considers all the functional areas of business as well as
                                  external contingencies.
                                       A case puts you at the scene of the action by describing a firm’s situation at some point in
                                  time and asking you to recommend an effective path or plan forward. Strategic-management
                                  cases are written to give you practice applying strategic-management concepts. The case method
                                  for studying strategic management is learning by doing, meaning you will usually be asked to
                                  prepare a three-year strategic plan for a firm, just as if you were among top management of the
                                  firm or a consultant tasked with this work.


                                  Guidelines for Preparing to Discuss a Case in Class
                                  The case method of teaching can involve a classroom situation where your professor facilitates
                                  discussion by asking questions and encouraging student interaction regarding ideas, analyses,
                                  and recommendations. Be prepared for a discussion along the lines of “What would you do, why
                                  would you do it, when would you do it, and how would you do it?” Prepare answers to the fol-
                                  lowing types of questions:
                                   •   What are the firm’s most important external opportunities and threats?
                                   •   What are the organization’s major strengths and weaknesses?
                                   •   How would you describe the organization’s financial condition?
                                   •   What are the firm’s existing strategies and objectives?
                                   •   Who are the firm’s competitors, and what are their strategies?
                                   •   What objectives and strategies do you recommend for this organization? Explain your rea-
                                       soning. How does what you recommend compare to what the company plans?
                                   •   How could the organization best implement what you recommend? What implementation
                                       problems do you envision? How could the firm avoid or solve those problems?
                                   •   How is your firm unique to the competition? What products and services are different?
                                       Where along the value chain does your firm have uniqueness and a competitive ­advantage—
                                       and how will your proposed recommendations enhance the firm’s competitiveness?
                                   •   Are revised vision and mission statements needed given your strategic plan for the firm?
                                        Your professor may ask the whole class to prepare a case for class discussion. Preparing
                                  a case for class discussion means that you need to read the case before class, make notes
                                  ­regarding the organization’s external opportunities and threats as well as internal strengths
                                   and ­weaknesses, perform appropriate analyses, and come to class prepared to offer and defend
                                   some specific recommendations. Be excited about strategic management because in practice,
                                   the firm’s survival, and thus many people’s jobs, may depend on your decisions. Guidelines for
                                   participating in a case analysis class discussion are as follows:

                                  Be Practical
                                  There is no such thing as a complete case, and no case ever provides all the information needed
                                  for conducting analyses and making recommendations. Likewise, in the business world, strate-
                                  gists never have all the information they need to make decisions: Information may be unavail-
                                  able or too costly to obtain, or it may take too much time to obtain. So, in analyzing cases,
                                  do what strategists do every day, make reasonable assumptions about unknowns, perform




M12_DAVI1405_17_GE_P06.indd 378                                                                                                         19/04/22 1:02 AM
               ﻿How to Prepare and Present a Case Analysis    379


               appropriate analyses, and make decisions. Be practical. For example, in performing a projected
               financial analysis, make reasonable assumptions and proceed to show what impact your recom-
               mendations are expected to have on the organization’s financial position. Avoid saying, “I don’t
               have enough information.” Always supplement the information provided in a case with Internet
               and library research.

               Be Thorough
               There is no single best solution or one right answer to a strategic-management case, so it is im-
               portant to give ample justification for your recommendations. In the business world, strategists
               often do not know if their decisions are right until resources have been allocated and consumed.
               Then it is often too late to reverse a decision. Therefore, in your project, be thorough in justify-
               ing your thought process and recommendations, from the beginning to the end of your written or
               oral presentation.


               Be Realistic
               Avoid recommending a course of action beyond an organization’s means. Be realistic. No orga-
               nization can possibly pursue all the strategies that could potentially benefit the firm. Estimate
               how much capital will be required to implement your recommendation. Determine whether debt,
               stock, or a combination of debt and stock could be used to obtain the capital. Make sure your
               suggestions are feasible. Do not prepare a case analysis that omits all arguments and information
               not supportive of your recommendations. Rather, present the major advantages and disadvan-
               tages of several feasible alternatives. Try not to exaggerate, stereotype, prejudge, or overdrama-
               tize. Strive to demonstrate that your interpretation of the evidence is reasonable and objective.


               Be Specific
               Do not make broad generalizations such as, “The company should pursue a market penetration
               strategy.” Be specific by telling what, why, when, how, where, and who. Failure to use specifics is
               the single major shortcoming of most oral and written case analyses. Vagueness in stating factors
               and performing analyses is disastrous in strategic-management case analysis. For example, in an
               internal audit, say, “The firm’s current ratio fell from 2.2 in 2018 to 1.3 in 2019, and this is consid-
               ered to be a major weakness,” instead of “The firm’s financial condition is bad.” Recall that external
               and internal factors need to be “actionable, quantitative, comparative, and divisional (AQCD)” to
               the extent possible. Rather than concluding from a SPACE Matrix that a firm should be defensive,
               be more specific, saying, “The firm should consider closing three plants, laying off 280 employees,
               and divesting itself of its chemical division, for a net savings of $20.2 million in 2020.” Use ratios,
               percentages, numbers, and dollar estimates. Businesspeople dislike generalities and hate vagueness.


               Be Original
               Do not necessarily recommend the course of action that the firm plans to undertake. The aim
               of case analysis is for you to consider all the facts and information relevant to the organization
               at the time, to generate feasible alternative strategies, to choose among those alternatives, and
               to defend your recommendations. Support your position with charts, graphs, ratios, analyses,
               and the like. Be original. Compare and contrast what you recommend versus what the company
               plans to do or is doing.


               Listen and Contribute
               Strategy decisions are commonly made by a group of individuals rather than by a single person.
               Your professor will likely divide the class into three- or four-person teams and ask you to pre-
               pare written or oral case analyses. Members of a team, in class or in the business world, differ on
               their aversion to risk, their concern for short-run versus long-run benefits, their attitudes toward
               social responsibility, and their views concerning globalization. Be open-minded to others’ views.

                                  Developing and Delivering a Written Case Analysis
                                  Rather than have students analyze multiple cases during a semester, you may be asked to prepare
                                  a comprehensive written case analysis similar to the sample case analysis project provided at the
                                  author website at www.strategyclub.com. Or your professor could ask you or your team to focus
                                  the written case analysis on a particular aspect of the strategic-management process, such as (1)
                                  to identify and evaluate the organization’s existing vision, mission, objectives, and strategies; (2)
                                  to propose and defend specific recommendations for the company; or (3) to develop an industry
                                  analysis by describing the competitors, products, selling techniques, and market conditions in a
                                  given industry.
                                       In preparing a comprehensive case analysis, you could follow the table of contents
                                  (TOC) given in Table 1; sequence your analyses according to the TOC given. The TOC
                                  sequence matches the strategic-management process, stages, and chapters in this text. In
                                  your written project (strategic plan) file, provide a narrative after each analysis or matrix
                                  to reveal specific implications of that particular tool or technique for the focal firm. Avoid
                                  vagueness anywhere in project file. See the author comments in Table 1 for additional in-

                                  TABLE 1 A Sample Table of Contents (with author comments)
                                     1.   Introduction: Give a one-page overview of the firm.
                                     2.   Vision Statement: Present the firm’s vision statement versus your proposed statement.
                                     3.   Mission Statement: Present the firm’s mission statement versus your proposed statement.
                                     4.   EFE Matrix: Include 10 external opportunities and ten external threats.
                                     5.   CPM: Include the firm and two rival firms compared across 10 to 20 key variables (the template
                                          allows inclusion of 12 factors).
                                     6.   Most Recent Income Statement and Balance Sheets: Provide here to enable ratio analysis to come
                                          next (Note: Convert actual Form10K statements to the template-formatted statements to enable
                                          financial ratio analyses and development of projected financial statements later in project).
                                     7.   Financial Ratio Analysis: Show template-calculated and/or Internet-derived ratios and comment on
                                          key ones; do not give definitions of the ratios and do not highlight all the ratios.
                                     8.   IFE Matrix: Include 10 strengths and 10 weaknesses.
                                     9.   SWOT Analysis: Include four SO, WO, ST, WT strategies (16 total) and make sure the strategies
                                          are specific so you can reasonably estimate a cost (dollar value) for any strategy that makes it to
                                          recommendations page.
                                    10.   BCG: Prepare two BCG matrices, one by geographic area and the other by product, if possible;
                                          focus more on the implications than the numbers or mechanics of the matrix; strategies must be
                                          specific; avoid vague terms such as market penetration.
                                    11.   IE Matrix: Prepare two IE matrices, one by geographic area and the other by product, if possible;
                                          focus more on the implications than the numbers. For example, state how a division located in
                                          the hold and maintain quadrant will move to the grow and build quadrant after your strategies are
                                          implemented. This approach is more effective than simply stating the division is located in the row
                                          and build quadrant. Slowly introduce your recommendations during your written project or oral
                                          presentation – to facilitate the audience following your thought process throughout. If you attempt
                                          to “save” your recommendations to the end as a surprise, you risk losing the audience.
                                    12.   SPACE Matrix: Prepare a detailed analysis for the focal firm; also show plots for two rival firms;
                                          focus more on the implications than the numbers. For example, describe how your firm will move
                                          within the SPACE graph/matrix after your recommendations are implemented. Comment specifi-
                                          cally on a few axis variables and how your actions will improve them and thus the position of
                                          the firm in the SPACE. As with any matrix, do not teach the mechanics of the matrix during your
                                          presentation.
                                    13.   Grand Strategy Matrix: Include the focal firm and two rival firms in your matrix.
                                    14.   QSPM: Select the two most attractive SWOT strategies to include along the top row of your
                                          QSPM.

                 15. Perceptual Maps: Include two maps, be creative as per the dimensions; frame your discussion in
                     terms of competitive advantage of focal firm versus rivals as per your proposed strategic plan.
                     Discuss market space that is not yet used by rivals and the benefits or drawbacks of serving this
                     market space. Comment on how rival firms are repositioning versus how you plan the focal firm to
                     reposition given your recommendations.
                 16. Organizational Structure: Include (1) the existing chart developed based on executive titles, and
                     (2) your proposed chart based on the guidelines provided in Chapter 7.
                 17. Corporate Valuations: Include (1) focal firm, (2) rival firm, and (3) potential firm to be
                     acquired.
                 18. Recommendations: Include at least 10 with costs for each given and summed; divide your
                     ­strategies (1) existing strategies to be continued and (2) new strategies to be started.
                 19. EPS/EBIT Analysis: Include (1) all stock, (2) all debt, and (3) some combination of stock and
                      debt.
                 20. Projected Financial Statements: Provide 3 years to show expected impact of your
                      recommendations.
                 21. Projected Financial Ratios: Show template-calculated ratios and comment on key ones.
                 22. Retained Earnings Table: Make sure far right column of table matches the retained earnings row
                      on your projected balance sheets (see Chapter 8).
                 23. Executive Summary: Give a one-page overview of your strategic plan for the firm.




               Making an Oral Presentation
               Your professor may ask you to present your analysis to the class. Oral presentations are usually
               graded on two parts: content and delivery. Content refers to the quality, quantity, correctness,
               and appropriateness of analyses presented, including such dimensions as logical flow through
               the presentation, coverage of major issues, use of specifics, avoidance of generalities, absence
               of mistakes, and feasibility of recommendations. Delivery includes such dimensions as audi-
               ence attentiveness, clarity of visual aids, appropriate dress, persuasiveness of arguments, tone
               of voice, eye contact, and posture. Great ideas are of no value unless others can be convinced of
               their merit through clear communication.
                    The guidelines presented here can help you make an effective oral presentation. Present a
               united front when presenting as a team. Always say “we did” and “we recommend,” rather than,
               “I did the financial ratios” or “I recommend boosting advertising by 30 percent.” A light or hu-
               morous introduction can be effective at the beginning of a presentation.


               Controlling Your Voice
               An effective rate of speaking ranges from 100 to 125 words per minute. Practice your presenta-
               tion aloud to determine if you are talking too fast. Individuals commonly speak too fast when
               they are nervous. Breathe deeply before and during the presentation to help yourself slow down.
               Have a cup of water available; pausing to take a drink will wet your throat, take your time to
               collect your thoughts, control your nervousness, slow you down, and signal to the audience a
               change in topic.
                    Avoid a monotone voice by placing emphasis on different words or sentences. Speak loudly
               and clearly, but do not shout. Silence can be used effectively to break a monotone voice. Stop at
               the end of each sentence, rather than running sentences together with and or uh.


               Managing Body Language
               Be sure not to fold your arms, lean on the podium, put your hands in your pockets, or put your
               hands behind you. Maintain a straight posture, with one foot slightly in front of the other. Above
               all, do not turn your back to the audience; doing so is not only rude but it also prevents your
               voice from projecting well. Avoid using too many hand gestures, too. On occasion, leave the
               podium or table and walk toward your audience, but do not walk around too much. Never block
               the audience’s view of your visual aids.

    382    PART 6 • STRATEGIC-MANAGEMENT CASE ANALYSIS

                                       Maintain good eye contact throughout the presentation. This is the best way to persuade
                                  your audience. There is nothing more reassuring to a speaker than to see members of the audi-
                                  ence nod in agreement or smile. Try to look everyone in the eye at least once during your presen-
                                  tation, but focus more on individuals who look interested than on those who seem bored. To stay
                                  in touch with your audience, use humor and smiles as appropriate throughout your presentation.
                                  No presentation should ever be dull!

                                  Speaking from Slides
                                  Be sure not to read to your audience; reading puts people to sleep, and to be quite honest, read-
                                  ing to an audience is demeaning. Know your project well enough to present your project from a
                                  dozen or so PowerPoint slides. Generally, there should be no more than four to six lines of text
                                  on each slide. Use clear headings and subheadings. Do not use many handouts or your audience
                                  may concentrate on them instead of you during the presentation. Do not read from notecards.

                                  Answering Questions
                                  It is best to field questions at the end of your presentation, rather than during the presentation
                                  itself. Do not abruptly exit the stage or delete your last PowerPoint slide when you finish speak-
                                  ing; genuinely seek to answer questions. Encourage questions, and take your time to respond
                                  to each one. Answering questions can be persuasive because it involves you with the audience.
                                  During the question-and-answer period, be polite, confident, and courteous. Avoid verbose re-
                                  sponses. Do not get defensive with your answers, even if a hostile or confrontational question
                                  is asked. Staying calm during potentially disruptive situations such as a calculation mistake, re-
                                  flects self-confidence, maturity, poise, and command of the particular company and its industry.

                                  Presenting a Case Analysis Orally
                                  Your professor may allow between 10 and 30 minutes for your case presentation. Be sure in an
                                  oral presentation to manage time, knowing that your recommendations and associated costs are
                                  the most important part. Your project file should be a .docx, but if giving a presentation also,
                                  develop a dozen or more PowerPoint slides to anchor your presentation.
                                       On the strategyclub.com website, a breakdown is given for a 10- and a 15-minute oral case
                                  presentation. Once at the www.strategyclub.com website, simply click on Student Resources and
                                  then download the files needed. Whatever amount of time is allowed, use time effectively, so
                                  practice before actual delivery.


                                  Tips for Success in Case Analysis
                                  Strategic-management students who have used this text over 16 editions offer you the following
                                  22 tips for success in doing case analysis. The tips are provided in Table 2.

                                          Management Case Analysis
                                      1. Use the www.strategyclub.com website resources. The free Excel student template is especially
                                         useful as are the sample PowerPoint case analyses.
                                      2. In preparing your external assessment, use the online databases subscribed to by your college
                                         library as identified in Chapters 3 and 4.
                                      3. View your case analysis and presentation as a product that must have some competitive factor to
                                         favorably differentiate it from the case analyses of other students, such as wear clothes of the fo-
                                         cal firm or show a compelling 30-second video.
                                      4. Seek the help of professors in other specialty areas when necessary, and mention them by name
                                         in your presentation.
                                      5. A goal of case analysis is to improve your ability to think clearly in uncertain situations; do not
                                         get frustrated that there is no single best answer.

                    6. Develop confidence in using quantitative tools for analysis. Being a business major, never shy
                       away from quantitative analyses. Exude self-confidence when speaking.
                    7. Strive for excellence in writing. Avoid typos and sloppiness. Neatness is important.
                    8. Pay attention to detail. Be meticulous. Employers want careful, meticulous employees.
                    9. Do not merely recite ratios or present figures. Rather, develop ideas and conclusions concerning
                       the possible trends. Use figures to support what your team is recommending.
                   10. Emphasize the Recommendations and Strategy Implementation sections. A common mistake is
                       to spend too much time on the external or internal analysis parts of your paper or presentation.
                       The recommendations and implementation sections are the most important parts.
                   11. Throughout your case analysis, emphasize how your proposed strategic plan will enable the firm
                       to gain and sustain competitive advantage.
                   12. When working as a team, do most of the work individually. Use team meetings mostly to assimi-
                       late work. This approach is most efficient.
                   13. During the presentation, keep good posture, eye contact, and voice tone, and project confidence.
                       Do not get defensive under any conditions or with any questions. Ask the audience to point out
                       any mistakes seen or any work that is unclear.
                   14. Capitalize on the strengths of each member of the group; volunteer your services in your areas of
                       strength.
                   15. Think of your case analysis as if it were really doing this for a company. For example, do not
                       invest much time describing what the firm has been doing; spend considerable time describing

               Honda Motor Co., Ltd.—2022

               global.honda
               Headquartered in Tokyo, Japan, Honda Motor Co., Ltd. is a multinational manufacturer of au-
               tomobiles, motorcycles, marine engines, personal watercraft, lawn mowers, generators, power
               tools, and even aircraft engines. Honda is organized into four major divisions: Motorcycle
               Business, Automotive Business, Financial Services Business, and Life Creations and Other
               Businesses. Within the Life Creation and Other Businesses division lies Engine Manufacturing
               and Powersports Manufacturing. Honda currently employs over 200,000 associates worldwide
               and is a respected top competitor globally. Major rival companies include Toyota, Suzuki, Ford
               Motor Company, General Motors, Volkswagen, BMW, Harley-Davidson, and Polaris Industries.
                    Honda has assembly plants globally, including in Argentina, Belgium, Brazil, Canada,
               China, India, Indonesia, Japan, Pakistan, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Peru, Philippines,
               Taiwan, Thailand, Turkey, the United Kingdom, the United States, and Vietnam. Honda
               Canada is headquartered in Markham, Ontario, and in Alliston, Ontario. In India, Honda
               has the joint ventures Honda Siel Cars and Hero Honda Motorcycles. In China, Honda owns
               Guangzhou Honda and Dongfeng Honda. In Malaysia and Pakistan, Honda owns Boon Siew
               Honda and Honda Atlas, respectively. The American Honda Motor Company is based in
               Torrance, California.
                    Honda receives the majority of its annual sales from automobiles, a market the firm entered
               in 1963, but the firm is also the world leader in producing motorcycles. Well-known Honda ve-
               hicles include its lightweight, fuel-efficient passenger cars such as the popular Civic and Accord
               models and its luxury car, Acura. Honda is a major Japanese exporter to the United States and to
               other parts of the world. In total, Honda serves 25 million customers the world over.
                    In 2021, Honda recommitted to producing clean vehicles and machines and stated that de-
               carbonization is an important “mission” of the company and that they aimed to achieve carbon
               neutrality by 2050. Honda says that its new electric vehicle, introduced into Europe and Japan in
               2020, is only the first step of this process, and the company has worked for years to use renew-
               able energy and recycle as often as possible.
                    In addition to environmental friendliness, Honda is also striving for zero traffic fatalities
               with Honda products by 2050. The firm is counting on their Honda SENSING technology and
               features, which qualify as Level 3 automated-driving equipment.
                    Though focused on transportation and power tools, Honda can be said to have a related diver-
               sification strategy. However, sales have decreased in all business categories, based on figures at
               the end of Honda’s fiscal year, which at the time of writing is March 21, 2021. The firm needs a
               strong strategic plan moving forward, especially centered around what products to continue sell-
               ing and which geographic and demographic markets to focus resources on.

               History
               Honda Motor Company’s founder, Honda Soichiro, worked in the 1930s as a mechanic at the Art
               Shokai garage, fine-tuning cars that he would later enter in race competitions. He later founded
               Tōkai Seiki (Eastern Sea Precision Machine Company) to make piston rings for Toyota in sup-
               port of the war effort. After attending engineering school (but not graduating), he visited facto-
               ries around Japan to better understand Toyota’s quality control processes, known as “Five Ways.”
                   To address the demand for efficient small internal combustion engines, he founded the
               Honda Technical Research Institute in 1946, which was incorporated as Honda Motor Company
               only two years later. It started producing motorcycles in 1949, and by 1953, the C-100, a small-
               engine motorcycle, was available for purchase. It quickly gained popularity and made Honda the
               world’s largest motorcycle company by 1959. In another innovation, Honda introduced its dual-
               clutch transmission in motorcycles in 2010.
                   In 1959, Honda established the American Honda Motor Company, a U.S. subsidiary, which
               began producing motorcycles in the United States in 1979 and automobiles in 1982.

    386    STRATEGIC-MANAGEMENT CASE ANALYSIS

                                                    Honda has remained the world’s largest motorcycle manufacturer since 1959, and today it
                                                has a production level of over 400 million units annually. Honda is also the world’s largest manu-
                                                facturer of internal combustion engines measured by volume, producing more than 14 million
                                                units each year. Honda is the second-largest Japanese automobile manufacturer, behind Toyota,
                                                and was the first Japanese automobile manufacturer to release a dedicated luxury brand, Acura,
                                                in 1986. In 1987, it became America’s best-selling import luxury vehicle with its Integra and
                                                Legend product lines.

                                                Vision/Mission
                                                Honda has two fundamental beliefs: “Respect for the Individual,” and “The Three Joys,” which
                                                are the joy of buying, the joy of selling, and the joy of creating. “Respect for the Individual” repre-
                                                sents a philosophy of nurturing and promoting admirable characteristics throughout the company
                                                by respecting individual differences and trusting one an other as equal partners. “The Three Joys”
                                                are based on “Respect for the Individual” as the company strives to “create joy together” at all
                                                Honda worksites, with the ultimate goal of creating joy among its customers as the driving force.
                                                    Honda’s vision for 2030 is to help its customers worldwide to grow their “life’s potential.”
                                                By doing so, Honda fulfills its mission statement, which affirms its commitment to customer
                                                satisfaction through high-quality products at reasonable prices, all through a global perspec-
                                                tive. The mission statement can be viewed in the “Philosophy” section of the company website:
                                                honda-rd.asia.
                                                    Honda is known globally for excellent quality products at a competitive price point. The
                                                company’s commitment to affordable quality is the distinct competitive advantage it uses to
                                                remain among the top competitors in the industry.

                                                Internal Issues
                                                Organizational Structure
                                                Honda has 81 Japanese subsidiaries and 267 overseas subsidiaries. Pages 33 and 34 in the com-

                                                Honda’s current CEO is also President of the company. The current organizational chart does not

               Production/Operations
               With several hundred factories around the world, Honda produces many of the major compo-
               nents of its products to ensure quality control. These components include engines, frames, and
               transmissions. Smaller components such as shock absorbers, electrical equipment, and tires are
               outsourced. Other raw materials including paint, steel plates, steel tubes, plastic, and zinc are
               also purchased from outside suppliers. Among these raw materials, the most important is steel
               plates, accounting for approximately 36 percent of Honda’s total purchases of raw materials.

               Financial Data and Statements
               Honda’s revenue for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2021, decreased by ¥1.76 trillion, or 12
               percent, to ¥13.17 trillion from the prior fiscal year. The company’s operating profit increased
               by ¥26.5 billion, or 4.2 percent, to ¥660.2 billion from the previous fiscal year. However, the
               company’s profit before income taxes rose by ¥124.1 billion, or 15.7 percent, to ¥914.0 billion
               compared to the previous fiscal year. Profit for the year increased from the previous fiscal year

                                   By-Product Segment Information
                                   The Motorcycle Division
                                   Honda’s unit sales of motorcycles, all-terrain vehicles (ATVs), and side-by-sides (SxS) in fiscal
                                   2021 totaled 10.264 million units, down 17.4 percent from the previous fiscal year. About 88
                                   percent of Honda’s motorcycle units on a group basis were sold in Asia. Honda produces a wide
                                   range of motorcycles, with engine displacements ranging from the 50cc class to the 1800cc class
                                   in 1-, 2-, 4-, or 6-cylinder configurations. Honda also has electric vehicles in its lineup as well as
                                   motorcycle racing, sports, business, and commuter models.
                                        Honda’s motorcycle revenues decreased from the previous fiscal year by ¥272.0 billion in
                                   fiscal 2021, or 13.2 percent, to ¥1.787 trillion. Most other major lines on the income statement
                                   for motorcycles also decreased in fiscal 2021, including research and development (R&D) ex-
                                   penses, which decreased 16.5 percent, and operating profit, which decreased 21.4 percent from
                                   the previous fiscal year.
                                        From a by-region perspective, Honda’s motorcycle sales in Japan for fiscal 2021 was
                                   370,000 units, an increase of 4 percent from the previous fiscal year. However, Honda’s unit
                                   sales in North America only increased 0.6 percent in fiscal 2021 from the previous fiscal year
                                   to 332,000 units. Honda’s unit motorcycle sales in Europe decreased 2.1 percent in fiscal 2021
                                   from the previous fiscal year to 234,000 units, mainly due to decreases in sales units of the
                                   CB500 model series. Honda’s motorcycle sales decreased by over 18 percent in fiscal 2021,
                                   attributed predominantly to a decrease in sales in India of the Activa model and the Air Blade
                                   model in Vietnam. These numbers do not include sales by P.T. Astra Honda Motor in Indonesia,
                                   which reported that unit sales for fiscal 2021 decreased a whopping 45 percent from the pre-
                                   vious fiscal year to 2.69 million units, mainly due to decreases in sales units of the BeAT
                                   and Vario model series. In Honda’s Other Regions (including South America, the Middle East,
                                   Africa, Oceania, and other markets), unit sales in fiscal 2021 decreased 20.9 percent from the
                                   previous fiscal year to 1.03 million units, due mainly to decreases in sales units of the CG160
                                   and Biz model series in Brazil.
                                        In 2010, Honda engineers introduced the dual-clutch transmission, which gives riders
                                   the sensation of a manual drive along with the convenience of an automatic drive without the
                                   clutch. More recently, Honda engineers have integrated smartphone apps in new motorcycles.
                                   Riders can now enjoy navigation, text, music, and even phone calls in a safe, hands-free journey

               that does not take the focus off the road. Honda considers this technology especially important
               for the Indian and Thai markets, where people use motorcycles more than in other regions and
               also, at least according to Honda, talk to their family more on the phone than people living in
               other countries do.
                   Honda engineers also are increasingly designing braking systems based on the type of riding
               the motorcycle is designed for. Traditionally, bikes came with single-type antilock brakes (ABS),
               which had a tendency to cause falls off the bike. Now bikes are designed with dual-type ABS,
               super sport-type ABS (used for breaking while cornering in circuit riding), and even off-road
               ABS systems.

               The Automobile Division
               Honda began automobile operations in 1963 and quickly grew into a dominant player in the
               world automobile market. In 1982, Honda became the first Japanese automaker to produce ve-
               hicles in the United States with the popular Honda Accord, leading to the establishment of the
               Acura Brand in 1986.
                   Honda’s unit sales of automobiles in fiscal 2021 totaled 2.6 million units, down 21.1 percent
               from the previous fiscal year and down in all regions. About 49 percent of Honda’s automobile
               units (including sales under the Acura brand) were sold in Asia, followed by 33 percent in North
               America and 13 percent in Japan. Honda’s vehicles use gasoline engines of 3-, 4-, or 6-cylinder
               configurations; diesel engines; gasoline-electric hybrid systems; and gasoline-electric plug-in
               hybrid systems, as well as alternative fuel-powered vehicles such as battery electric vehicles,
               fuel cell vehicles, and flexible fuel vehicles. Honda’s principal automobile products include the
               Accord, City, Civic, Crider, Fit/Jazz, Breeze, CR-V, Freed, Odyssey, Pilot, Vezel/HR-V, XR-V,
               and N-Box.
                   Honda’s automobile division sales revenue for fiscal 2021 decreased by ¥1.39 trillion, or 14
               percent, to ¥8.56 trillion from the previous fiscal year. Selling, general and administrative ex-
               penses, and research and development expenses also decreased in this division. The company’s
               automobile operating profit decreased from the previous fiscal year by ¥63 billion, or 41.1 per-
               cent, during fiscal 2021 to ¥90.2 billion. In Japan and the United States, which are the two main
               sales markets for Honda automobiles, the contribution margin of light truck unit sales was about
               25 percent higher than Honda’s passenger cars category.
                   Honda experienced sharp declines in many popular automobile sales in fiscal 2021 across
               many of its most profitable regions. In Japan, for example, unit automobile sales decreased nearly
               12 percent, attributed mostly to reduced sales of the N-box model series. In North America,
               sales were down 19 percent due to sharp declines in sales of both the Accord and Civic. Many
               of the sales reductions were from manufacturing fewer automobiles. In Europe, Honda’s auto-
               mobile sales were down 24 percent over the same period, Asia sales were down 31 percent, and
               China sales were down 34 percent.
                   Honda management talks often about their strategy to become near-zero emissions by
               2050 and to reduce traffic deaths to zero by 2050. To help move the firm toward the former
               commitment, Honda has increased its R&D of hydrogen stations instead of relying on outside
               firms to develop this technology. Honda hopes its R&D in this area will soon produce vehicles
               that will run on hydrogen, often called fuel cell vehicles (FCVs). To fulfill their commitment
               to safer roads, Honda’s global safety concept of “Safety for Everyone” is designed to make the
               roads safer not just for operators of vehicles and motorcycles but also for pedestrians. When
               fully developed, the technology can detect pedestrians, reduce blind spots, aid drivers in stay-
               ing in the lane, notify drivers if they are not focusing on the road, and support drivers in many
               other ways.

               The Financial Services Segment
               Financial services provided by Honda include retail lending, leasing to customers, and wholesale
               financing to dealers. Honda offers a variety of financial services to customers and dealers in
               many countries to provide sales support for products.
                   Honda’s sales revenue from its Financial Services division decreased by ¥92.6 billion, or 3.6
               percent, to ¥2.49 trillion in fiscal 2021, due mainly to lower revenues from leased vehicles. This
               decline enabled operating profits to increase in fiscal 2021 by ¥137.2 billion, or 62.5 percent, to
               ¥356.9 billion.

                                   The Life Creation and Other Division
                                   In 2019, Honda changed the name of its Power Product segment to Life Creation and Other in
                                   order to signify the company’s intent for this segment to create new value for “mobility” and
                                   “daily lives,” which includes improving existing power products and starting new businesses
                                   for the future, including energy products. In this division, Honda manufactures power products
                                   such as general-purpose engines, generators, water pumps, lawn mowers, riding mowers, robotic
                                   mowers, brush cutters, tillers, snow blowers, outboard marine engines, walking assist devices,
                                   and portable battery inverter power sources. Energy products are to consist of portable and swap-
                                   pable batteries rechargeable with renewable energy, but this also includes energy management
                                   services for electric vehicle owners to charge their car with renewables.
                                       Regarding the “Other” businesses, Honda began deliveries of the HondaJet aircraft in
                                   December 2015. For fiscal 2021, about 47 percent of Honda’s power products units were sold
                                   in North America, followed by 25 percent in Asia, and 17 percent in Europe. Sales in power
                                   products were down 1.4 percent in 2021, mostly from decreased sales in North America; sales in
                                   Europe and Asia, on the other hand, increased slightly.
                                       Exhibit 4 provides a breakdown of Honda’s revenues by product category. Note the signifi-
                                   cant decreases across all segment categories.

                                   Honda’s unit sales of all products in Japan in 2021 increased 7.7 percent from the previous fiscal
                                   year to about 336,000 units, mainly due to the increases in sales of generators and original equip-

                                   party. In Japan, Honda’s sales revenue from domestic and export sales decreased in 2021 by ¥555
                                   billion, or 12.6 percent, from the previous fiscal year to ¥3.86 trillion, due mainly to decreased
                                   sales revenue in the Automobile business.

                                   North America
                                   Honda’s unit sales of all products in North America, where the United States is the principal mar-
                                   ket, were down 8.1 percent in 2021 from the previous fiscal year to 2.6 million units, mainly due
                                   to the decrease in sales of OEM engines, which offset the increase, mainly in the sales of genera-
                                   tors. In North America, Honda’s sales revenue in 2021 decreased from the previous fiscal year
                                   by ¥1,075.9 billion, or 12.6 percent, to ¥7,480.8 billion, due mainly to decreased sales revenue
                                   in the Automobile business. Operating profit increased from the previous fiscal year by ¥150.5
                                   billion, or 49.3 percent, to ¥455.8 billion.

                                   Honda’s unit sales of all products in Europe increased 9.9 percent in 2021 from the previous
                                   fiscal year to about 929,000 units, mainly due to increased sales of lawnmowers and OEM en-
                                   gines, which offset the decrease in sales of generators. In Europe, Honda’s sales revenue in 2021
                                   decreased from the previous fiscal year by ¥90.7 billion, or 11.7 percent, to ¥681.8 billion, due
                                   mainly to decreased sales revenue in the Automobile business. Operating profit increased by
                                   ¥12.4 billion, or 83.1 percent, to ¥27.4 billion from the previous fiscal year.

               Asia

               year to 1.4 million units. This was also mainly due to the increased sales of OEM engines, which
               offset the decrease in sales of generators. In Asia, Honda’s sales revenue decreased by ¥400.9
               billion in fiscal 2021, or 10.4 percent, to ¥3,458.7 billion, while operating profit decreased by

               about 336,000 units, mainly due to increases in sales of OEM engines. In the Other Regions busi-

                                   mobile manufacturing company in the world, recently surpassing Volkswagen. In April 2021,
                                   Toyota purchased Lyft’s self-driving technology for $550 million and merged that operation with
                                   its own newly created Woven Planet automation division. Toyota designs and manufactures a
                                   diverse product line-up that ranges from subcompacts to luxury and sports vehicles to SUVs,
                                   trucks, minivans, and buses. Popular models include the Prius, Camry, Corolla, Land Cruiser,
                                   and Lexus lines, as well as the Tundra truck. Toyota’s subsidiaries also manufacture vehicles; for
                                   example, Daihatsu Motor produces mini-vehicles and Hino Motors produces trucks and buses.
                                   Toyota’s domestic sales account for about 45 percent of the company’s revenue.

               Headquartered in Detroit, Michigan, General Motors Corporation (GM) makes and sells cars
               and trucks worldwide under well-known brands such as Buick, Cadillac, Chevrolet, and GMC.
               General Motors Financial Co. provides financing services. GM is developing electric vehicles
               and autonomous vehicles and has established a ride-sharing service dubbed Maven. The United
               States accounts for about 80 percent of GM’s sales.

               External Factors
               Automakers globally face a rapidly changing external environment due, variously, to digitali-
               zation, connectivity, evolving powertrain technologies, tougher regulations, and shifts in con-
               sumer attitudes. These challenges are threats but also present opportunities. In pursuit of sales
               growth, global automakers are investing heavily in emerging markets by setting up local sub-
               sidiaries or joint ventures. Domestic manufacturers in emerging markets commonly reap tax
               benefits or other policies that give them an advantage over foreign competitors. Manufacturers
               in emerging markets are increasingly exporting their products to world markets. The global
               auto market declined nearly 14 percent in 2020 but is expected to rebound 13 percent in 2021.
               In 2020, 4 percent of new global auto sales were electric vehicles (EVs), but only 2 percent of
               new sales in the United States were electric vehicles. However, EVs are certainly the future, as
               demonstrated by Tesla’s sales of 500,000 EVs in 2020 and forecasts of 20 million EV units to
               be sold by 2030.
                   Honda continues to face difficulties globally due to the spread of COVID-19 and the impact
               of a semiconductor supply shortage. In the United States, the government’s economic stimulus
               measures were minimally effective. In Europe, economic activity remains restrained, while in
               Asia the economies have slowed in India, Thailand, Japan, and Indonesia. China, however, has
               experienced a moderate economic recovery mainly due to government stimulus measures.
                   A multitude of economic factors have affected Honda. In addition to COVID-19 concerns
               and economic distress, populations are aging, urbanization is accelerating, climate change is
               worsening, and industry structures are changing due to progress in technologies such as the use
               of electric-powered motors, autonomous driving, and IoT, all on a global scale.
                   Within the motorcycle business, competition with emerging manufacturers is intensifying.
               Data suggests that highway motorcycles account for 54 percent of the U.S. motorcycle market
               share, followed by off-highway motorcycles at 19 percent share. Dual motorcycles accounted for
               9 percent of revenue in 2020, with scooters at 4 percent. Bicycles and parts filled the balance of
               Honda’s 2020 revenue.
                   Honda has set a CO2 reduction target rate that far exceeds the governmental targets for
               emerging markets. The company aims to become an environmental leader in motorcycles, not
               only through the use of electric-powered motors, but also through improved fuel efficiency and
               the use of biofuels.
                   With regard to electrification in the Automobile business, Honda plans to achieve carbon
               neutrality in accordance with the needs of each country it operates in. The company is striving to
               effectively respond to electrification, driver-assistive technologies, connected technologies, and
               other technological innovations. Honda needs to develop products and services equipped with
               such next-generation technologies across all its product-based and region-based segments. For
               example, Honda likely needs to further expand its lineup of EVs and FCVs based on electric-
               powered motor technology. Honda is currently developing its own all-solid-state batteries.
                   Vehicle sales across all regions have been flat since 2015. Global sales of vehicles were
               90 million in 2015, increasing only to 95 million by 2018 before falling back to 90 million in
               2019 and falling again to 78 million in Covid-impacted 2020. The United States and Europe
               each account for about 22 percent of the global market share; China, 32 percent; Japan, 6 per-
               cent; and South America, 4 percent; with other regions making up the balance. Annual growth
               in the United States is forecasted to be 1 percent from 2021 through 2024, with a 2 percent
               growth forecasted in the United States on SUV and light trucks. Trucks in the United States
               tend to sell for a premium and hold their value, making new trucks an attractive product for auto
               manufacturers.

                                   Conclusion
                                   With the automotive industry spiraling rapidly toward new innovations and electric vehicles,
                                   Honda should perhaps accelerate its electric automotive product development efforts. Due to the
                                   increases in minimum wage expected soon around the world, Honda may need to invest more
                                   in automotive assembly automation. This is important because the Automotive Division gener-
                                   ates the most profits for Honda, and profits will be severely decreased by the mandatory wage
                                   increases. Automation also creates the potential for more production output due to less downtime
                                   required for automated processes.
                                       Honda’s Life and Creation Division is experiencing higher demand than Honda’s current
                                   production capabilities, so capacity needs to increase. The powersports industry has become
                                   highly competitive, so additional expenditures in R&D are also likely needed for this division.
                                       The second largest income-producing division for Honda is the Motorcycle Division. As
                                   most of the revenue for this division is generated in the Asia-Pacific region, Honda should per-
                                   haps increase motorcycle exports over the next 5 years to benefit from rising global demand for
                                   motorcycles. More exports would necessitate increased motorcycle production capabilities.
                                       Honda needs additional marketing to get the message out globally to inform potential cus-
                                   tomers of its upcoming hi-tech electronic products. A comprehensive strategic plan is needed at
                                   Honda to guide its decision making in the future.

               History
               In 1969, Doris and Don Fisher entered the clothing retail business with the vision of creating a
               unique shopping experience that offered a wide selection of styles. The idea behind the first Gap
               store, founded in San Francisco, was to provide fresh, casual, American style clothes. By 1970,
               sales reached $2 million and the company opened its second store in San Jose, California. Six
               years later, in 1976, the company underwent major changes and initiated its first public offering
               of 1.2 million shares of stock on the New York and Pacific Stock Exchange.
                    The 1980s was a period of major growth and expansion. In 1980, Gap dropped Levis and
               other brands and began focusing on its own private label. In 1983, Gap expanded horizontally by
               acquiring Banana Republic, as well as expanding its product line and introducing GapKids with
               the opening of its first store in San Mateo, California. A year later, Gap burst into the interna-
               tional market and established its presence in London, England, and Vancouver, British Colombia.
               The same year, Gap entered the European market and Gap’s annual sales reached $1 billion.
                    In 2005, Gap revamped its online stores by offering more convenience and interactive shop-
               ping. The following year, Gap added PiperLime to its online brands. In 2008, the company acquired
               Athleta Inc., a women’s sports and active apparel company based in Petaluma, California, for $148
               million. Gap opened its first stores in Serbia and Ukraine in 2011, broadening the clothing chain’s
               reach into Eastern Europe. Gap stores opened early 2018 in Belgrade and Kiev. Stephen Sunnucks,
               Gap’s international president, said in a statement that Ukraine is the fastest-growing retail market in
               Eastern Europe, while Serbia has many young customers who enjoy shopping.

               Vision/Mission
               Gap provides extensive literature and discussion on their corporate website regarding its efforts
               to enhance sustainability and take care of employees. Gap does not, however, report a written vi-
               sion or mission statement. However, from reviewing current and past Annual Reports, a possible
               mission could look something like the following:

                                            Gap’s sustainability strategy is aligned with the United Nations Global Sustainable Development
                                            Agenda that focuses on human rights, and the Paris Agreement that focuses on climate, and other
                                            sustainability programs. Gap is committed to ensuring its 135,000 employees and millions of peo-
                                            ple within its supply chain are paid fairly and work in safe conditions, as outlined in the company’s
                                            five focus areas on core sustainability. Also included among the five key areas are water steward-
                                            ship, product sustainability, and operational eco-efficiency. All areas are geared toward taking care
                                            of employees, and ensuring a small environmental footprint on all Gap products produced.

                                            Segment Data
                                            Gap primarily operates under Gap, Old Navy, Banana Republic, Athleta, and Intermix brands
                                            focusing primarily on clothing in all business segments. The company controls store layouts,
                                            marketing, brand development, and virtually all other vital factors for its full line of stores.
                                            Gap specializes in offering trendy but casual American style clothing focusing on denim,
                                            T-shirts, button-downs, khakis, and other casual styles of clothing and focusing on providing
                                            an affordable product though moderate price points. GapKids, GapBody, GapFit, babyGap,
                                            GapMaternity are common marketing names utilized by Gap. Customers can shop Gap at retail
                                            stores, outlet and factory stores, and on Gap’s website. Gap stores account for 41 percent of all
                                            The Gap Inc. stores.
                                                 The company provides revenues by both geographic region and by store brand on their
                                            Annual Report. Exhibit 2 reveals the number of store locations by geographic region and store
                                            brand. Note there are nearly 25 percent more Old Navy stores in North America than Gap stores,
                                            but only 2 percent of international stores are Old Navy with 88 percent of international stores
                                            being Gap. Also, around 12.5 percent of all company stores are franchised owned, primarily all

               outside of North America. Exhibit 3 reveals that over 83 percent of all Gap stores are located in
               North America. Exhibit 4 reveals that Gap, Old Navy, and Banana Republic account for 94 percent
               of all Gap Inc. stores worldwide.
                    Gap plans to open additional Old Navy stores in Mexico and China in the coming years, but
               closed all 53 Old Navy Stores in Japan in 2016. The company kept its presence in Japan with
               its 200 Gap and Banana Republic stores in that market. In total, the company closed 67 stores
               worldwide in 2016, revealing how important branding is among different nations; a one-size-
               fits-all approach does not apply; for example all but 13 of the 1,056 Old Navy stores are located
               in North America.
                    Athleta focuses on premium fitness and performance apparel focused on women and girls.
               The business focus is on yoga, sports, and everyday activities. The Gap Inc. acquired Intermix
               in 2012.
                    Exhibit 5 and Exhibit 6 reveal the company’s revenues and number of locations across re-
               gions and store type, respectively. Fiscal 2017 ended February 3, 2018. The U.S. region includes
               Puerto Rico and Guam. Fiscal 2017 results showed a substantial drop in company revenues in
               the United States, Canada, Europe, and Asia and across all brands, except slight increases in rev-
               enues from “Other Regions” and “Other Brands.”

               the company moving forward is whether the company should continue to add store locations in
               the United States, and if so, under which brand names? Historically, the family clothing business
               is bimodal in nature, with bargain stores such as TJX Companies and Ross Stores doing well
               during recessions and normal economic cycles and higher-end stores performing better during
               more prosperous economic times. How well is the company’s strategy aligned to take advantage
               of this bimodal situation? From the market bottom in 2002 to early 2018, the company’s stock
               price rose about 220 percent compared to 760 and 2,100 percent for TJX and Ross, respectively.
               Should Gap consider divesting possibly Banana Republic and adding a store similar to Ross or
               TJX as a product-development strategy?

               Production and Seasonality
               Gap purchases its products from approximately 800 venders in over 40 countries, with the largest
               two venders both providing around 5 percent of purchases annually. The majority of purchases
               are from factories outside the United States with around 50 percent of purchases coming equally
               from Vietnam and China. The company’s sales peak around the Christmas holiday period.

               Finance
               The company’s sales decreased about 2 percent in fiscal 2016 (year ending January 2017). The
               bulk of the decline was from reduced net sales at Gap and Banana Republic, with exchange rate
               losses only accounting for $20 million. However, more alarmingly, net income was down over
               26 percent over the same time period due mostly to a substantial increase in operating expenses.
               In fiscal 2015, total net sales declined $638 million. The company pays a $0.92 dividend and
               plans to re-initiate its $1 billion share repurchase plan in fiscal 2017 (year ending January 2018).
               Interesting use of the term “re-initiate” by The Gap Inc. as the firm listed $0 for treasury stock
               on its balance sheets, but did record treasury stock in fiscal 2014. The firm has $1.25 billion in
               long-term debt at a surprisingly high fixed rate of 5.95 percent through April 2021. From pur-
               chasing Athleta and Intermix in recent years, Gap Inc. reports a nominal amount of goodwill on
               the balance sheet.
                    The Gap’s income statements and balance sheets are provided in Exhibit 7 and Exhibit 8,
               respectively, for fiscal 2016 and 2017. For fiscal 2017 that ended February 3, 2018, The Gap
               Inc.’s revenues were $15.9 billion, up slightly from the prior year. The company ended fiscal
               2017 with 3,594 store locations; among these were 3,165 company-operated as opposed to
               being franchised.

               The TJX Companies (TJX)
               A treasure hunt in a department store? This is the experience that CEO Carol Meyrowitz of TJX
               wants customers to have when they come into any of the company’s more than 3,200 stores
               in United States, Canada, and Europe. TJX is a huge retail conglomerate of off-price brands,
               including T.J. Maxx, Marshalls, and HomeGoods—with stores in all 50 states in the United
               States, 10 provinces of Canada, United Kingdom, Ireland, Germany, Poland, and in Europe.
               Approximately 75 percent of revenues are derived from the United States and approximately 25
               percent of sales are derived from home goods. Headquartered in Framingham, Massachusetts,
               TJX’s revenue increased to $33 billion in fiscal 2016 that ended January 28, 2017 up from $31
               billion, while the company’s net income remained at $2.3 billion. Interestingly, net income
               for TJX has been stable with no real growth in the last 4 years. In 3,812 stores, TJX has about
               235,000 employees who often work “just a few doors down” from rival companies such as Ross
               Stores, Stein Mart, Gap, and Cato. TJX’s largest customer group are women; the firm has a fe-
               male CEO, the same as rival Gap Inc.

               Ross Stores (ROST)
               Based in Dublin, California, Ross Stores is a discount clothing and home fashions store offering
               products at prices generally 20 to 60 percent off typical retail department store prices. The firm’s
               main slogan is Ross, Dress for Less. The company operates under two segments, 1) Ross, Dress
               for Less and 2) dd’s Discounts, employs over 78,000, and reported revenues over $12.8 billion
               in fiscal year end January 2017. In total, Ross operates over 1,412 stores in 37 states with prod-
               uct offerings similar to TJX that include women’s clothing, lingerie, maternity clothing, shoes,
               accessories, handbags, watches, jewelry, luggage, and more. Ross operates under a no-frills

                                   advertising displays. The primary age groups for the store are 25 to 54 year olds. The company
                                   increased its store count by 87 stores in the most recent fiscal year, amounting to a 6 percent
                                   increase, which is in line with the increases in the last several years.

                                   Online
                                   Consumers are increasingly shopping online for clothing through auctions and online-only
                                   stores. Traditional retailers have virtually all responded with their own online websites, yet often
                                   at the same high prices found in their stores. Brick and mortar stores still hold the distinct advan-
                                   tage of customers being able to hold, feel, and try on items before purchasing, as well as talk to
                                   knowledgeable salespeople at higher quality stores.

                                   External Issues
                                   The family clothing business is very competitive as consumers increasingly have many options
                                   and many mediums to buy products. Many customers have been trained to wait for sales result-
                                   ing in lower inventory turnover times and reduced profit margins for retailers. Unlike many
                                   industries such as automobiles, electronics, or restaurants, the retail clothing business is highly
                                   seasonal in nature as styles, colors, and temperatures drastically affect stocking, allocating, and
                                   marketing various merchandise. Customer tastes can change quickly as well, with one year’s
                                   hot color or style of cut being less desired the next year. In the United States alone, family
                                   clothing stores account for over $100 billion in revenue, but yield profits less than $5 billion
                                   and a stagnate growth rate of around 1 percent. It is simply a tough business. Women’s clothing
                                   accounts for 52 percent of industry revenues; men and children account for 28 and 20 percent,
                                   respectively.

                                   Reshoring
                                   Over the last 50 years, production of apparel (textile industry) moved from the northern United
                                   States to the southern states, then to Mexico, and from there to places in Asia, such as China and
                                   Vietnam. However, there is a growing trend, according to the Boston Consulting Group, to pro-
                                   duce products domestically. Increasing transportation cost, government incentives, being closer
                                   to the end consumer, increasing labor cost abroad, recent changes to tax laws, and just simply
                                   being able to have “Made in the USA” on your product, is driving some firms to start production

               again in the United States. Several apparel firms who are now producing some of their brands in
               the U.S. include Abercrombie & Fitch, J. Crew, and Ralph Lauren’s Club Monaco brand. Even
               Nike, plagued by its operations in sweatshops in the past, is seriously considering reshoring
               select products.

               Expenses
               The family clothing store industry’s profit margin is less than 5 percent with purchases account-
               ing for 60 percent of all expenses, putting further pressure on finding cheap sources of clothing
               manufacturing. In 2017, over 80 percent of clothes sold in family clothing stores in the United
               States were imported from overseas. Also, contributing to the higher purchasing percentage is
               the price of cotton, which can vary wildly from year to year. Wages paid to store employees ac-
               count for just over 10 percent of industry revenues and there are constant pressures to increase
               wages. Rent and utilities account for 6 percent and advertising and marketing only account for 2
               percent of revenues.

               Clothing Materials Sustainability
               Many different materials are used to construct clothing. Cotton and linen are derived from
               plants, whereas wool, leather, and cashmere are derived from animals; today there are a slew of
               synthetic fibers such as polyester and spandex along with rayon, modal, and many others from
               wood. Cotton cultivation can leave a substantial economic footprint as pest and weed control
               measures, along with providing adequate water, are necessary to ensure growth. Two advantages
               to cotton are old clothing can be recycled and used again; Additionally, cotton is a renewable
               resource, or in other words, is able to be planted annually. Synthetic materials typically are
               nonrenewable—being derived from petroleum by products and have much longer biodegrad-
               able times than cotton. Cellulosic fibers from wood such as rayon and modal are often difficult
               to trace where the wood products were derived from, and at times, wood pulp is derived from
               endangered forests.

               Future
               In fiscal year 2018, The Gap Inc. plans to open about 25 additional company-operated stores,
               net of closures and repositions, with particular emphasis on opening new Athleta and Old Navy
               stores, with closing poorly performing Gap and Banana Republic stores. The company needs a
               clear strategic plan to best manage its thousands of brick-and-mortar stores in the face of rapidly
               increasing online preferences. The company hopes to maintain, or increase, its fiscal 2017 oper-
               ating margin of 9.3 percent—compared with 7.7 percent the prior year. The company’s products
               are available for purchase in more than 90 countries through company-owned, franchisee-
               owned, and e-commerce sites. Prepare an effective three year strategic plan for The Gap Inc.

                                   When it was founded in 1938 by Lee Byung-Chui in Ingyo-dong, Samsung was a trading com-
                                   pany with 40 employees, but in the decades since then, the company diversified into food pro-
                                   cessing, textiles, insurance, securities, and retail. However, the company’s big move was when
                                   Samsung entered the electronics business in the late 1960s by forming Samsung Electronics
                                   Devices, Samsung Electro-Mechanics, Samsung Corning, and Samsung Semiconductor &
                                   Telecommunications. Some of Samsung recent product launches include the following:
                                      2019—5G smartphone, Galaxy S10 5G
                                      2019—Exynos 980, 5G mobile processor
                                      2020—AI-technology-based Grande AI washer/dryer
                                      2020—World’s first ultra-high-speed DRAM for AI and next-generation super computers
                                      2020—Galaxy Z Flip, a foldable model with a new form factor
                                      2020—Operation of Pyeongtaek Line 2, the world’s largest semiconductor line


                                   Vision/Mission
                                   Vision Statement
                                   In 2019, Samsung announced its “Semiconductor Vision 2030,” a vision to invest KRW 133
                                   trillion up to 2030 in their system semiconductor business and to employ 15,000 persons. No
                                   other vision statement could be located for Samsung either on their corporate website or in the
                                   company’s Annual Report.

               Internal Issues
               Organizational Structure
               Samsung has its corporate headquarters and 29 consolidated subsidiaries in South Korea.
               Important Samsung locations include Suwon, Gumi, Gwangju, Giheung-gu, Hwaseong, and
               Pyeongtaek. Samsung has 212 overseas subsidiaries for product manufacturing, sales, and re-
               search and development (R&D), with locations in the United States, Europe/CIS, Middle East/
               Africa and Asia. Among these operations, Samsung has 55 subsidiaries in North America, in-
               cluding SEA (New Jersey, responsible for the sales of set products including TVs and HHPs),
               SII (California, manufacturing TVs), SAS (Texas, manufacturing semiconductor products), and
               Harman (Connecticut, automotive components).
                   In Europe and the Far East, Samsung has 75 subsidiaries, including SEUK (United
               Kingdom), SEG (Germany), SEF (France), and SEI (Italy) for sales of set products; SEH
               (Hungary) and SESK (Slovakia) for manufacturing TVs; and SEPM (Poland) for manufactur-
               ing home appliances such as refrigerators. The company has 19 subsidiaries in the Middle East
               and Africa for product manufacturing and sales. Additionally, the company has 30 subsidiar-
               ies in Asia-Pacific (excluding China), including SAPL (Singapore), SEAU (Australia), SEPCO
               (Philippines), and SME (Malaysia), which are responsible for regional sales. Samsung also op-
               erates numerous production sites including SIEL (India) for HHPs and other products, SEV and
               SEVT (Vietnam) for HHPs, SEHC (Vietnam) for TVs, and SDV (Vietnam) for DPs. Samsung
               operates 33 subsidiaries in China, including SCIC (Beijing) and SEHK (Hong Kong) for the
               sales of set products in those regions, and SSS (Shanghai) and SSCX (Xian) for semiconduc-
               tors and DP sales. Production sites include SSEC (Suzhou) for set products and SCS (Xian) for
               semiconductor production.
                   Samsung is organized utilizing a strategic business unit (SBU) design, the SBUs being the
               four divisions of the company. Under each division, there are many affiliates and subsidiaries. As
               indicated on pages 213–216 in Samsung’s 2020 Annual Report, the top 5 executives of Samsung
               are as follows:
                   1.   Ki-nam Kim		      CEO of DS Division
                   2.   Hyun-suk Kim      CEO of CE Division
                   3.   Dong-jin Koh      CEO of IM Division
                   4.   Jong-hee Han      Head of Visual Display (DP) Business
                   5. Jae-wan Bahk		      Chairman of the Board


               Financial Data and Statements
               Samsung’s revenues increased 3 percent in 2020, with a net income increase of 21 percent,
               making the firm one of the best performers in the world during that year. The global work-
               from-home corporate environment created a need for digital products, and people had time
               for home improvements as well. Industrywide, demand for many of these products declined
               in early 2020, but a massive demand for work-from-home products such as PCs and tablets
               emerged by the latter half of 2020. Exhibits 1 and 2 provide the latest income and balance
               sheets for Samsung.

               R&D Information
               Samsung’s R&D expenditures are large and growing; specifically, in millions of Korean won,
               these were KRW 18,662,029 in 2018, KRW 20,207,612 in 2019, and KRW 21,229,200 in
               2020. As a percentage of total sales, these R&D expenditures were 7.7, 8.8, and 9.0 in 2018,
               2019, and 2020, respectively. In 2020, Samsung invested KRW 21.2 trillion in R&D and reg-
               istered 6,648 domestic patents and 8,520 U.S. patents. In its home country of South Korea,
               Samsung operates three levels of R&D organizations: 1) a business unit development team
               under each division that focuses on short-term product enhancements, 2) a research institute
               under each business unit that develops mid- to long-term technology with a 3- to 5-year out-
               look, and 3) the Samsung Advanced Institute of Technology, which develops core long-term
               technology. (Pages 54–63 in Samsung’s 2020 Annual Report provide detailed information

               By-Segment Information
               As defined and described earlier, Samsung has four divisions: CE, IM, DS, and Harman. In 2020,
               the CE Division’s output of image devices was 48.2 million units produced at sites in Mexico,
               Vietnam, Brazil, and Hungary. The IM Division’s calendar 2020 output of HHPs was 249.2 mil-
               lion units, with major production sites in Korea (Gumi), Vietnam, India, and Brazil. In 2020, the
               DS Division’s memory output was 1.2 million units, produced at factories in Korea (Hwaseong
               and Pyeongtaek) and China. The DP Division’s output of display panels in 2020 was 5.9 million
               units, produced in Korea (Cheonan and Asan) and China. Lastly, the Harman Division’s digital
               cockpit output was 6.11 million units.
                   In 2020, Samsung’s CE and IM capacity utilization rates were calculated as actual output rel-
               ative to production capacity. The utilization rates were 93.6 percent for Image devices and 77.5
               percent for HHPs. The DS Division operates memory and display panel production 24 hours a
               day, in 3 shifts. Cumulative operating days, including holidays, were 366 days in 2020. The DS
               capacity utilization rate was calculated as actual hours (operating days × number of production
               lines × 24 hours) relative to production capacity. In 2020, Harman’s utilization rate was 65.3
               percent, calculated as actual output relative to production capacity. Be mindful that companies
               desire and strive for capacity utilization rates of 90 percent or above. This is analogous to com-
               mercial airplanes and tractor trailer trucks; you want those items working and in motion, not idle
               on runways or in parking lots.

    408    STRATEGIC-MANAGEMENT CASE ANALYSIS

                                   CE Segment
                                   The CE division has nine regional headquarters and has been the global market leader in the
                                   production of televisions for more than 15 years. Samsung continually produces new and
                                   improved TVs in, for example, their 8K QLED and ultra-large product range. Samsung’s
                                   global market share in the TV business has slowly increased from 29 percent in 2018, to
                                   30.9 percent in 2019, to 31.9 percent in 2020. In 2020, Samsung introduced their 4K and
                                   8K QLED TVs and new Lifestyle TVs such as The Premier and The Sero. In 2021, Samsung
                                   plans to enhance their product lineup by launching 80″–110″ Neo QLED TVs featuring
                                   significantly enhanced contrast and picture quality as well as MicroLED TVs for homes.
                                   Samsung first received global market share in this segment in 2026. The firm continues to
                                   strive for rapid growth through the strategy of offering differentiated design and focusing on
                                   the premium market.
                                       CE continues to grow demand for new and improved products, such as its ultra-large
                                   QLED TVs featuring premium technology, Bespoke refrigerators tailored to experience-­
                                   oriented lifestyles, extra-large dryers, module-type air purifiers, and garment care appliances.
                                   In the TV business, Samsung is developing innovative products such as 8K ultra-large TVs
                                   and Neo QLEDs, which are full of new technologies such as Lifestyle TVs—The Premier in
                                   120″–130″, The Frame, The Serif, and The Sero—which as the name suggests are designed for
                                   different lifestyles. It also develops soundbars, outdoor signage, and gaming monitors.
                                       In 2021, for QLED, Samsung planned to offer new models of enhanced Neo QLED TVs
                                   and to launch MICRO LED TVs with top features in the 80″–110″ range. In addition, Samsung
                                   plans to enhance its eco-friendly activities, including the use of eco packaging and solar-powered
                                   remote controls.
                                       Another major revenue generator in the CE division is Samsung’s digital appliance op-
                                   erations. One of the market leaders in intelligent appliances, Samsung appliances can even
                                   change colors to fit your mood and your style with Bespoke technology. Not only can appli-
                                   ances be controlled remotely with sophisticated AI technology, but Samsung appliances can
                                   also learn about users’ washing styles and suggest customized recommendations for efficiency
                                   and effectiveness.
                                       Samsung competes heavily in the healthcare segment, producing radiography, ultrasounds,
                                   and even mobile CT equipment for medical providers worldwide. Focusing on mobility in equip-
                                   ment, it seeks to enable virtually any suitable room in a hospital to be transformed into a suite ca-
                                   pable of providing advanced images to healthcare professionals. An aging population in Europe
                                   and the United States bodes well for medical products as both these regions have quality health-
                                   care and patients that have the means to afford such care. The CE segment lags significantly
                                   behind both the IM and DS segments in revenues, operating profits, and assets. The segment is
                                   also not as efficient in the “operating profits/sales” measure.

                                   IM Segment
                                   Samsung’s global market share in their IM Division’s key products has slowly decreased from
                                   17.4 percent in 2018, to 17.5 percent in 2019, to 16.2 percent in 2020. However, the company
                                   plans to spur growth of the smartphone market and deliver exceptional user experiences soon
                                   by 1) offering innovative hardware features such as OLED technology, high-definition cam-
                                   eras, biometric sensors, and battery charger technologies; 2) improving the software capabili-
                                   ties of mobile payment service Samsung Pay and AI platform Bixby; and 3) investing in the
                                   cloud, IoT, healthcare, AR, and VR. At the same time, Samsung plans to lead in the global
                                   market shift to 5G.
                                       In 2020, the smartphone portion of total phones sold was 76 percent, and the feature phone
                                   portion of the total was 24 percent, driven by demand in developing nations. As the smartphone
                                   market matures, the importance of applications such as UX, mobile payments, AI, and AR is
                                   rising alongside that of competitive hardware, which includes high-performance AMOLED dis-
                                   plays, foldable form factors, multiple cameras, sensors, waterproof and dustproof designs, and
                                   biometric recognition.
                                       In 2020, Samsung led the mobile technology trend by introducing the Galaxy Z Flip, which
                                   folds from the top, and the Galaxy Z Fold 2. In addition, Samsung now offers the A Series and
                                   offers new and innovative user experiences by leading the convergence of technologies such as
                                   5G, AI, and IoT. Samsung plans to provide a more colorful and easy-to-use mobile experience

               for smartphone users through services such as Samsung Pay, Samsung Health, and SmartThings
               and via connections with premium tablets including the Galaxy Tab S, wearable devices such as
               smartwatches, Wi-Fi Bluetooth earphones, and other accessories.
                   The Samsung IM segment is likely what many consumers think of first when they hear
               the brand’s name. As of 2021, Samsung has annual sales of over 400 million mobile phones
               across the globe. Notable products include the Galaxy, Knox, and Bixby, in addition to
               tablets and PCs and wearables. PCs are making a comeback as remote work is becoming
               more accepted and common around the world. Samsung also produces simpler smartphones
               and non-smart phones to better serve a global marketplace as mentioned previously. In
               fact, industrywide, non-smart phones are projected to continue to outpace smartphone sales
               through 2025.
                   To support both mobile devices and other smart devices, within the DS segment Samsung
               is aggressively producing chips and devices, including modems and other equipment that
               work with all products, but particularly well with Samsung products. While these products
               are not mainstream yet, Samsung is heavily investing in R&D to introduce these products in
               the United States, South Korea, and Japan. In 2019, Samsung secured a major 5G contract
               in the United States.
               DS Segment
               As stated earlier, Samsung’s DS Division includes the company’s Semiconductor (SC) and
               Display Panel (DP) businesses. Samsung’s global market share in the SC business has slowly
               declined from 43.9 percent in 2018, to 43.7 percent in 2019, to 43.1 percent in 2020. Its global
               market share of smartphone panels within its DP business has declined overall, from 47.6 percent
               in 2018, to 43.6 percent in 2019, to 43.8 percent in 2020.
                   Samsung’s SC business is divided into Memory (storage) and System LSI (logical process-
               ing). Samsung’s memory SC business is further divided into RAM products and ROM products.
               RAM is called volatile memory, as the information is deleted when the power is turned off. It is
               used for temporary loading and storage of application programs. ROM is nonvolatile and holds
               memory even when power is removed; it is used in input/output systems, IC cards, and other
               components. For System LSI products, there are many categories for various applications, with
               central processing units (CPUs) for PCs, mobile devices, and servers forming the largest market.
               System LSI products have a wide range of applications, such as household electronics, networks,
               and games. Samsung manufactures image sensors as well as mobile APs for smartphones and
               tablets. As part of the company’s SC operations, the Foundry Business makes customized semi-
               conductors for other companies based on customer designs. In other words, companies consign
               the manufacturing of their products to fabrication plants, also called foundries or fabs. The num-
               ber of fabless semiconductor companies is growing.
                   Samsung’s mobile DP panel business’s differentiated technology is a main factor behind the
               increased adoption of OLED panels, supported by its release of new products such as foldable
               devices, rollable devices, and automotive components. Samsung today is focusing on the large
               panel business and premium products such as high-definition, ultra-large QD TVs and is enhanc-
               ing its competitiveness through continuous improvements in technology and productivity.
                   As the first to secure core technology in next-generation DRAM development and to achieve
               a breakthrough in advanced node processes, Samsung is the only player in the industry to mass-
               produce products based on extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography. Samsung is conducting full-
               fledged migration to 6th-generation V-NAND while actively addressing mobile and laptop SSD
               demand. Foundry demand is expected to remain strong in 2021–2023 due to competition be-
               tween fabless customers and growing demand for data centers and PCs.
                   In 2021, amid accelerating penetration of 5G smartphones, Samsung plans to improve the
               basic features of OLED panels as smartphone makers increasingly favor power efficiency and
               ultra-thin design. Samsung plans to offer increased accessibility of foldable products.

               Harman Segment
               Acquired in 2017, Samsung’s Harman division is a global leader in the market for connected car
               systems, audio and visual products, professional solutions, and connected services. Samsung’s
               global market share of digital cockpits has increased from 18.8 percent in 2018, to 24.8 percent
               in 2019, to 27.5 percent in 2020.

                                       Samsung’s sales, operating profit, and total assets by segment are provided in Exhibit 4.
                                   Note the increases in total assets in every category for 2020 except Harman. In 2020, CE re-
                                   ported net sales of KRW 48.1 trillion (20.3 percent of total net sales) and IM reported net sales
                                   of KRW 99.58 trillion (42.1 percent). DS contributed about 43.5 percent of net sales: KRW
                                   72.85 trillion (30.8 percent) by the semiconductor sub-division and KRW 30.58 trillion (12.9
                                   percent) by the DP Business Unit. The Harman Division reported net sales of KRW 9.18 tril-
                                   lion (3.9 percent); this segment is the least efficient of all when dividing operating sales by
                                   revenues.

                                       The Harman division’s revenue and operating profit in 2020 declined year-over-year as
                                   COVID-19 weakened demand from automotive companies and consumers. Revenue decreased
                                   by KRW 893.3 billion (8.9 percent) to KRW 9.2 trillion and profitability decreased by KRW
                                   266.8 billion (82.8 percent) to KRW 55.5 billion. The Harman segment is working hard to en-

                                   Samsung is spearheading technology innovations such as the world’s first 5G telematics control
                                   unit (TCU). In the consumer audio market, Harman’s portable Bluetooth speakers and earphones
                                   have achieved the highest market share for several years based on brand reputation, leading the
                                   consumer audio market.

                   Exhibit 5 provides a summary of Samsung’s sales by region. Note the reduction in sales from
               2018 in China and in the Asia and Africa region. It is important to observe and consider just how
               strong a grip Samsung has on its home market of South Korea based on total sales and on the
               potential for expansion in the United States and Europe in particular. South Korea had a popula-
               tion in 2020 of about 51 million, compared to 330 million for the United States and 770 million
               for Europe. Despite Europe having 15 times the population as South Korea, sales in this region
               were only 19 percent greater in 2020 than Samsung’s home country sales.

               Competitors and External Issues
               As a conglomerate, Samsung must contend with rivals that specialize in the various industries
               that Samsung competes in. For example, in smartphones, Samsung competes with Apple, which
               focuses almost entirely on PCs, phones, tablets, and wearables. In semiconductors, Samsung
               competes with the best, such as Intel, which specializes only in semiconductors. Is being diversi-
               fied a good strategic strategy for Samsung?

               Phones, PCs, Tablets, and Wearables
               Samsung competes with many players in this industry, including household names such as
               Apple, Lenovo, and Dell. Exhibit 6 reveals trends from 2020 to 2025 and expected sales in
               units sold worldwide. Note the strong demand for mobile phones that are not classified as
               smartphones; this demand is expected to continue up to 2025, but some estimates suggest
               the profit margin is higher on smartphones than traditional phones. While many people own
               wearables, wearables are not included in Exhibit 6 because sales volume is significantly
               lower than the other four categories. PC sales are expected to increase due to more work at
               home and remote working arrangements as well as the release of new video-conferencing
               solutions.

                                   in downward pressure on per-unit cost, also cutting into profit margins. Cardiovascular, ir-
                                   radiation, recovery, and neuromodulation devices are the most common, accounting for 23,
                                   21, and 10 percent of all devices in use. The industry is fragmented in the U.S. market, with
                                   Medtronic accounting for 28 percent of the market share and Abbot Laboratories and GE ac-
                                   counting for 10 percent each. The other estimated 1,000 businesses compete for the remain-
                                   ing 50 percent of the market share. Similar fragmentation is present in the global market.

                                   Appliances
                                   The appliance market has a profit margin of over 7 percent and over 150 businesses com-
                                   peting globally. Large firms in the industry are Whirlpool, Haier, and Electrolux, with over
                                   60 percent of the market share in the U.S. market. However, annual growth worldwide is
                                   expected to be less than 3 percent up to 2026. Cooking appliances account for 28 percent of
                                   sales, refrigerators and freezers account for 25 percent, and laundry equipment accounts for
                                   about 21 percent. A successful marketing campaign on the benefits of owning a dryer could
                                   possibly increase laundry equipment’s market share. All other appliances account for the
                                   remaining market share. Many firms have yet to catch up with the trend of home appliances
                                   having smart applications. Products that have smart capabilities also have higher profit mar-
                                   gins, and industry players are hoping that they can convince customers to make the switch.
                                   The trend of energy-efficient appliances has come at the expense of quality, with many new
                                   customers frustrated at products that in many cases do not work well, which increases op-
                                   portunities for R&D and firms to produce smart, energy-efficient appliances that do work as
                                   well as older models.

                                   Audio Equipment
                                   Samsung’s Harman division has two segments: consumer audio and professional audio.
                                   Consumer audio (smart audio, headphones, connected audio solutions, etc.) has just a few major
                                   competitors, such as Amazon, Apple, Beats, Bose, and Ultimate Ears. Smartphone manufactur-
                                   ers dominate market share in Bluetooth headsets, and the market is expected to grow rapidly
                                   for the next decade. The professional audio industry (commercial audio, audio for large venues,
                                   lighting, and video and control solutions) is led by QSC and Yamaha. In the connected systems
                                   business within the automotive industry, competition is fierce among rival firms, which include
                                   Alpine, Aptiv, Continental, Mitsubishi, Panasonic, and Visteon. There are several major competi-
                                   tors in car audio systems, including Bose, Pioneer, and Panasonic.

               Semiconductors
               The semiconductor business is expected to report sales worth over $500 billion annually in 2022
               and beyond, with 35 percent of sales in China and over $140 billion in sales to support mobile
               phones. Expected sales of cars with embedded systems are expected to grow over 20 percent
               in 2022. Semiconductor sales grew 14 percent alone during 2020. The largest semiconductor
               competitors as of early 2021 by market capitulation were Intel, Samsung, TSMC, SK Hynix, and
               Micron. SK Hynix is a large competitor for Samsung based in its home market of South Korea.
               Six of the top 10 semiconductor firms based on market cap are in the United States, with only
               one firm in the top 10, Infineon, located in Europe. Exhibit 7 reveals the top 5 semiconductor

                   In 2020, the price of wafers for semiconductor disks declined about 2 percent, while prices
               of tempered glass windows increased about 1 percent. As per the Semiconductor (SC) part of
               DS, the demand for DRAM grew about 22 percent in 2020, led by server application products. In
               2021, the market is expected to expand by another 15 percent thanks to the acceleration of digital
               transformation, mainly from contactless businesses. Smartphone and datacenter server demand
               is also expected to increase as the economy recovers. The SC business’s 2020 revenue increased
               by KRW 7.9 trillion (12.2 percent) from the previous year to KRW 72.85 trillion due to strong
               server and mobile demand. Operating profit increased by KRW 4.78 trillion (34.2 percent) to
               KRW 18.80 trillion year-over-year.
                   Samsung is the only firm in the memory semiconductor industry using the EUV lithography
               process in the mass production of memory semiconductors, as mentioned above. In the foundry
               business, demand continues to be strong as smartphone manufacturers look to benefit from U.S.
               sanctions against Huawei.
                   Active-matrix technology is most commonly used in displays (that is, screens in electronic
               devices), including organic light-emitting diode (OLED) panels and thin film transistor liquid
               crystal display (TFT-LCD). OLED panels use organic materials, which offer sharp contrast and
               color, high color gamut, and fast response rates. A TFT-LCD panel is a liquid crystal-based
               display that features a thinner and lighter profile while offering high resolution. The market for
               smartphone OLED panels in 2021 is expected to be around 600 million units and is forecast to
               continue expanding with the growth of 5G smartphone demand.

               Conclusion
               Strategy Considerations
               With Samsung producing many different products in its segments, it is important to consider
               when developing a strategic plan how the firm should allocate both its monetary and human
               capital resources across product lines and regions. Factors to consider should include expansion

                                   as well as divesture of certain segments to free up resources for more profitable segments. Can
                                   Samsung continue to compete with homogeneous firms that only focus on medical equipment
                                   or appliances? Even if Samsung could compete here, would the firm be more profitable if it ex-
                                   panded its smartphones and TV production and reduced R&D on appliances? Should Samsung
                                   continue to cater to both the high-end market and the lower-end markets on phones? Does
                                   producing lower-end phones lower the perceived brand quality of higher-end phones? Should
                                   Samsung continue to cater to both a commercial and a retail market?
                                       A careful analysis of the competitors and available opportunities within segments is needed
                                   along with that of Samsung’s strengths and weaknesses to plot a strategy for the company.
                                   Remember, your job is not to describe what Samsung is currently doing or what Samsung plans
                                   to do based on reading press releases or the company’s Annual Report, but instead is to imagine
                                   that you have been hired by Samsung to develop and provide a 3-year strategic plan. Samsung’s
                                   upper management, and in this case your classmates and professor, are looking for you (or pay-
                                   ing you a high fee if actually hired by Samsung) to recommend what you feel is the best direction
                                   for the firm based on your strategic management research, knowledge, and expertise.
                                       Consumers globally are becoming increasingly price-sensitive but also demanding perfec-
                                   tion in the devices they buy. People are also willing to pay a premium for quality and brand
                                   awareness. These trends, coupled with increased competition from rival firms in many industries,
                                   call for a comprehensive Samsung strategic plan to be developed. Recall from the case that
                                   Samsung is a conglomerate doing business in multiple industries against firms that often spe-
                                   cialize in the industry they compete in. Conglomerates were very popular in the 1960s but have
                                   increasingly become rare with a few exceptions, such as Samsung, Walt Disney, and 3M. Does
                                   Samsung need to “stick with the knitting” to be successful today, or in other words, should it be
                                   doing one thing really well, offering the best value to consumers, rather than striving to be an
                                   expert in everything?
                                       Prepare a clear 3-year strategic plan for Samsung indicating the direction you think will be
                                   most advantageous for management. Consider a new mission statement if needed as well as new
                                   strategies that provide guidance regarding which divisions should be strengthened and which
                                   divisions, if any, should possibly be divested. Deciding how to allocate resources across seg-
                                   ments is a difficult but major challenge—and the job of a strategist. Prepare projected financial
                                   statements, if at all possible, to show your expectations regarding the financial impact of your
                                   proposed strategies.

               www.lenovo.com
               Lenovo Group Limited (Lenovo) (HKSE: 992) (ADR: LNVGY) is a Chinese multinational tech-
               nology firm that has global headquarters in Beijing, China, operational headquarters in Morrisville,
               North Carolina, in the United States, and an operational center in Singapore. Lenovo is the world’s
               largest personal computer (PC) manufacturer and is a major producer of laptops, tablet computers,
               smartphones, workstations, peripherals, printers, scanners, servers, supercomputers, IT manage-
               ment software, storage devices, modems, routers, wearables, and smart televisions.
                   Lenovo’s brand name products include the Legion, ThinkPad, ThinkBook, IdeaPad, Yoga,
               IdeaCentre, ThinkCentre, ThinkStation, ThinkVision displays, ThinkServer, ThinkSystem, and
               numerous other items such as Motorola Razr smartphones. With operations in over 60 countries
               and revenue derived from about 180, Lenovo has research centers in Beijing, Chengdu, Yamato

               Lenovo has the leading market share (about 27 percent) of all PCs sold in the world. Lenovo’s
               fiscal year (2021) at the time of writing ended March 31, 2021.

               History
               Lenovo was founded by Liu Chuanzhi along with a group of engineers in Beijing in 1984.
               Computers were not the company’s original business; under the name Legend, it originally spe-
               cialized in televisions. The business was incorporated in Hong Kong in 1988, but it gained the in-
               ternational spotlight when it acquired IBM’s PC business in 2005 and then its Intel-based server
               business in 2014. Lenovo entered the smartphone market in 2012, and by 2014 it was the largest
               supplier of smartphones in mainland China. Lenovo acquired Motorola Mobility from Google in
               2014 and in 2017 acquired Fujitsu’s personal computer business.
                   For calendar 2020, Lenovo reported revenue of $60.7 billion, up 19.8 percent year-over-year,
               and net income of $1.2 billion, up 77 percent. The company’s services, software, and solutions
               accounted for 8 percent of the total revenue and was growing twice as fast as the company’s
               overall sales of hardware and software products.

               Vision/Mission
               A $60-billion-revenue Fortune Global 500 company, Lenovo’s vision describes its goal as helping
               to create a diverse, honest, sustainable “digital society” through innovative, leading technology for
               customers globally, “powering” them through devices and infrastructure and “empowering” them
               through solutions, services, and software.

                                          For the 2021 fiscal year, MBG achieved its highest market shares ever in LA and NA, while
                                      DCG maintained is leading position globally in HPC and AI. In April 2021, Lenovo reorganized
                                      itself into three strategic business units (SBUs) to better deliver on the company’s 3S Strategy
                                      (Smart IoT, Smart Infrastructure, Smart Solutions). Previously, there were only 2 groups (IDG
                                      and ISG). Specifically, the three SBU groups today are
                                       1. IDG (Intelligent Devices Group), which produces various smart devices and IoT, and includes
                                          PCSD and MBG. The products include the ThinkPad X1 Laptop, ThinkPad P17 Workstation,
                                          ThinkStation 340, the Motorola Razr and Edge smartphones, modems, routers, and wearables.
                                       2. ISG (Infrastructure Solutions Group, renamed from DCG, Data Center Group), which produces
                                          Smart Infrastructure.
                                       3. SSG (Solutions and Services Group), which produces Smart Verticals & Services, designed to spur
                                          business across verticals, attached services, and managed services, including DaaS and Truscale.

                                      Lenovo’s board of directors declared a dividend of 3.09 U.S. cents or 24 HK cents per share for

                   •   It was the best Q4 ever for Lenovo’s PC and Smart Devices (PCSD), which reported

                                   22 percent to $48 billion. Given a booming e-learning industry in 2020–2021, partly due to COVID-19,
                                   the IDG Group reported a 219 percent increase in its Chromebook revenue. The company’s Smart IoT
                                   revenues grew 43 percent in fiscal 2020–2021, led by Smart Verticals such as Smart Health Care in
                                   North America, Smart Education, and Smart City in China.
                                       For fiscal 2021, Lenovo’s DCG Group (now called ISG) reported its highest-ever revenue
                                   of $6.3 billion, up 15 percent from the prior year and comprising 10 percent of total company
                                   revenues. Especially strong contributors to the DCG results were its CSP, ESMB, SDI, and HPC/
                                   AI businesses. Specifically within DCG, HPC/AI maintained its no. 1 position in the global Top
                                   500 Supercomputer list.
                                       At the end of fiscal 2021, SSG was formed to focus on Attached Services, Managed Services
                                   such as as-a-service offerings, and Project and Vertical Solutions. These products are tailored
                                   to financial services companies, large food retailers and distributors, sporting events, and other
                                   technology companies.

               External Issues
               In Q1 of 2021, sales of PCs and tablets skyrocketed. Global shipments of traditional PCs, in-
               cluding desktops, notebooks, and workstations, grew 55.9 percent compared to Q1 2020, with
               84.3 million units shipped. Tablets especially were in high demand, with a 55.4 percent growth
               and shipments totaling 39.9 million units; Chromebook shipments totaled 13.2 million units in
               Q1 of 2021. High demand was accompanied, however, by increases in average selling prices due
               to fast growth in videogaming and advanced touchscreens within the education segment. Some
               analysts predicted an increase in demand for tablets of 12 percent in 2021 after the 13.6 percent
               increase the prior year.

    420    STRATEGIC-MANAGEMENT CASE ANALYSIS

                                       All three major segments in the PC market (consumer, education, and commercial) are low
                                   on inventory, especially the consumer segment. Thousands of customers are settling for desktops
                                   due to the unavailability of notebooks, including governments and corporate customers. It should
                                   be noted here that the rising popularity of Chromebooks is quickly eroding demand for tablets in
                                   markets such as the United States, Western Europe, and more recently, Japan. As lockdowns due
                                   to COVID-19 wane, however, it is expected that consumers will travel more and demand for all
                                   PC variants will level off instead of continuing their robust rise.
                                       People are spending more time using devices, buying more devices, and upgrading their
                                   devices. There is pent-up demand following the pandemic. Even 6-year-old children today wear
                                   smart watches and use them to interact constantly with their parents and the world around them.
                                   There are numerous key technologies driving the device innovation agenda: people want to
                                   look better in video calls with computational photography technology, they want to hear better
                                   through microphones with AI-based active noise cancellation, and they want to see better with
                                   low blue light flicker-free screens to reduce eye strain. To meet these changing consumer desires,
                                   Lenovo is enhancing its ThinkBook Plus Gen 2, ThinkReality A3 smart glasses, Yoga AIO 7, and
                                   many other related products.
                                       One of today’s consumer trends is faster infrastructure upgrades and purchases of devices
                                   that offer not just hardware but also solutions anchored by AI. Hundreds of smart devices are
                                   being developed and purchased, ranging from smart medical devices and machine tools to smart
                                   home, car, and work systems. Data increasingly needs to be stored, organized, and analyzed for
                                   machine learning, and this requires more computing power, which requires high-speed networks
                                   like 5G and 6G and fiber-optic advancements to avoid “traffic jams” when too much data gets
                                   transmitted between client and cloud.
                                       In the Lenovo 2021 Annual Report on pages 24–35, the company details numerous external risk
                                   factors that include issues related to COVID-19, cyberattacks, new competitors, existing competitors,
                                   economic factors, political and regulatory uncertainty, privacy concerns, employee diversity and wel-
                                   fare concerns, intellectual property risks, supply chain concerns, climate change, corruption issues,
                                   and pollution problems. Lenovo has received numerous awards for being a great place to work, as
                                   detailed on page 43–45 in their 2020–2021 Annual Report. The company has been recognized by
                                   Corporate Knights as one of the 100 most sustainable corporations in the world.
                                       The demand for 5G advancements and for wearables is expected to increase 6 percent in
                                   2021 and 5 percent in 2022. Upgrades to expect are a new 5G modem chip from Qualcomm,
                                   better battery life, and a faster A15 processor from Taiwan Semiconductor. The iPhone 13 is
                                   expected soon, and iPhone units sold are estimated to increase 25 percent in fiscal year 2021
                                   over the prior year, followed by a 4 percent increase in 2022. Among all phones, smartphones
                                   now comprise about 82 percent, up from 80 percent in 2020. Some analysts project an 18- to
                                   20-­percent increase in PC shipments in 2021 as companies allow employees to work from home
                                   more and schools transition to more and more online courses.
                                       Exhibit 7 provides a forecast of the global smartphone market share across countries. Note
                                   that China + Asia is over 50 percent. Restrictions imposed by the U.S. government on the Chinese
                                   firm Huawei have benefited Lenovo, Apple, and Samsung.

               Tablets
               Tablet shipments globally increased 19.6 percent in Q4 of 2020 compared with the prior-year
               quarter and recorded double-digit unit growth for the whole year. Worldwide tablet shipments
               grew 13.6 percent, and this momentum is persisting, with growth of 12 percent in mid-2021.
               Demand for detachable tablets was especially strong, growing 33.6 percent in Q4 2020, com-
               pared to the prior-year quarter, for total shipments of 24.1 million units. By producer from high-
               est to lowest, Apple, Samsung, Microsoft, Lenovo, and Huawei comprised the top 5 detachable
               tablet suppliers, with close to 96 percent market share.
                   Per region, the largest market for detachable tablets during Q4 2020 was the United States,
               followed by Asia Pacific (including Japan) and then Western Europe. In terms of segment
               growth, the consumer detachable market across the globe saw 17.4 million units being shipped
               for a growth rate of 30.3 percent compared with the prior-year quarter. On the other hand, com-
               mercial detachable shipments touched 6.7 million units, growing 43.1 compared with the prior-
               year quarter. In contrast, in Q4 2020, the slate tablet market grew 9.7 percent compared with
               the prior-year quarter, reaching 28.1 million units. Android slate tablets comprised 96 percent
               of total slate volume shipped, with the leading suppliers being Samsung, Lenovo, Amazon,
               Huawei, and TCL.

               Competitors
               Over 100 companies compete against Lenovo. A few of these rivals are listed and described
               below.

               Apple, Inc.
               Headquartered in Cupertino, California, Apple designs and produces a wide variety of con-
               sumer electronic devices, including smartphones (iPhones), tablets (iPads), PCs (Macs), and
               smartwatches (Apple Watches). The iPhone makes up the majority of Apple’s total revenue,
               but the MacBookPro laptop competes directly with Lenovo’s PCs. While Lenovo is trying to
               shift more to a services company, Apple already offers its customers a variety of services such
               as Apple Music, iCloud, Apple Care, Apple TV+, Apple Arcade, Apple Card, and Apple Pay.
               Unlike Lenovo products, Apple’s products are distributed online as well as through company-
               owned stores and third-party retailers. Apple generates roughly 40 percent of its revenue from
               the Americas, with the remainder earned internationally.

               Dell Technologies, Inc.
               Headquartered in Round Rock, Texas, and competing with Lenovo, Dell Technologies is a lead-
               ing global provider of servers and storage products as well as PCs, peripherals, and virtualization

                                   Other Competitors
                                   Headquartered in Palo Alto, California, Hewlett-Packard designs, produces, and distributes
                                   a wide variety of computer hardware, software, peripherals, printers, and more for global
                                   markets.
                                       Headquartered in New Taipei City, Taiwan, Acer ranks among the world’s top 5 branded
                                   PC suppliers. This multinational computer technology and electronics corporation manufactures
                                   desktop and laptop PCs, personal digital assistants (PDAs), servers, storage devices, displays,
                                   smartphones, peripherals, and hardware.

                                   factures and supplies all kinds of electrical products, including laptops, notebooks, computer

                                   ware, software, networking, and business solutions.
                                       Headquartered in Tokyo, Japan, NEC Corporation is a Japanese multinational IT company
                                   that provides information technology (IT) and network solutions. NEC is one of the world’s

                                   Conclusion
                                   In July 2021, Lenovo introduced the next generation of its entry-level desktop worksta-
                                   tions, the ThinkStation P350 Tower, Small Form Factor (SFF), and Tiny. These products are
                                   equipped with cutting-edge storage technologies and enhanced professional graphics support.
                                   They are Lenovo’s most powerful entry-level offerings, delivering a complete package of size
                                   options.
                                        In June 2021, Lenovo introduced a series of smarter devices including the Lenovo Yoga Tab
                                   13, the new Lenovo Yoga Tab 11, the powerful Lenovo Tab P11 Plus Android™ tablet, and the
                                   Lenovo Smart Clock 2. Lenovo realizes that consumers are increasingly using their tablets for
                                   streaming, gaming, learning, and more screen time, as the lines separating our relaxation time
                                   from hours spent working or learning start to blur.
                                        Lenovo is also acutely interested in the rapidly growing hearables (smart headphones) and
                                   wearables (smartwatch) market. There is a growing shift in the wearables industry from a
                                   focus on fitness to offering broader healthcare solutions, such as the new Apple Watch Series
                                   6, which provides a sensor to measure one’s blood oxygen level. It should be noted here that
                                   China is well ahead of the United States in terms of 5G broadband availability and is a fa-
                                   vorable competitive landscape for Lenovo given that Huawei has been penalized by the U.S.
                                   government.
                                        Lenovo definitely needs to maintain and likely grow its leadership position in the worldwide
                                   PC industry. Demand across the globe remains strong and in some cases was at record levels in
                                   2020. PC demand is accelerating globally as students need reliable systems to be productive and
                                   corporate upgrades abound. Lenovo’s 72.7 million PC shipments in 2020 led all rival firms with
                                   a 24 percent market share, followed by HP in second place with 67.6 million PC shipments for
                                   a market share of 22.4 percent (23.5 percent in 2019). Dell sold 50.3 million devices in 2020 for
                                   third place with a 16.6 percent market share, while Apple followed in fourth, shipping 23.1 mil-
                                   lion PCs for a 7.6 percent share, and finally, Acer had a 6.9 percent market share, having shipped
                                   about 21 million devices.
                                        Lenovo expects to capitalize on the fact that smart home technology increasingly enables
                                   nearly everything in our homes—from our alarm systems, to air-conditioners, to thermostats,
                                   to lights, to garage doors—to be connected to the Internet and be remotely controlled with our
                                   phones or smart speakers. The largest impetus to smart homes will be greater access to high-
                                   speed Internet, with the roll-out of 5G as well as the emergence of smarter assistants like Amazon
                                   Alexa and Google Assistant.

                   Lenovo strives to stay ahead of competitors on all fronts, even as rival firms introduce ad-
               vanced products and services that compete with all Lenovo offerings on a daily basis. A com-
               prehensive strategic plan is needed for Lenovo to maintain its dominance in some areas and its
               desired dominance in other product and service industries.

                                   Dick’s Sporting Goods—2018
                                   www.dickssportinggoods.com (DKS)
                                   Headquartered in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, Dick’s Sporting Goods (Dick’s) is a large chain of
                                   brick-and-mortar retail stores that offers a wide selection of sporting equipment, footwear, ap-
                                   parel, and accessories such as tennis rackets, weights, outdoor cooking equipment, bicycles,
                                   sports clothing and much more. By some accounts, Dick’s is the largest sporting goods store in
                                   the United States based on 2017 revenues, larger than Bass Pro Shops, Academy Sports, and Big
                                   5 Sporting Goods. Dick’s also operates Golf Galaxy, Field & Stream, and Dick’s Team Sports
                                   HQ. Dick’s Team Sports HQ is targeted at youth sports and provides league management ser-
                                   vices free of charge including scorekeeping, scheduling, and custom uniform designs.
                                       Competition is intense in the retail business, especially in the brick-and-mortar sporting
                                   goods retail business. In 2017, for example, Gander Mountain filed for bankruptcy and closed
                                   most of their stores. Dick’s is counting on its 1) updated website, 2) store-in-a-store concept, 3)
                                   talented sales people, 4) in-store demonstrations, and 5) a wide range of products at different
                                   price points. However, brick-and-mortar retailers are struggling so Dick’s faces a precarious
                                   future and needs a clear strategic plan.
                                       In May 2018, Dick’s Sporting Goods hired three lobbyists to push Congress for gun control
                                   measures, irritating many of its gun enthusiasts customers. Specifically, Dick’s hired two
                                   Democrats and one Republican from the Washington-based public affairs firm Glover Park
                                   Group, with the only specific lobbying issue listed for their work is “lobbying related to gun
                                   control.”

                                   History
                                   In 1948, an 18-year-old named Richard “Dick” Stack was working for an army surplus store
                                   in Binghamton, New York, and was assigned to research and develop several tactics for adding
                                   fishing and camping product lines to the business. Upon presenting his research and suggestions,
                                   the owner rudely called Dick a “dumb kid,” rejecting his work and ideas.
                                       Distraught, but convinced he was right about the fishing market in Binghamton, Dick consulted
                                   with his grandmother. She asked: “Dick, how much would it would cost you to build the store
                                   yourself.” Dick responded, “It will cost me $300.” His grandmother then went to the cookie jar
                                   where she kept her life savings and gave Dick $300 and told him “Do it yourself.” Dick used that
                                   money to rent a storefront and purchase inventory for a new bait-and-tackle shop in Binghamton.
                                       Dick was determined to succeed despite the first few years of mediocre sales. By the 1960s
                                   however, Dick had two stores and formally named the company Dick’s Sporting Goods. Dick
                                   Stack served as CEO of his company until his retirement in 1984, passing the torch to his son
                                   Edward (Ed) who is currently the Chairman and CEO of Dick’s Sporting Goods. However, when
                                   Ed took the reigns from his father, there were still only two Dick’s stores in operation. Young
                                   and energetic and having worked his way up the chain since 1977, Ed quickly put the business
                                   on an expansion route, opening multiple stores in the early 1990s, and ultimately moving the
                                   headquarters to Pittsburgh in 1994.
                                       Dick’s Sporting Goods went public on the New York Stock Exchange on October 15,
                                   2002 under the ticker symbol DKS. As of February 3, 2018, the company operates 716 Dick’s
                                   Sporting Goods stores in the United States.

               name brand products, an excellent selection, fair prices, and a knowledgeable and helpful staff of
               employees.
                   Dick’s does not have a formal vision statement, but the company strives to serve customers
               in a manner that they will recognize Dick’s as the number-one sports and fitness retailer that
               serves a wide array of athletes and outdoor enthusiasts.

               Code of Business Ethics
               Dick’s Sporting Goods provides separate codes of conduct for associates, vendors, and direc-
               tors. As CEO Ed Stack mentions in a letter to teammates, he is on a mission to ensure Dick’s
               plays the game fairly while continuing to offer shareholders value, rewarding loyal customers,
               and treating associates fairly. Mr. Stack suggests all associates, vendors, and directors read their
               respective codes and the codes of the others as an athlete would read a playbook or game plan
               for an athletic event. All team members are expected to prevent unfair play and report any oc-
               currences to their HR representative or anonymously on Dick’s Ethics Hotline. Dick’s ensures
               protection for whistle blowers promising there will be no retaliation on your employment.

               Internal Issues
               Organizational Structure
               Dick Stack’s (founder) son, Ed Stack has served as chairman and CEO of Dick’s Sporting Goods
               since 1984, having started with the company full-time in 1977. Based on the executive titles
               ­illustrated in Exhibit 1, it appears that Dick’s operates from a divisional-by-product type struc-
                ture composed of three segments: softlines, hardlines, and team sports. Hardlines are basically
                anything except footwear and apparel. However, since an official organizational chart is not
                made public, likely only insiders know exactly who reports to who in the company.

               Current Strategies
               Dick’s operates in a highly competitive market where customers can purchase from traditional
               retailers or simply purchase from online merchants including Amazon and eBay where virtually
               anybody can be a merchant and barriers to entry are slim. However, Dick’s has done well with net
               income up over 12 percent in the year ending February 2018. The company offers a wide selec-
               tion of brands ranging in prices (according to Dick’s) from good to excellent, providing custom-
               ers of all income levels and athletic skill levels attractive products. Dick’s is committed to hiring
               expert personal in the various departments of the store. For example, if someone is in the market
               for a bicycle, Dick’s has bicycle mechanics on staff who often have the same level of knowledge
               one would find in a bicycle specialty shop.
                    If someone wants to hit golf balls, they can go to Dick’s golf hitting bay and work with
               coaches to help select the right clubs. If they want instead to shoot a bow or test out new running
               shoes, they can simply shoot a few arrows in the archery lane or hop on a treadmill in the store,
               all supported by knowledgeable employees. This level of service is one way Dick’s competes with
               online merchants as customers are not as likely to “showroom” (browse the store then go buy on-
               line for a cheaper source) if they received such personal and dedicated attention. It is also a great
               way to build customer loyalty and attract people into the store.
                    In 2017, Dick’s transitioned from outsourcing its e-commerce platforms to performing these
               tasks in-house in what Dicks hopes will provide increased control and allow the firm to target
               and interact with customers more effectively. Dick’s is aggressively adding Field & Stream
               stores inside existing Dick’s Sporting Goods stores in hopes of cross selling fishing gear with
               other sporting goods products. In addition, Dick’s offers Golf Galaxy stores inside select Dick’s
               stores. Dick’s markets itself as offering multiple specialty shops inside each store; footwear,
               team sports, outdoor lodge, fitness and others are all considered specialty stores by some mea-
               sures. Adding similar store-in-a-store concepts is a viable strategy many firms are starting to
               employ in hopes of increasing foot traffic.
                    Dick’s offers many popular brands including Asics, Adidas, Nike, Columbia, Callaway Golf,
               TaylorMade, Under Armour, and Yeti. Offering famous brands aids in attracting customers into
               Dick’s stores. Dick’s also offers several private label brands which tend to have higher profit mar-
               gins than brand names. Several private label brands include: Field & Stream, Fitness Gear, Lady
               Hagen, CALIA of women’s athletic apparel, Top-Flite, Quest, and others. Private label brands

               account for about 10 percent of company wide sales, but Dick’s is planning to aggressively ex-
               pand private brands, in particular its CALIA line. Dick’s also has agreements from several brand
               name firms to be an excusive provider, including Slazenger, Umbro, Reebok, and others.
                   Dick’s is somewhat dependent on Nike and Under Armour for its products as the two ac-
               count for 20 and 12 percent, respectively, of Dick’s sales. No other firm accounts for more than
               10 percent out of the remaining 1,400 vendors.

               Finance
               The income statements in Exhibit 2 reveal that Dick’s had a successful year ending in February
               3, 2018, with sales up over 8 percent and net income up 12.5 percent. Unlike many firms, Dick’s
               does not appear to have received a substantial tax break in the latest calendar year stemming
               from the new corporate tax laws in the United States. Being 100 percent U.S.-based, the new tax
               laws should benefit Dick’s significantly as all their revenue is from the United States.
                     The balance sheets in Exhibit 3 reveal that Dick’s remains in the mist of a stock buy back
               program that is expected to last until at least 2020. The firm’s stock price declined over 50 percent
               from late 2016 to late 2017 so purchasing stock at low prices and betting on yourself may be a posi-
               tive move for Dick’s if the firm is able to regain its equity price footing. Signs are positive based on
               the company’s revenue and net income increases, but most brick-and-mortar retailers are having
               difficulty competing with Amazon and other online competitors.

               Segment Data
               Exhibit 4 reveals Dick’s revenues by product type. Hardlines comprise 45 percent of revenues.
               Hardlines include fishing rods, basketballs, cookware, bicycles, and any other products that is
               not considered apparel or footwear. Despite hardlines accounting for a larger portion of revenue,
               softlines (footwear and apparel) account for a combined 55 percent of revenue. This comes as
               little surprise if you recall that Nike and Under Armour account for 32 percent of Dick’s sales
               and both predominantly supply Dick’s with softgoods.

               Locations Map
               Exhibit 5 reveals Dick’s store locations by region. Both Dick’s Sporting Goods and Specialty
               Concept Stores are included in Exhibit 5. Specialty Concept Stores account for 15 percent
               of stores and include Golf Galaxy and Field & Stream with some free-standing and some
               combined with Dick’s Sporting Goods stores. Dick’s added a net of 55 stores in fiscal 2016.
               Dick’s home market of the Northeast trails the Southeast in total number of stores by a wide
               margin.

                   Consolidation through acquisitions or bankruptcies within the industry has helped firms, like
               Dick’s, by eliminating competition. A reduction in the number of wholesalers who used to sup-
               ply firms like Dick’s with many of their products are fewer in number, now allowing all firms in
               the industry to cut out this middleman and do business directly with the manufacturers. Overall,
               the industry is valued at over $50 billion annually.
                   The United States has a whopping 40,000 sporting goods businesses, including Dick’s and
               Bass Pro Shops, but also thousands of mom-and-pop bait and tackle stores located on small
               creeks, rivers, lakes, and coastal areas across the United States. The Internet is also a major
               player now, as many people purchase sporting goods and fishing equipment directly from China
               on eBay and other websites, often at bottom line prices.
                   The main drivers of revenue in the industry are not footwear or athletic apparel but rather
               sporting equipment such as exercise stuff, golf, team sport items such as football and baseball
               gear, hunting, fishing, and camping gear. In total, about 64 percent of industry revenues are de-
               rived from sporting equipment, while 17 percent is derived from athletic apparel. and 12 percent
               from athletic footwear. The remaining revenues are derived from various items including furni-
               ture and other items not directly used in sports or physical activity.

               Omnichannel Strategy
               Dick’s mission statement mentions its omnichannel strategy discussed. The term is simply a
               fancy way of stating the company sells its products through its website and through brick-and-
               mortar stores and has exposure to social media. Omnichannel strategies require that firms ensure
               they have excellent inventory tracking systems in place, ensure products are well described on-
               line rather than simply having a picture, use advanced data analytics to predict customer habits
               and desires, and finally ensure an efficient supply chain.
                    Online sporting goods sales are increasing rapidly, up 15 percent in 2017 by some accounts
               to over $400 billion in the U.S. alone. A recent study reported that 33 percent of men and
               25 percent of women indicated they are considering purchasing their sporting goods and apparel
               exclusively online. In total, online purchases of sporting related goods is expected to increase
               7 percent per year through 2021. Customers are increasingly using the internet to research prod-
               ucts as well, not always purchasing online.
                    Dick’s partly relies on customers researching products on their website then coming into
               their stores to talk to sales staff and hopefully purchase the item. Firms like Amazon, who are
               still predominantly online, have the distinct advantage over firms with brick-and-mortar loca-
               tions in being able to operate at higher margins and charge lower prices. Retail stores such as
               Dick’s, though, have the buffer in that many of their products customers want to try on before
               they buy including shoes, apparel, baseball gloves, bats, golf clubs, and even test out exercise
               equipment and bicycles, so maintaining an omnichannel strategy is vital for such retailers.

               Shift to Markets Outside the United States
               Although Dick’s is located 100 percent within the United States, many retailers are pushing their
               products and markets overseas as a growing middle class is developing in many emerging mar-
               kets. Amazon for example earns over one-third of its revenues from outside the United States,
               and even legacy firms such as Staples, earn about 20 percent of its revenues from outside the U.S.
               However, despite robust sales from overseas markets, profit margins are generally significantly
               higher in the United States, and many firms struggle to turn a profit in their overseas operations.

               Inventory Management Strategies
               As discussed, is the need to operate under an omnichannel strategy, inventory management
               is a key element to being successful in retail. Why do people enter a Dick’s Sporting Goods
               store, a Bass Pro Shops, or an antique shop? Why not simply buy online? The answer is rather
               simple—people simply enjoy seeing, holding, sitting in, and playing with the inventory. Some
               analysts even consider displaying the appropriate inventory at the right time is the Holy Grail for
               any retail business—more important than buildings, equipment, and even location. Being able to
               lure customers into the store to see new, exciting inventory first-hand is becoming increasingly

                                   important to compete with the Amazons and eBays of the world, where customers simply pur-
                                   chase with the click of a button or a tap on their smart phone screen.
                                       To ensure the proper inventory is available, many firms are adopting so called quick response
                                   (QR) systems that order a replacement item as soon as one is purchased. Stores like Dick’s must
                                   be cognizant, however, of the risk of simply becoming a showroom for inventory with customers
                                   leaving to purchase the very products they played with online at a cheaper price. Having the cor-
                                   rect inventory may be the most important factor for attracting customers into your store, but how
                                   do you increase the odds for a sale? See the next section.

                                   Store-in-a-Store and Employees’ Strategies
                                   A way to increase the odds of customers actually making a purchase while in the store is through
                                   having a highly trained staff. Staffing the store with knowledgeable personnel is a key element to
                                   closing a sale. Dick’s, for example, has extremely knowledgeable employees working through-
                                   out the store. Similarly, ULTA, formally known as ULTA Beauty, also has knowledgeable per-
                                   sonnel selling its products and even has a beauty parlor store-in-a-store concept which forces
                                   customers coming to have their hair done to walk through the store. Bass Pro Shops employees,
                                   in fishing, hunting, or hiking sections, for example, can talk educationally about the products. In
                                   essence, some retail stores are not even selling inventory, rather selling information—as opposed
                                   to Walmart who simply competes on bottom of the line price. There are not many Walmarts
                                   in the country where you can receive detailed fishing tips and information from the personnel
                                   working sporting goods or what type wax is best for your vehicle from the people working in the
                                   automobile section. Walmart is not in the information business; they compete on cost.

                                   Customer Loyalty Strategies
                                   Much of the above discussion is around building customer loyalty, but a few additional consid-
                                   erations are included in this section. Unlike a giant department store that sells everything under
                                   the sun, specialty retailers have a narrower range of customers. In many ways, they operate
                                   under what Porter would call a focused strategy. As a result, specialty retailers must keep their
                                   core customers happy and returning because this core group is predominantly the only custom-
                                   ers the firm has, as opposed to Walmart, who has many customers buying anything from food
                                   to socks—the penalty on faltering on one product category is not as severe. Tactics used to
                                   foster customer loyalty include increased marketing, reward cards, private label credit cards,
                                   and creating your own private label brands, which often are sold at higher margins for the firm
                                   and cheaper prices for the customer. Another advantage of private label brands is customers
                                   are not able to compare prices as easily because the store is the only source for that particular
                                   product. Dick’s peer and foe, Bass Pro Shops, has done a phenomenal job with its Johnny Morris
                                   (the firm’s founder) brand of fishing rods and reels and other items using Morris’ namesake.
                                   The only place to purchase is at Bass Pro shops, not Amazon, not ebay, only Bass Pro. To the
                                   degree a firm can market effectively and hire the proper personnel to endorse store branded
                                   items combined with possibly offering double rewards when purchasing store branded items,
                                   significant brand loyalty can be built.

                                   Future
                                   The United States has an extremely high rate of diabetes and hypertension, and by some
                                   estimates, the highest rate of obesity among developed countries—34 percent of men and
                                   37 percent of women classified as obese. The U.S. government has introduced several programs
                                   aimed at increasing physical activity of its citizens and even promoted them through key figures,
                                   including former first lady Michelle Obama. Nike, and other firms, are also encouraging and
                                   marketing in a manner to get people more active.
                                       With a growing health-minded segment of the population, increased pressure is being placed
                                   on others to conform, which should bode well for Dick’s Sporting Goods. However, smartphones
                                   and laptop video games and the like have overall curtailed the prevalence of outdoor activities.
                                   Too many young people are hooked on online games and social media communications—to the
                                   detriment of firms like Dick’s that want to get you out in the field, in the woods, on the court, or
                                   on the water.
                                       Dick’s needs a clear strategic plan going forward to obtain and nurture a loyal customer base.

               11 Bit Studios S.A.—2022

               www.11bitstudios.com
               Headquartered in Warsaw, Poland, 11 Bit Studios (11 Bit) is a large video game development
               and publishing company with sales derived globally. Founded in 2010, 11 Bit has made a name
               for itself developing such games as Anomaly: Warzone Earth (2011), This War of Mine (2014),
               Moonlighter (2018), and Frostpunk (2018). The company has also released Children of Morta
               (2019). 11 Bit’s Chinese partner, NetEase, is working on the mobile version of Frostpunk, while
               its board game version is being produced by Glass Cannon Unplugged. 11 Bit is a successful,
               growing company with space for more than 300 employees at its headquarters in Warsaw; as of
               year-end 2021, the company has about 200 employees.
                   For 2020, 11 Bit reported revenue of PLN 87.1 million, up 22.3 percent from the prior year,
               while the company’s operating profit was PLN 40.79 million, up 57.6 percent from 2019. The
               firm’s net profit for 2020 was PLN 37.36 million, up 57.5 percent from the prior year. The com-
               pany’s available cash at year-end 2020 was PLN 96.13 million, up 16.9 percent and the high-
               est level ever. Thus, this company is doing really well financially. However, the pandemic has
               impacted the gaming industry in interesting ways. Lockdowns have increased game sales, but
               development has taken a major hit: studios were forced to adapt to varied seating arrangements,
               and many new releases had to be delayed, inflating production costs on both counts. Thus, a
               revenue spike in 2020 doesn’t necessarily mean stellar performance.

               History
               Founded in December 2009, 11 Bit’s stock was listed on the Warsaw Stock Exchange in December
               2015. This company handles every stage of the video game creation process, from idea concep-
               tion and software creation to production and marketing globally. Gaming titles are usually sold
               through a third-party platform like Steam or Epic Games Store on the PC and through official
               stores on the consoles.
                   In 2010, 11 Bit released Anomaly, which quickly became one of the world’s most popular
               “tower offense” games. The company’s This War of Mine (TWoM) was released in 2014 (PC ver-
               sion) and within weeks occupied top positions on the bestseller lists of Steam and other digital
               distribution platforms. TWoM was soon adapted to new hardware platforms and new language
               versions, and it remained a key contributor to 11 Bit’s financial performance in 2014–2017.
               TWoM was replaced as 11 Bit’s main revenue source by Frostpunk, which debuted (PC ver-
               sion) in April 2018. Within 3 days of its release, customers purchased over 250,000 copies of
               Frostpunk, which more than covered its production costs.
                   In 2017, 11 Bit’s publishing division released two games: Beat Cop and Tower 57;
               Moonlighter followed in 2018. These 3 products increased the percentage of revenues contrib-
               uted by the publishing division from 12 percent to 18 percent. In 2019, this percentage increased
               to 40 percent following release of another third-party developed title, Children of Morta, whose
               PC and console versions were released in Fall 2019. In 2020, the percentage of 11 Bit’s total
               revenue derived from the sale of third-party developed games (the publishing segment) was 29
               percent.
                   For Q1 of 2021, 11 Bit again reported excellent financial results, including more than PLN
               14.83 million in revenue, PLN 6.38 million in EBITDA, PLN 3.56 million in net profit, and nearly
               PLN 107.8 million in liquid assets. These numbers exceeded even the company’s expectations.

               Vision/Mission
               Note that 11 Bit isn’t even the most prominent publisher in Poland (that honor probably goes
               to CD Projekt). Companies such as Valve, Ubisoft, etc. are much larger players in this industry
               globally. This should be kept in mind when thinking about the vision and mission statements.

    434    STRATEGIC-MANAGEMENT CASE ANALYSIS

                                      11 Bit does not have a formal vision statement on its website or in its Annual Report, but the
                                   company’s mission statement is stated to be two words: “Meaningful Entertainment.”
                                      A possible vision statement for 11 Bit could read something like this: to become the most
                                   renowned video game producer and marketer in Europe.

                                   By-Segment Information
                                   11 Bit operates under two segments or divisions: 1) Game Development, which entails de-
                                   veloping, producing, marketing, distributing, and enhancing video games internally, and 2)
                                   Publishing, which entails acquiring, marketing, and distributing video games developed by third-
                                   party companies.

                                   Game Development
                                   11 Bit has established three internal development teams consisting of about 70 persons each.
                                   The company’s internal operations include all aspects of the creative process (concept, design,
                                   art, programming, quality assurance, cross-platform development, and customer support). Video
                                   games included in 11 Bit’s Game Development segment include This War of Mine (TWoM),
                                   Frostpunk, and Project 8. From its debut in Fall 2014 to the end of 2020, This War of Mine game
                                   generated total revenue of more than PLN 110 million for 11 Bit.
                                        Frostpunk is a video game that tells the story of the struggle for survival of a commu-
                                   nity stranded in a freezing world. Revenue from Frostpunk in 2020 totaled more than PLN
                                   130 ­million. In 2021, Frostpunk was made available for mobile devices running iOS and Android
                                   and had a F2P (free-2-play) model. For 11 Bit to build Frostpunk into a cross-platform global
                                   brand was a big step. Frostpunk for mobile devices was developed by China-based NetEase, a
                                   gaming industry giant with a very strong position in the mobile games sector.
                                        At the time of writing, Project 8 is the code name for 11 Bit’s newest, still secret video
                                   game. A team of more than fifty 11 Bit employees are working on Project 8, compared to the
                                   team of 65 persons that produced Frostpunk. Analysts expect that Project 8 will be released si-
                                   multaneously for the PC and for consoles. 11 Bit recently changed Project 8’s game engine from
                                   the proprietary (internal) solution on which the company’s earlier games had run to the Unreal
                                   Engine.

                                   Publishing
                                   11 Bit’s revenue from sales of video games in its Publishing segment in 2020 accounted for 29
                                   percent of total revenue, down from 40 percent the prior year. Prominent video games included
                                   in 11 Bit’s Game Development segment include Beat Cop, Tower 57, Moonlighter, Children of
                                   Morta, Vitriol, Foxhole, Botin, and Ava.
                                       Developed by Spanish studio Digital Sun but published by 11 Bit, Moonlighter was released
                                   in mid-2018 for the PC, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch, and PS4. Through 2020, 11 Bit derived
                                   revenue of over PLN 44 million from Moonlighter with the Nintendo Switch as the primary
                                   sales platform. This game is available from the world’s leading digital gaming platforms, in-
                                   cluding Steam. A version for Apple smartphones was launched in November 2020. Preparations
                                   are under way to release Moonlighter for Android devices. By the end of December 2020, 11
                                   Bit’s revenue from Moonlighter and its add-ons for all hardware platforms was more than PLN
                                   44 million.
                                       Produced by the American studio Dead Mage, Children of Morta was released in Fall 2019
                                   for the PC, Xbox One, PS4, and Nintendo Switch. Children of Morta is an action-RPG and
                                   ranked among top ten of the Steam’s bestsellers. In August 2020, 11 Bit released downloadable
                                   content (DLC) named Children of Morta: Paws and Claws, which introduced animal charac-
                                   ters in the game. All proceeds from the sale of the DLC are being donated by 11 Bit to The
                                   Humane Society International Foundation. As of year-end 2020, 11 Bit derived total revenue
                                   from Children of Morta of PLN 24 million.
                                       At year-end 2020, 11 Bit has four titles being developed under its Publishing division. The first
                                   is codenamed Vitriol and under development by Fool’s Theory Studio, based in Bielsko-Biała. The
                                   second and third are codenamed Foxhole and Botin and are being produced by Digital Sun. The
                                   fourth is a game codenamed Ava, under development by Spanish development studio Chibig. 11
                                   Bit’s total investment in these four games as of year-end 2020 is about PLN 20 million, compared
                                   to a total investment in Moonlighter and Children of Morta of about PLN 5 million.

               By-Region Segments
               Like most game publishers, 11 Bit competes globally, not just in its home country of Poland.
               In 2020, foreign sales (outside Poland) accounted for 97.6 percent of the 11 Bit’s total revenue,
               down slightly from 97.9 percent the prior year. 11 Bit does business in six geographical areas, as
               indicated in Exhibit 1. Note that the lion’s share of the company’s revenues are generated from
               the United States, followed by Japan, and then the European Union. Note the decreasing 11 Bit
               revenues in 2020 from the European Union, China, and the “Other” category.

               Internal Issues
               Objectives
               11 Bit’s objectives, dispersed across the company’s 2020 Annual Report, include the following:
                   1. Employ about 200 employees by the end of 2021
                   2. Increase production budgets on its own IP and third-party IP titles
                   3. Release one premiere game per year for its own IP titles
                   4. Publish 3–4 third-party IP titles each year
                   5. Release increasingly complex and higher-priced games. (Note: The development and production
                      costs of a single video game may exceed PLN 5.5 million.)
                   6. Grow much faster than the entire video games market and steadily increase its market share.

               Marketing
               For marketing, 11 Bit relies almost exclusively on third-party companies to sell its products.
               This is standard for most independent game companies; it’s a select few firms that can sell by
               themselves.
                   The firm’s revenue from sales of video games was PLN 87 million in 2020, with PLN
               86 ­million coming from sales of the company’s products through Valve Corporation’s Steam,
               Nintendo Co. Ltd, Microsoft Corporation, Google, Apple, Sony, and Humble Bundle—the
               world’s leading electronic distribution platforms. In 2020, the company’s largest distributors
               were Value Corporation, Humble Bundle., Nintendo Co Ltd., Google LLC, GOG Sp. z.o.o, and
               Sony Interactive Entertainment America LLC. Receivables from those firms ranged from 3.66
               million PLN from Valve to 0.577 million PLN from Sony.

               Organizational Structure
               Przemysław Marszał is currently the CEO of 11 Bit and Grzegorz Miechowski is the COO of
               the company. However, beyond these two persons, the company’s website and its 2020 Annual
               Report offer no information about who reports to who or who is responsible for what. Some ana-
               lysts would suggest that 11 Bit is sufficiently large to function with a divisional-by-region type
               of structure, with divisional head persons carrying the title President. In other words, this firm
               likely needs to be less centralized in its overall design and chain-of-command.

               External Issues
               Consumers globally are spending more and more time in front of their computers, smartphones,
               consoles, PCs, laptops, and tablets. Thus, the outlook for the video game industry in the coming
               years is outstanding, with the mobile games segment growing fastest of all.

               Regional Information
               For more than a decade, video games have been the fastest-growing segment of the entertainment
               industry. In fact, the value of the video gaming market already exceeds that of the film and music
               markets combined. Newzoo, a Dutch provider of games analytics, reports that the global video
               games market in 2019 was valued at $152.1 billion, an increase of 9.6 percent compared with the
               prior year. Newzoo’s 2020 growth forecasts were for the gaming market to increase by another
               9.3 percent to $159.3 billion (an all-time record).
                   Exhibit 4 provides information related to regional growth in the global video games market.
               Note that the Middle East & Africa market grew 30.2 percent in 2020 to $6.2 billion.

               prior year, to $174.9 billion. The firm also reports that in geographical terms, Asia, especially

                                   $84.3 billion on computer games, a 17 percent increase over 2019. However, in 2020, the Asian
                                   market accounted for about 48 percent of the global gaming market, down 1 percent from the
                                   prior year.
                                        Some analysts report that rates of growth in the European and American gaming markets in
                                   2020 were markedly higher than in Asia. Newzoo too reported that Americans spent $44.7 ­billion
                                   on video games in 2020, up 21.4 percent from the prior year and comprising 26 percent of global
                                   spending on this type of entertainment. Moreover, according to Newzoo, European spending on
                                   video games reached $32.9 billion in 2020, up 19.9 percent, and comprising a 19 percent share
                                   of the global gaming market.
                                        Latin America loves video games even more than Asia, as spending there increased 25.2
                                   percent in 2020 to $6.8 billion, comprising 4 percent of the global market. Based on spending,
                                   in 2020, Africa and the Middle East comprised 3 percent of the global gaming market, or $6.2
                                   billion, up 30 percent year-over-year.
                                        Although the market for video games in 11 Bit’s home country of Poland represents an al-
                                   most negligible share of the global gaming market at about 0.4 percent, a report titled “Condition
                                   of the Polish Gaming Industry 2020” states that in 2020 the value of the Polish gaming market
                                   was PLN 2.43 billion, compared with PLN 2.23 billion the prior year. This report estimates that
                                   the video games market in Poland will be worth PLN 2.54 billion in 2021 and grow to PLN 2.69
                                   billion in 2022, and then to PLN 3 billion by 2024.

                                   Video games can be played on different kinds of devices, and producers of video games spend

                                       Newzoo reported that in 2020 smartphone owners spent $86.3 billion on video games, up a
                                   whopping 25.6 percent from the prior year, comprising 49 percent of the device-playing video
                                   game market. Video games dedicated for play on smartphones are often sold at low prices or
                                   even offered in the F2P (free-to-play) model.
                                       Behind smartphones in revenue are video games for consoles, at $51.2 billion in 2020, up 21
                                   percent from the prior year, and comprising 29 percent of the global gaming market. However,
                                   Newzoo reports that projections for video game spending on PCs in 2020 grew only 6.2 percent
                                   and comprised just $37.4 billion. The PC share in the global video gaming market in 2020 de-
                                   clined 22 percent, partly due to a further decline in the share of web browser games (titles avail-
                                   able via social media, for example). The PC segment of the video game market now comprises
                                   only 2 percent of the global gaming market.
                                       Video games for handheld devices will play an increasing role in the future due to a rapid rise
                                   in the number of such devices globally. This growth will come at the expense of the PC and web
                                   browser games segments. Console games are set to retain their market position, although sales of
                                   the new generation Sony and Microsoft consoles are picking up rather slowly. The market share
                                   of games dedicated to tablet computers is expected to remain unchanged from its current level
                                   of a few percent.

               Major Industry Players
               The industry includes both big-budget developers and publishers of so-called AAA games and
               smaller firms that specialize in low-budget “indie” games. The former includes studios like
               Rockstar Games, Bioware, Blizzard, and Bethesda; the latter includes Chucklefish, Digital
               Devolver, and Annapurna Interactive. 11 Bit Studios arguably sits closer to the indie end of the
               spectrum, but this section will discuss the most prominent names in the video game industry to
               present a broad view of the gaming landscape.
                   Headquartered in Kyoto, Japan, Nintendo was arguably the first video game development
               company—its first product was introduced in 1979. Nintendo is the world’s largest video game
               company by revenue, with a net value of over $150 billion. Some of Nintendo’s notable video
               franchises are Mario, Pokémon, and The Legend of Zelda.
                   Headquartered in Bellevue, Washington, and with a key subsidiary in Luxembourg, Value
               Corporation has total equity of over $5 billion, though most of this is from Steam, its online
               games marketplace. Some of the company’s most popular games include the Portal, Team
               Fortress, and Half-Life series.
                   Headquartered in New York City and owned by Take-Two Interactive, Rockstar Games was
               founded in 1998 by Sam House, Dan Houser, Terry Donovan, Jamie King, and Gary Foreman.
               Its many popular video games series include Grand Theft Auto and Red Dead Redemption.
                   Headquartered in Redwood City, California, Electronic Arts (EA) is a video game develop-
               ment and publishing company with annual revenue over $8 billion. Some of its popular video
               games are the Battlefield and FIFA series as well as several games in the Star Wars franchise.
                   Headquartered in Santa Monica, California, Activision Blizzard is a NASDAQ-listed holding
               company that owns and operates subsidiaries that have developed bestselling videogames such as
               the Call of Duty series, World of Warcraft, Overwatch, and the Tony Hawks series.
                   Headquartered in Minato, Tokyo, Japan, Sony Computer Entertainment is a wholly owned
               subsidiary of the Sony Corporation. Sony produces the PlayStation series of gaming consoles,
               one of the biggest gaming platforms around the world. This video game company has several
               subsidiaries in Asia, Europe, and North America.
                   Headquartered in Montreuil, France, Ubisoft is a video game developer and publisher that
               has subsidiaries in 26 countries throughout the world and trades on Euronex as UBI. Some of its
               popular video games include the Assassin’s Creed, Far Cry, and Tom Clancy series.
                   Sega Games Co. Ltd. is headquartered in Tokyo, Japan, and is a wholly owned subsidiary of
               the larger Sega Holdings. Sega Games has several offices around the world. Some of the best-

                                             Conclusion
                                             11 Bit’s forthcoming Project 8 game is based on the Unreal Engine, not a self-developed one.
                                             In fact, on February 23, 2021, 11 Bit announced that the company is discontinuing further work
                                             on its own engine, which means that new productions of 11 Bit games will be based solely on
                                             third-party solutions.
                                                 In addition to Project 8, 11 Bit is engaged in prototype work on a game with the code name
                                             Dolly Project (formerly Project 9) and a game code-named Eleanor Project (formerly Project 10).
                                             The company’s strategy for the next few years is to have three in-house development teams that
                                             are comparable in size (about 60–70 people each). Given an average production cycle of about 3–4
                                             years for each game, with three teams, 11 Bit desires to release one proprietary title a year.

                   11 Bit is regularly updating and improving its existing games and developing DLCs to spur
               revenues. In June 2020, 11 Bit announced Chinese NetEase would create a new version of
               Frostpunk for mobile devices, so the game will soon be offered with the F2P model.
                   11 Bit anticipates that its publishing division will become an increasingly important con-
               tributor to company revenues and profits. In 2021 and beyond, revenue delivered by the publish-
               ing division from third-party developed titles will mainly include revenue from Moonlighter and
               Children of Morta, as DLCs and new platform versions are under development, such as for iOS
               and Android mobile devices.
                   11 Bit’s previous strategy for the publishing segment had assumed that a single project would
               not consume more than PLN 2 million, but that cap has since increased to PLN 5 million. Now,
               11 Bit wants to launch third-party developed games every quarter. At year-end 2020, 11 Bit had
               four publishing agreements with third-party development teams.
                   11 Bit needs a clear strategic plan to guide its top management decisions in the coming
               months and years. Recall from the case that the company desires to strengthen its affiliations
               with third-party video game developers. If your strategic analysis supports this strategy, where
               and how should the company do this? Note also that the company’s organizational structure is
               not clear, despite the fast pace with which the firm continues to grow. Would a divisional struc-
               ture by product, region, customer, or device be effective, and why? Develop projected financial
               statements for 11 Bit to reveal the expected impact of your recommendations on the company’s
               finances.

                                   JPMorgan & Chase Co.—2018

                                   www.jpmorgan.com, JPM
                                   Headquartered in New York City, JPMorgan Chase (JPM) is one of the oldest financial institu-
                                   tions in the world. JPM is the world’s sixth largest bank by total assets of over $2.6 trillion, and
                                   the second most valuable bank based in market capitalization. JPM offers services in investment
                                   banking, financial services for consumers and small businesses, commercial banking, financial
                                   transaction processing, and asset management. JPM has over 240,000 employees, with op-
                                   erations in 60 countries worldwide. Based on total assets, JPM ranks first in banking industry
                                   market share with about 14 percent, and second in total domestic deposits of about $1.8 billion.
                                   JPM’s revenues have increased every year to almost $100 billion in 2017. JPM’s stock is one of
                                   the 30 components of the Dow Jones Industrial Average. The hedge fund unit of JPM is one of
                                   the largest hedge funds in the United States.
                                       JPM operates under two principle brands, 1) JPMorgan and 2) Chase. The JPMorgan brand focuses
                                   on large multinational corporations, governments, wealthy individuals, and institutional investors. The
                                   Chase brand is further divided into two distinct segments: 1) consumer business and 2) commercial
                                   banking business. The Chase consumer business includes such businesses as traditional bank branches,
                                   ATMs, credit cards, home finance, retirement, investing, and merchant services, among others. The
                                   Chase commercial banking business includes such areas as business credit, corporate client banking,
                                   commercial term lending, and community development. The two JPM brands overlap so much in
                                   terms of regions and products that the company does not report revenues/income by the two brands.

                                   History
                                   Dating back to 1799, JPM is one of the oldest financial institutions in the world. The heritage of
                                   the House of Morgan traces its roots to the partnership of Drexel, Morgan & Co., which in 1895
                                   was renamed JPMorgan & Co. Arguably the most influential financial institution of its era, JPM
                                   financed the formation of the United States Steel Corporation, which took over the business of
                                   Andrew Carnegie and others and was the world’s first billion-dollar corporation. In 1895, JPM
                                   supplied the United States government with $62 million in gold to float a bond issue and restore
                                   the treasury surplus of $100 million. In 1892, the company began to finance the New York, New
                                   Haven, and Hartford Railroad and led it through a series of acquisitions that made it the domi-
                                   nant railroad transporter in New England.
                                       In 2004, JPM merged with Chicago-based Bank One Corp., bringing on board current chair-
                                   man and CEO Jamie Dimon as president and COO, and designating him as former CEO William
                                   Harrison, Jr.’s successor. Dimon’s pay was pegged at 90 percent of Harrison’s. Dimon quickly
                                   made his influence felt by embarking on a cost-cutting strategy, and replaced former JPM execu-
                                   tives in key positions with Bank One executives—many of whom were with Dimon at Citigroup.
                                   Dimon became CEO and Chairman of JPM in 2006.
                                       JPM has acquired over 1,200 financial institutions over its life. The acquisition responsible
                                   for the current name of the company was in 2000 when J.P. Morgan & Co. merged with The
                                   Chase Manhattan Corp. In 2010, JPM acquired Cazenove, an advisory and underwriting joint
                                   venture established in 2004 in the United Kingdom. Since 2010, JPM has refrained from making
                                   acquisitions that had historically been its trademark.

                                   JPM’s actual vision statement (paraphrased) is as follows: “We strive to be the best financial
                                   services company on the planet.”
                                        JPM’s actual mission statement (paraphrased) is as follows: “We strive to be the worldwide

               Internal Issues
               Organizational Structure
               In January 2018, JPM appointed Daniel Pinto, CEO of its Corporate & Investment Bank, and
               Gordon Smith, CEO of Consumer & Community Banking, co-presidents and co-chief operat-
               ing officers of the company, continuing to report to Jamie Dimon, Chairman and CEO. Perhaps
               those appointments are part of a broader shift within JPM to a strategic business unit (SBU type
               organizational structure whereby numerous by-product or by-region executives report to Pinto
               and Smith).

               Current Strategies
               JPM is utilizing a growth strategy and aggressively buying back stock. In 2017, JPM repurchased
               about $14 billion in treasury stock. JPM is heavily investing in technology, spending nearly $10
               billion on technology in 2016 with $3 billion dedicated solely toward new initiatives, such as
               opening new accounts from a mobile phone, mobile investment advice, and improved ability to
               buy and sell stocks online. JPM invested about $20 billion from the new tax law passed in 2017,
               using much of this money to open 400 new branches across the United States. In February 2018,
               JPM increased wages for retail banking employees (tellers and similar jobs) from an average of
               $14.25 to $16.50 per hour—a 16 percent increase. The company also expanded home lending to
               low- to moderate-income customers from $7.7 billion to $50 billion. JPM plans to increase its
               philanthropic donations by 40 percent to $1.75 billion through 2022.
               Finance
               JPM’s recent income statements and balance sheets are provided in Exhibit 2 and Exhibit 3
               respectively. Note the 4.14 percent increase in revenues in 2017, but the slight decline in net
               income. Also notice in Exhibit 3 that JPM did not sell additional shares of stock in 2017 to raise
               capital, nor did the company increase its long-term debt—so all financing basically came from
               internally generated net income.

               Segment Data
               JPM operates under four main business segments: Consumer & Community Banking, Corporate
               & Investment Banking, Commercial Banking, and Asset & Wealth Management. According to
               Exhibit 4, Consumer & Community Banking reports the largest revenues based on year-end
               2017 data with Corporate & Investment Banking generating the largest profits. Commercial
               Banking has the largest profit margin at 40 percent.
               Consumer & Community Banking
               As the largest division of JPM, Consumer & Community Banking revenues grew from $45 billion
               in 2016 to just over $46 billion in 2017, but net income dropped $300 million to $9.4 billion. The
               division has relationships with almost half the households in the United States, with 70 percent

               of these households using the bank as their primary bank. About 80 percent of Chase households
               with a mortgage initiated the mortgage from another bank, although this number may reduce in the
               future as rates are now rising; there is less of a need for buying out existing mortgages with likely
               lower rates. The division has claims to have the top-rated mobile banking app, ATM network, and
               most visited banking portal in the United States. The division had 26 million active mobile custom-
               ers in 2016, with these customers spending 90 percent more than customers who do not engage in
               digital banking; mobile customers increased 16 percent in 2016 as the firm looks to attract more to
               mobile options. The division also plans to significantly expand its over 5,000 branches by nearly
               10 percent in the coming years. Services provided by the division include: traditional banking,
               business banking, mortgages, credit cards, auto loans, and merchant processing services for busi-
               nesses accepting credit cards. The credit card business at Chase increased new accounts by 20 per-
               cent in 2016, but sales volume only increased 10 percent. This was possibly due to the new Chase
               Freedom Unlimited card and the Amazon Prime card. Chase’s new Sapphire Reserve credit card
               exceeded the annual target of customers in only 2 weeks, but the average customer has a FICO

               mortgages were up 16 and 14 percent, respectively, in 2016, with foreclosures down 36 percent.

               Corporate & Investment Bank
               The Corporate & Investment Bank is the second largest division at JPM with 2017 revenues in
               excess of $34 billion. The division reported record profits of $10.8 billion in 2016, up 34 percent
               from 2015. They did not increase profits in 2017, but maintained profits at $10.8 billion and saw
               revenue drop $700 million. The relatively flat increases in revenues and profits for the division
               is partly explained by the flat year of mergers and acquisitions in 2016, which JPM suggests
               was even lower than 2015. The bank still completed more merger and acquistion (M&A) deals
               in 2016 than any other U.S. bank and was number-two in global deals created. The division
               predicts emerging markets will account for over 70 percent of worldwide GDP growth up from
               40 percent currently. In addition to specializing in M&As, the division is also the leader of debt
               capital for U.S. nonprofits, governments, states, universities, and municipalities—extending $90
               billion to these clients in 2016. The division led over 340 equity underwriting deals for IPOs in
               2016, making it the only global bank to gain market share during this difficult time period.

               Commercial Banking
               Commercial Banking enjoyed record revenue in 2017 of $8.6 billion, up from $7.5 billion in
               2016, accompanied by a record net income of $3.5 billion, up 29 percent from 2016. The divi-
               sion invested more than ever before in 2016 in technology, data, and other key capabilities with
               plans to devote increased capital to wholesale payment platforms, data, and technology moving

                                   forward. The Commercial Banking division has a partnership with the Corporate & Investment
                                   Bank division at JPM, working on various issues together. In 2016, the firms worked to launch
                                   new digital platforms designed to aid small- to medium-sized companies. The division plans to
                                   focus on market penetration by opening offices in eight new markets. The division focuses on
                                   business banking for small- to medium-sized firms, and offers many of the same services as the
                                   Consumer & Community Banking division, rather targeted at businesses.

                                   Asset & Wealth Management
                                   This division enjoyed $900 million in revenue growth in 2017 accounting for a 7.5 percent gain
                                   and profits of $2.3 billion. With direct relationships with 60 percent of the largest pension funds,
                                   wealth funds, and central banks in the world and 50 percent of the wealthiest individuals, the
                                   division is well positioned to serve large customers. However, the Asset & Wealth Management
                                   division also provides advice to over 1 million U.S. families through Chase Wealth Management,
                                   balancing out the division with a wide range of customers in various economic positions. The
                                   division grew its office spending by 14 percent and retained over 95 percent of its top talent.

                                   Competitors
                                   JPM has over 5,000 competitors, ranging from hundreds of small local banks to multinational
                                   peers such as Bank of America and Wells Fargo, that are compared to JPM in Exhibit 5. There is
                                   a notable difference in net incomes and the resulting EPS ratios. JPM has a higher market cap,
                                   more revenue, net income, and a significantly larger EPS than both its top rivals.

                                   Bank of America Corporation (BAC)
                                   Bank of America serves individuals, businesses, institutional investors and large corporations
                                   and governments worldwide on a variety of financial needs. The company traces its roots back
                                   to 1904 and is headquartered in Charlotte, North Carolina. With over 209 thousand employees,
                                   Bank of America reported 2017 revenues in excess of $87 billion. The company operates in over
                                   35 countries and all 50 U.S. states with a footprint that includes 80 percent of the U.S. popula-
                                   tion. Bank of America has over 16,000 ATMs and 34 million accounts with 25 million mobile
                                   users and 5,500 branches.
                                       The company serves over 3 million small business owners and is considered the global leader
                                   in investment banking and trading. By some metrics, Bank of America is the second largest bank
                                   in the United States. The organization is made up of Bank of America, Merrill Lynch, US Trust,
                                   and Bank of America Merrill Lynch and offers eight lines of businesses. These include retail,
                                   preferred and small business, Merrill Lynch Wealth Management, and US Trust for individual
                                   consumers. For companies, they offer businesses in business banking, global commercial bank-
                                   ing, and global corporate and investment banking. For institutional investors, global markets are
                                   provided. Investment management, brokerage, banking, trust, and retirement products are many
                                   of the services that are provided to their customers.

                                   Founded in 1852, Wells Fargo today has assets that total over $1.9 trillion. The company offers
                                   banking, insurance, investments, mortgage, and consumer and commercial financial services.
                                   They provide their 70 million customers with over 8,400 locations, 13,000 ATMs, online and
                                   mobile support. Wells Fargo has 286,000 employees in 42 countries around the world. They rank
                                   third in total deposits, third in total assets, fifth as the biggest public company in the world, and

               has been the number-one largest workplace employee giving campaign in the United States for 8
               consecutive years. They are also considered the number-one retail mortgage lender.
                    One of the largest acquisitions in banking history in 2008 was the Wells Fargo acquisition of
               Wachovia, giving this California-based bank an increased presence on the east coast, much like
               Bank of America’s acquisition of NationsBank.

               External Issues
               Industry Overview
               The banking industry in the last decade has experienced a decline in the number of branch lo-
               cations that each banking organization owns. As indicated in Exhibit 6, the number of commer-
               cial banks with branches in the United States was over 14,000 from 1975 to 1985. This number
               fell to less than 6,000 in 2014 and has since fallen to just over 5,000 in 2017. Single office
               banks declined from 10,000 down to less than 2,000 from 1966 to 2014. The decline has been
               brought upon because of rapid technological advancements. The ease of doing mobile deposits
               and transfers without having to go to a branch has persuaded customers to demand more online
               banking offerings. Many banks now offer more convenient hours to service their customers.
                    The increase in mobile and online banking has brought upon other issues such as cybercrime.
               Cyber criminals today can more easily steal one’s identity and money from a financial institution. This
               has created bigger challenges for banks to come up with better ways of protecting the customers’ money.

               Banking Industry Services Breakdown
               The banking industry is categorized into several distinct areas which mirror the four divisions
               JPM operates under. Top industries within the U.S. banking industry include: Commercial
               Banking, Credit Card Issuing, Investment Banking, Securities Brokering, and Financial
               Planning. The commercial banking industry includes over 5,000 competitors in the U.S alone.
               Annual revenues total over $575 billion with profits of over $120 billion. Growth has been slow
               at around 1 percent but with the widening of the yield curve, growth is expected to increase to
               over 2 percent through 2023. The industry offers real estate loans, deposit services, commercial

                                   loans, credit card loans, and other products. Of the $575 billion in industry revenues, deposits
                                   account for approximately $200 billion and real estate loans account for just over $100 billion of
                                   revenues. Deposits include traditional bank accounts and retirement accounts.
                                       Banks make money on various fees and lending money to others at higher rates than they
                                   are paying the depositor. Income from customer deposits and fees on “everything” are the life-
                                   blood of the overall banking industry. This industry most closely aligns with JPM’s Consumer &
                                   Community Banking Division.
                                       JPM is active in the credit card business, issuing new cards in 2016 including the Chase
                                   Sapphire Reserve and Chase Freedom cards. The credit card business has grown around 1.5 per-
                                   cent recently with annual growth nearing 3 percent through 2013, as forecasted. Only 7 percent
                                   of profits in this industry are derived from fees charged to the cardholder including: annual fees,
                                   late payment fees, non-usage fees, and other fees. With increased competition, charging annual
                                   fees may become a revenue stream of the past moving forward. Far and away the largest seg-
                                   ment of income for credit card firms is interest income, accounting for around 60 percent of all
                                   income. The remaining balance of 33 percent is mostly derived from fees charged to merchants
                                   when customers use their card. There is increased competition among credit card issuers to at-
                                   tract new customers with cards that return increased points or bonuses for spending, which in
                                   turn have higher fees on the merchant that are in excess of the points provided to the buyer. For
                                   now, this strategy has worked well for banks, but large merchants such as Walmart and other ma-
                                   jor players have tremendous bargaining power, and can even create their own cards and possibly
                                   even become a “bank” themselves if credit card fees become too high. For example, in 2018,
                                   Starbucks and Chase released a new Starbucks Visa Card. But for now, firms like JPM continue
                                   to offer cards with attractive rewards as a means to attract customers and increase their revenues
                                   from fees charged to merchants.
                                       The investment banking and securities business in the United States is a $130 billion industry
                                   with profits of $38 billion and growth through 2023 expected around 2.8 percent. Underwriting
                                   services on both debt and equity account for 35 percent of industry revenues. The large invest-
                                   ment banks often serve as middlemen for firms looking to raise capital through both mediums.
                                   Advising fees for direction on mergers, divestitures, restructurings, and other such activities
                                   account for 22 percent of revenues, along with trading related services also accounting for 22
                                   percent of industry revenues. Trading services include fixed income services, futures exchanges,
                                   stock trading, and other activities generally for large volume clients. JPM has a few different com-
                                   petitors in this industry along with Bank of America, Morgan Stanley, Citigroup, and Goldman
                                   Sachs; all are large competitors with market shares between 9 and 11 percent. JPM is the market

                                   Increased Consolidation
                                   Between 2015 and the middle of 2017, 23 bank mergers in the United States were announced
                                   accounting for $300 billion in assets, with 10 of these deals announced in the first half of 2017.
                                   Banks are not simply buying smaller local banks, but increasingly are looking to purchase online
                                   banks. JPM lost a bidding war with Vantiv to acquire Worldpay for $10 billion. Much of the ac-
                                   quisition activity is expected to be among mid to smaller banks moving forward, as the top four
                                   banks in the United States are near the FDIC deposit limits. This however, will not seriously im-
                                   pact the four largest banks from acquiring other financial players who offer services not directly

                                   Regulations
                                   Following the 2007 to 2009 financial crisis, in 2010, then president Obama signed the Dodd-
                                   Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act that affects all aspects of the financial
                                   industry. Provisions include: prohibition of proprietary trading, restrictions on who can own
                                   hedge funds, establishing the Financial Stability Oversight Council, elimination of the Office
                                   of Thrift Supervision, and much more. The new regulations are expected to greatly increase the
                                   fees all financial institutions must pay. Provisions of Dodd-Frank aim to avoid situations where
                                   large banks (such as AIG and Citigroup) are bailed out by the government because they are “too

               fact apply to middle-sized firms. However, recent research reveals that the largest institutions are
               so interconnected worldwide that, should a similar financial situation arise again, world govern-

                   There is increased hope today within the banking industry that President Trump will increas-
               ingly deregulate the industry in hopes of accelerating growth. As of early 2018, no major dereg-
               ulation changes have been enacted, however, Treasury Secretary Mnuchin and Federal Reserve
               Chair Janet Yellen support adjustments to many of the current regulations placed on banks.
               Key regulators of banks include the Federal Reserve System (Fed), Federal Deposit Insurance
               Corp. (FDIC), Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), Consumer Financial Protection
               Bureau (CFPB), and state regulatory agencies.

               Annual Stress Test
               Large banks in the United States are subject to an annual stress test performed by the Federal
               Reserve System to ensure banks are able to better handle adverse market conditions, such as the
               ones experienced during the recession in 2009. The shakedown includes probing dividend pay-
               ments, lending activities, and stock repurchases. In 2016, all 34 banks under the stress test pro-
               tocol passed the test, hopefully ensuring they are able to lend and operate even during a global
               recession. A side benefit from the recent passing of all 34 banks, the Fed has allowed banks to
               increase their dividends and repurchase shares.

               Future
               As Wells Fargo stumbles, JPM is capitalizing on their rival’s weakness. For Q1 2018, JPM re-
               ported net revenue of $28.52 billion, up from $25.754 billion in Q1 2017; JPM’s Q1 2018 net
               income was $8.712 billion, up from $6.448 billion in Q1 2017. Also for Q1 2018, JPM reported
               that their client investment assets of $276 billion were up 13 percent from the prior quarter,
               while the company’s credit card sales volume increased 12 percent and credit card merchant
               processing volume increased 15 percent.
                    A recent Wall Street Journal article (February 28, 2018, p. B14) revealed that JPM plans to open
               400 new bank branches over the coming 5 years, while entering 15 to 20 new markets (cities). For
               all of 2017, JPM increased its commercial and industrial loan balances by 8 percent, compared to
               1 percent growth for all commercial banks. Marianne Lake, JPM’s CFO, says the company will
               keep buying back its own stock, even though the stock price increased 31 percent in 2017, com-
               pared to a 20 percent increase for all Nasdaq banks.
                    Both JPM and Bank of America believe that to bring in disgruntled Wells Fargo custom-
               ers the companies needs new branch offices. JPM already has branches in 23 states, but lacks
               branches in some key areas such as Philadelphia, Boston, and Washington, D.C. Similarly,
               Bank of America is opening more than 500 branches between 2018 and 2021, led by substantial
               growth in Cincinnati, Cleveland, and Columbus, Ohio. Both JPM and BOA are also closing
               branches in some areas, so the net effect of new brick-and-mortar branches will likely stay even
               for each company over the next few years.
                    JPM needs a clear strategic plan to maintain, and hopefully improve, its excellent financial
               performance as reported in 2017.

                                   www.ppbgroup.com
                                   Headquartered in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, PPB Group Berhad (PPB) is a conglomerate with
                                   a wide range of businesses that includes food production, agriculture, waste management, and
                                   movie cinemas. FFM owns and operates the largest flour milling business in Malaysia and has
                                   a total milling capacity of 2,550 megatons daily. Flour and animal feed–milling is PPB’s largest
                                   revenue generating segment and includes FFM Berhad, an 80-percent-owned subsidiary of PPB.
                                   FFM is also a large animal-feed supplier in Malaysia and operates mills in Vietnam, Thailand,
                                   and China.
                                       Another subsidiary of PPB is Golden Screen Cinemas (GSC), the largest cinema chain in
                                   Malaysia and a distributor of Chinese, English, and various foreign-language films to cinemas
                                   and television channels in the region. Another subsidiary still, Chemquest, provides water treat-
                                   ment and waste-management solutions for cities and communities in Malaysia. PPB is also in the
                                   property management and investment business through its subsidiary Hartabina, which owns and
                                   manages the Cheras Leisure Mall and Ceras Plaza in Cheras and the New World Park in Penang.
                                   Through Hartabina, PPB is also involved in developing Puteri Harbour and Iskandar Malaysia.
                                   PPB also owns about 20 percent of Wilmar International, a Singapore-based company that is the
                                   largest palm-oil trader in the world.
                                       Having diversified operations throughout Southeast Asia, PPB needs a clear strategic plan
                                   for the best allocation of its available resources across its numerous endeavors, products, and
                                   regions.

                                   History
                                   PPB was founded in 1968 in the northern Malaysian state of Perlis as Perlis Plantations Berhad
                                   (hence the derivation of its current name) by Robert Kuok, who wanted to cultivate and mill sug-
                                   arcane. A closer precursor to PPB was the rice wholesaler business Robert Kuok and his brother
                                   Phillip opened in Malaysia in 1948, after which they soon began acquiring sugar plantations. The
                                   two brothers then founded Federal Flour Mills (FFM). By the end of the 1960s, the Kuok broth-
                                   ers controlled an estimated 10 percent of the world’s sugar supply, earning them the nickname
                                   “the Sugar Kings.” In 1972, PPB went public and initiated substantial business in Singapore.
                                   PPB divested its sugar business in 2009. Today, PPB is highly diversified, but its main business
                                   is to supply flour to downstream food-producers primarily through FFM. The Kuok family in
                                   Malaysia retains control of the company with a 50.8 percent shareholding.

                                   Vision and Mission
                                   PPB’s vision and mission statements are overly broad and leave the reader with little knowledge
                                   of the firm’s business. The firm may be better off with a clear focus from both the vision and
                                   mission to guide its business operations. The vision and mission statements can be viewed in the
                                   annual report available at the company’s website, in the “Financial Performance” section: www.

                                   Mission Statement
                                   The PPB mission statement, given on the corporate website, lists three objectives, which are to
                                   be achieved with social and environmental responsibility: reinforcement of its leadership posi-
                                   tion in Malaysia, regional expansion, and investment in activities that facilitate these goals.

               Internal Issues
               Organizational Structure
               PPB appears to function with a centralized organizational design as their 2020 Annual Report
               does not list presidents of segments as being top executives. The top executives of PPB are listed
               and arrayed in Exhibit 1:

               Source: Based on information in PPB’s 2020 Annual Report, pp. 67–70.


                   Some analysts would content that PPB should revise its organizational structure to become
               more decentralized, thereby delegating more effective accountability and responsibility for each
               segment to a president of those operations. An alternative design would be divisional-by-­region,
               but this would likely necessitate too much varied competencies across too many products.
               However, a structure based on strategic business units (SBUs) could serve the company well
               moving forward.

               Finance
               Exhibit 2 reveals the income statements for PPB (RM stands for ringgit Malaysia; ringgit is the
               Malaysian currency). Note a large drop in revenues—blamed mostly on the closure of many the-
               ater businesses during 2020—but a large increase in net income during 2020. It is interesting to
               note that the revenues provided align closely with the business segments of Grains & Agribusiness,
               Consumer Products, Film Exhibition & Distribution, and Environmental Engineering & Utilities
               and Property. However, the corresponding net income derived from these segments does not
               match the reported net income on the income statements. According to the Annual Report, PPB
               has many subsidiaries located in China that focus on Grains & Agribusiness, and it is possible
               that the net income from these businesses is reflected in the line item non-recurring events.
               However, in the case of PPB, these events can be expected to recur provided the terms of the
               subsidiaries remain. These businesses are hinted at in the “Other Business” discussion in the
               Segments section.
                   Exhibit 3 reveals the firm’s balance sheets. Of particular interest is the current ratio of nearly
               3.2 and cash totaling more than plant property and equipment. The firm also has relatively low
               long-term debt, low goodwill, and even low inventory levels. All can be viewed as attractive de-
               pending on aspirations of the firm and the strategic path it is undertaking.

               Segments
               Grains & Agribusiness: Flour Milling
               PPB’s Grains and Agribusiness segment operates through FFM Berhad, which is an 80-percent
               subsidiary of PPB with four principles businesses: 1) Flour Milling, 2) Animal Feed Milling,
               3) Livestock Farming, and 4) Organic Fertilizers. In total, this segment experienced a revenue

                                                                                                        CASE 8 • PPB Group Berhad—2022    453


               reduction of less than 1 percent in fiscal 2020, but profits were up 28 percent due to lower raw ma-
               terial cost and a higher share of profits from associates. The segment generated 76 percent of fiscal
               2020 revenues and 19 percent of profits. For the purposes of this case and to avoid confusion, PPB
               will be used throughout, as they are the parent company and the majority owners of FFM Berhad.
                    The flour-milling business has a Malaysian capacity of over 2,800 metric tons daily, operating
               through 5 flour mills strategically located in Malaysia, making it Malaysia’s largest flour miller.
               It also has 2 flour mills in Vietnam, 1 in Thailand (with a capacity of 670 metric tons per day)
               through a 43 percent stake in Kerry Flour Mills Ltd., and 1 in Indonesia. In addition, PPB controls
               a 20 percent stake in 9 associates in China, with a combined capacity of 17,550 metric tons a day,
               resulting in a controlling stake in China overall (as opposed to all flour mills in the country) that
               exceeds the firm’s production output in its home market of Malaysia. However, it appears data
               from China may not be included in the financials of this segment on the Annual Report.
                    The mills generate many products from the wheat flour, including bread, noodles, biscuits,
               and cakes. In addition, several of the flour products are considered specialties, such as whole
               meal or semolina, while other flour products are marketed as improvers or premixes for bread
               and cakes. By late 2021, PPB expected to double its capacity in the production of flour in
               Vietnam.

               Grains & Agribusiness: Animal Feed
               In 1981, PPB entered the animal feed business with a modest capacity of 10,000 metric tons of
               feed annually, but today this business has a capacity of over 2,200 metric tons per day across 5
               mills in Malaysia, making the firm a major provider of feed in the country. The different types
               of feed are marketed under the brand names Friendship and Five Rings and available in three
               distinct forms: mash, crumble, and pellet. Products are tailored to meet the individual diets of
               the intended animals, which include broilers, poultry, duck, ruminants, quail, and rabbit. PPB is
               currently saving costs by including lower-cost feed ingredients in its products.

               Grains & Agribusiness: Livestock Farming
               In 1993, PPB forward integrated into broiler day-old chicks and eggs. Under the brand name
               “Swarney Select,” PPB is able to produce over 3 million day-old chicks every month in 2 farms lo-
               cated in Malaysia. The farms are both closed-housing facilities, which limits the spread of diseases
               commonly associated with raising poultry. The firm’s chicken farms have the capacity to produce
               20 million eggs a month and are marketed under the brand names Seri Murni, Seri Murni Fresh
               Eggs, and Seri Murni Premium Eggs. Over 2020, this segment explored new markets and sales
               channels, including new ways to brand existing products. Historically, Malaysia has one of the
               highest poultry and egg consumption populations in the world per capita. However, this business is
               a difficult one in Malaysia because of overproduction, cheaper imported frozen chicken, and gov-
               ernmental price controls on chicken during holiday seasons. With the rise in government regulations
               and as independent farmers join cooperatives, the pressure on raising poultry continues to rise.

               Grains & Agribusiness: Organic Fertilizers
               Composted chicken manure is a byproduct of raising and growing chickens, enabling PPB to
               also produce organic fertilizer. Bags are sold under the brand name Organic in 25-kilo quantities,
               which suggests untapped potential for smaller-volume customers.

               Film Exhibition and Distribution
               The Film Exhibition and Distribution (FE&D) segment of PPB includes the following activities:
                   1. Film Exhibition: Golden Screen Cinemas (GSC) has 339 screens at 33 locations in
                      Malaysia, plus 18 locations and 108 screens in Vietnam.
                   2. Film Distribution: GSC Movies Sdn Bhd distributes films and TV shows in Malaysia,
                      Brunei, Vietnam, Myanmar, and Cambodia.
                  GSC’s 33 theaters and 339 screens in Malaysia make it the leading movie provider in the
               country. A 40-percent stake in Vietnam-based Galaxy Studio extends PPB’s movie theater busi-
               ness to this key regional market. Financial results associated with this division were likely harmed
               by COVID-19 more than any other segment of PPB as box office revenue dropped by 85 percent
               in Malaysia (and 71 percent in the global film industry). Golden Screen Cinemas has started

                                   snacks and movie treats to customers unable to visit the theaters in person. For the long-term,
                                   GSC is optimistic the industry will continue to grow and be profitable. Reducing its dependence
                                   on Hollywood, the firm is forward integrating to co-produce its own movies, made in Malaysia.
                                   The new Happy Food Company concept being rolled out across its theaters provides customers
                                   with new and exciting food and beverages to enjoy while watching the movies. In 2020, MBO,
                                   formerly the third largest cinema in Malaysia, was purchased by GSC, adding 26 cinemas to the
                                   GSC line if they choose to keep all of MBO’s properties in operation.

                                   Environmental Engineering and Utilities
                                   Through its subsidiaries, PPB is a leading firm in water and sewage management in Malaysia.
                                   For the long term, PPB is attempting to focus increasingly on cutting costs in the utilities seg-
                                   ment through operational efficiency tactics, improvements in technologies, and working more
                                   closely with project management teams.
                                       The Environmental Engineering and Utilities (EE&U) segment of PPB is led by the
                                   Chemquest Group, in which PPB has a 55-percent equity interest. This segment includes
                                   1) water engineering, 2) solid waste management, 3) sewage treatment, and 4) flood mitigation.

                                   Consumer Products Segment
                                   Many consumers in Southeast Asia will recognize brands owned by the Consumer Products
                                   Segment of PPB. Currently, the products sold include bakery items, edible oils, and chilled and
                                   frozen foods, which reach over 42,000 retail locations in Malaysia, served through 13 ware-
                                   houses. Massimo, one of the more notable PPB brands, specializes in bakery items. During 2020,
                                   PPB acquired BRF Foods GmbH, a processed-food manufacturer. PPB is currently seeking to
                                   increase brand awareness and effect a slow shift toward providing more packaged and canned
                                   products, particularly flour and frozen food, as demand for them is projected to grow. Two no-
                                   table products introduced in 2020 are the Massimo Primo Sandwich Bun and Massimo Favorito
                                   Lemon Krunch Cream Roll.

                                   Property Segment
                                   PPB’s vision within the Property Segment is to continue to provide customers with trusted
                                   property options that will improve local communities. Many of the properties in develop-
                                   ment are high-rise buildings such as the Cheras Leisure Mall, The Whiteways Arcade, and
                                   the most recent property, the Megah Rise, a condominium with 228 apartments and retail
                                   space. Currently, managers of this division are increasing its online shopping options, and
                                   the long-term plan is to acquire further land to develop both commercial and residential
                                   properties, with a focus on high-rise style buildings to save space. This segment is focused

                                   This segment of PPB includes diverse operations under the following headings:
                                    1. Investment Holding & Trading: Chemquest Sdn Bld and Malayan Adhesives and
                                       Chemicals Sdn Bld
                                    2. Investment Holding: Masuma Trading Company, Hexarich Sdn Bdh, Orion Fund Pte Ltd.,
                                       and Orion Fund II Pte Ltd.
                                    3. IT Services: Eat (M) Sdn Bhd, Enterprise Advanced System Intelligence Pte Ltd., and Easi
                                       Ticketing Sdn Bhd
                                    4. Integrated Agribusiness: Wilmar International Limited
                                       Exhibit 4 shows PPB’s revenues and profits by segment. Note that data is not provided for
                                   investment and other operations, and a large percentage of the firm’s income could be derived
                                   from the Investments and Other Operations segment. The two largest and most significant seg-
                                   ments are Grains & Agribusiness and Film Exhibition & Distribution.
                                       Exhibit 5 reveals that Malaysia accounts for 68 percent of PPB’s 2020 revenues, but revenues
                                   were down over most regions in 2020. The Vietnam region enjoyed an increase of 12 percent in
                                   revenues, which also correlates to this region being the fastest-growing country in the region by
                                   some measures.

               Strategy
               PPB is a leading Grain & Agriculture business in Southeast Asia as well as a leading business
               in cinemas. Unfortunately, the firm’s Environmental Engineering & Utilities and Property seg-
               ments do not generate significant revenue. PPB’s second largest revenue generating segment is
               its Consumer Products. Recall that the firm did not have a clear vision or mission statement and
               may be conducting business in areas it should avoid. PPB has aggressively acquired other cinema
               retailers and is actively adding capacity in milling and grains. According to the Annual Report,
               the firm plans to expand its property business with malls and condos.

               External Issues
               Southeast Asia Region Snapshot
               The Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) was established in 1967 to promote eco-
               nomic growth and stability in the region. ASEAN has 10 member states, but 6 countries account
               for most of the growth and vitality of the organization: Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines,
               Singapore, Thailand, and Vietnam. The growing macroeconomic climate in most Southeast
               Asian countries is spurring a change in eating habits as there are more and more middle-income
               and upper-middle-income consumers who seek more Western foods like pasta and baked goods
               rather than a traditional diet dominated by rice.

               ASEAN Countries
               Singapore is a republic of 5.7 million people and one of the world’s busiest transportation hubs for
               container ports. Singapore’s international airport has over 5,000 weekly flights, and this country is
               often ranked as the best in the world for ease of doing business. The people of Singapore are a mix
               of Chinese, Malay, Indian, and Eurasian; they are generally highly educated and excellent business-
               persons. Singapore’s GDP is forecast to grow annually by 2.3 percent through 2024.
                   With a population of about 270 million, Indonesia is composed of 17,000 islands, including
               Java, Sumatra, Kalimantan, Sulawesi, Papua, Bali Lombok, and Komodo. Indonesia offers an
               excellent business environment and a stable political system. About 60 percent of the country’s

                                   population and economic activity are on the island of Java. The capital of Indonesia is Jakarta,
                                   but there is an ongoing debate in the country about moving the capital from an overcrowded
                                   Jakarta to Borneo, in the eastern part of the country. President Joko Widodo says the new capital
                                   of Borneo will be very modern and green, and the move is likely to come to fruition in the year
                                   2024. Indonesia’s GDP growth is forecast to reach 5.1 percent by 2024, as a steady decline in the
                                   unemployment rate is fueling consumption of products and services. The expansion of special
                                   economic zones (SEZs) is also benefiting the economy and all Indonesians.
                                       Indonesia is spending Rp 466 trillion (about $33 billion) to move all government offices, the
                                   military, police, and parliament to Borneo. However, Jakarta will remain the country’s financial
                                   and commercial centerpiece. Indonesia has about 30 flour-milling companies with a production
                                   capacity of about 15 million tons of flour.
                                       The Philippines offers potential businesses and tourists a population of about 110 million and
                                   a rapidly growing consumer market. Filipino employees are known worldwide for their profi-
                                   ciency in English and their professionalism, work ethic, persistence, determination, and technical
                                   skills. The Philippines’s capital is Manila, but the most populated city is Quezon City, and the
                                   largest island is Luzon, followed by Mindanao. GDP growth in the Philippines is estimated to be
                                   6.2 percent up to 2024 as the country’s labor market conditions are spurring consumption.
                                       With Bangkok as its capital, Thailand is an economically and politically stable country with
                                   about 70 million residents. Tourism accounts for about 20 percent of Thailand’s GDP, which is
                                   estimated to be 3.2 percent up to 2024 as the country continually encourages capital formation
                                   and investment.
                                       With a population of about 100 million people, Vietnam has transformed in the last 10 years
                                   from one of the poorest nations in the world to a rapidly growing place to do business. Unlike
                                   many countries in the region, Vietnam allows 100 percent foreign ownership of businesses in
                                   most sectors. Vietnam is rapidly building highways and seaports and offers relatively low tax
                                   rates and other incentives for firms to initiate or expand operations in the country. Vietnam’s
                                   GDP is forecast be about 6.5 up to 2024 due to a robust investment climate and its excellent
                                   foreign investment strategies.

                                   Malaysia
                                   Malaysia is arguably the most technologically advanced country in Southeast Asia. Malaysia
                                   has the fourth largest economy in the region and the 36th largest economy in the world. Its main
                                   industries include electronics, semiconductors, microchips, rubber, oleochemicals, automotives,
                                   optical devices, pharmaceuticals, and medical equipment. With a population of about 32 million
                                   people, the country’s GDP per capita is about $12,000. Malaysian companies export globally, but
                                   especially to China, Singapore, Japan, Bangladesh, Hong Kong, Thailand, India, and the United
                                   States. Malaysia’s GDP growth is forecast to reach 4.4 percent annually by 2024 as the country
                                   continually improves its digital infrastructure.
                                        The Malaysian economy contracted 5.6 percent in 2020, primarily due to constrictions on the
                                   movement of people because of COVID-19, and the company’s cinema business was especially
                                   hard hit. The country’s ease-of-doing-business rank globally was 12th (out of 190 countries) in
                                   2020. Malaysia also has excellent natural resources and is the world’s 11th largest producer of
                                   manganese, the 11th largest producer of tin, the 12th largest producer of bauxite, the 19th largest
                                   producer of lime, and the 2nd largest producer of palm oil behind Indonesia. Malaysia has proven
                                   oil reserves of about 5 billion barrels. Malaysia has an outstanding highway system and rail net-
                                   work and more than 40 paved airports; it also has excellent access to the sea thanks to its location
                                   on the Strait of Malacca, one of the busiest shipping lanes in the world. Malaysia’s Port Klang
                                   and Port of Tanjung Pelepas are the 2nd and 3rd busiest ports in Southeast Asia behind Singapore.
                                        Malaysia offers potential businesses and visitors a well-educated and highly diverse work-
                                   force. The country has an excellent digital infrastructure and is a major regional hub for financial,
                                   information and communications technology, and logistic sectors. Malaysia is a major tourist
                                   destination as well.

                                   Animal Feed
                                   The growth of populations and income levels in Southeast Asia presents a large opportunity for
                                   firms engaging in all types of businesses, including agricultural businesses. According to the
                                   United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), the region encompassing Indonesia, Malaysia,
                                   the Philippines, Thailand, and Vietnam are currently importing soybean meal faster than any region

               in the world. In fact, according to the USDA, this region as well as Brunei, Cambodia, Laos,
               Myanmar, and Singapore will import more soybean meal than European Union by 2022, making it
               the number one importer of soybean meal in the world. Soybean meal is a key component in ani-
               mal feed, but the region lacks factories that can crush the soybean into animal feed, which is both a
               major opportunity and a threat. As such, soybean meal accounts for a larger percentage of imports
               than whole soybeans. The foremost supplier of soybean to Southeast Asia is the United States,
               with Brazil coming in second. Cheaper soybean has enabled many companies to produce healthier
               livestock meals for animals. Malaysia, for example, is a country that has no soybean production
               of its own and must import all soybeans for use. Other nations produce soybeans only marginally.
               Similar patterns are present with corn as well, with the region being heavily reliant on imports.
                    Other grains—such as corn—are also rapidly increasing. Indonesia, Vietnam, and Malaysia
               import more corn than any country other in this region. However, before competitors jump at the
               opportunity, governments are implementing restrictions on imports. For example, the Philippines
               has a tariff quota on corn imports, and Indonesia flat out limits the amount of corn that can be
               imported.
                    Overall growth is strong in the region. The three wealthiest nations, in order, are Singapore,
               Brunei, and Malaysia, followed by Thailand, Indonesia, Philippines, and Vietnam. GPD in
               Singapore is around $12,000, which is double that of Thailand. Most GDP numbers in the region
               are increasing approximately 3.5 percent, but Vietnam is growing at a faster rate of around 4.5
               percent. Consumers in Indonesia, Malaysia, and Thailand tend to prefer chicken over pork (pork
               is haram in Muslim-majority Malaysia), while many of the other nations listed above prefer pork
               over chicken, especially Vietnam (and China). However, seafood is still the most popular meat
               in the region.

               Animal Feed Consolidation
               Feed mills globally grew rapidly from 2010 to 2015, from 25,000 to over 32,000, but between
               2015 and 2020, they declined by over 12 percent. Feed mills in Asia (including China) peaked at
               over 5,700 in 2015 and as of 2020 stands around 2,600. Feed demand has perhaps declined the
               most in China over this period as feed and animal disease reduced the numbers of smaller mills.
               However, many of the older mills in Southeast Asia did not close, easing productivity in this
               region. Nevertheless, feed demand declined by perhaps 6 percent in Malaysia, the Philippines,
               Thailand, and Vietnam in 2020.

               Southeast Asia Meat Production
               Exhibit 6 reveals poultry production in five key markets in Southeast Asia. Thailand and
               Indonesia are significantly larger markets than Malaysia on poultry production, but Malaysia has
               a larger GDP than both nations. A problem for some firms in this region is that competitors based

                                   in nations with lower GPD, such as Thailand, can grow livestock cheaper and even export to
                                   richer nations such as Malaysia, where consumers can purchase at lower prices than the domestic
                                   chicken. Thailand, for example, is a significant player in the poultry export business (only behind
                                   Brazil, the United States, and the European Union), exporting around 0.40 metric tons of poultry
                                   in 2010. This rose to 1 metric ton in 2020 and is expected to rise further to 1.4 metric tons by
                                   2028, according to research by the USDA.
                                       Exhibit 7 reveals pork production in the region. It is interesting to note that even in nations
                                   such as Malaysia, where chicken is more popular (and not haram), pork production actually ex-
                                   ceeds chicken production. This is because of large markets for pork exports like China.

                                   Rivals of PPB’s Golden Screen Cinemas—the largest cinema in Malaysia—include TGV
                                   Cinemas and Lotus Five Star. TGV Cinemas, sometimes referred to as TGV Pictures, is the sec-
                                   ond largest movie theater in Malaysia, with 35 multiplexes and 282 screens. Of the 35 screens,
                                   33 are on Peninsular Malaysia and the remaining 2 are located in Sarawak. The firm has plans to
                                   open 4 additional cinemas. TGV is a robust rival offering plush seating and even large seating for
                                   families. Children’s playrooms are also provided in some locations. Lotus Five Star is a relatively

                                   in poultry processing, animal feed, and palm-oil production. The company has new automated
                                   manufacturing plants for animal feed and could easily expand its operations from India into

                                       The world’s largest flour-milling production facility is owned and operated by P.T. Bogasari
                                   Flour Mills in Jakarta, Indonesia. This particular manufacturing plant was expanded further in
                                   2020–2021, reflecting the accelerating importance of flour-based products in all of Southeast Asia.

               This single plant produces more than 4 million tons of flour annually. An industry insider recently
               said that the demand for flour-based products will continue to grow about 5 percent annually
               throughout Southeast Asia. Having about 2,500 workers, Bogasari controls 50 percent market share
               of the Indonesian flour milling business, down from a high of 70 percent a decade earlier.

               Conclusion
               Strategy Considerations
               Any time a business of any size or type is diversified in its product offerings, effective allocation
               of available capital and human resources across products and regions is of paramount importance
               and necessitates excellent strategic planning. PPB is a huge, diversified conglomerate in need of
               a clear strategic plan to guide decision-making. Should PPB strive to capitalize move effectively
               on rapidly developing countries in Southeast Asia such as Vietnam? Could PPB’s traditional
               cinema operations survive a renewed pandemic or should the company shift focus to its other
               businesses or even new business areas? With regard to flour and animal-feed milling and bread
               production, the demand for such products will increase as the population and tourism levels of
               various countries increase.
                   Recall from the case that the firm’s mission and vision are likely too general, and consid-
               eration should be taken on how both should be altered. Factors to include are how PPB should
               allocate its resources among segments and whether any segments should be sold off. As there
               are few mills in the region that can crush soybean, resulting in most soybean being imported as
               crushed products, should PPB enter the crushed soybean milling business? Should the firm move
               more operations to Vietnam since labor is cheaper? What is the solution for cheaper chicken
               from Vietnam underpricing PPB’s chicken in Malaysia?
                   Develop for Lim Soon Huat, Managing Director of PPB Group, a strategic plan that you
               believe will lead the company to prosperity. Recall from the case that consumption patterns in
               Southeast Asia in general are moving further away from rice to more flour-based products and
               this bodes well for PPB if the company can capitalize on such external opportunities. A compre-
               hensive strength-weakness-opportunity-threat (SWOT) analysis and portfolio analysis is needed
               to facilitate PPB’s decision-making moving forward. Be sure to include in your analysis what
               you feel the firm should be doing, not what they are currently doing or what you think they will
               be doing after studying the latest news releases (unless, of course, you agree with these strate-
               gies). PPB is in desperate need of a clear strategic plan as they service a rapidly growing regional
               market with multiple product lines that differ significantly.

                                   Nestlé is headquartered in Vevey, Switzerland, has over 273,000 employees, serves 186 coun-
                                   tries, and is the largest food producing company that sells finished, ready-for-consumption food
                                   products. In 2020, Nestlé had four times the revenue of Kraft Heinz Company, the second largest
                                   food-producing firm in the world. Notable product categories that Nestlé offers include baby
                                   food, pet foods, ice cream, chocolate, coffee, frozen goods, water, and weight management prod-
                                   ucts. Top Nestlé brands include Carnation, Coffee Mate, Nescafé, Perrier, DiGiorno, Stouffers,
                                   Lean Cuisine, Nesquik, Milo, Haagen-Dazs, Purina pet foods, Butterfinger, Baby Ruth, and
                                   Nestlé Toll House, with hundreds more besides. For example, Nestlé has over 70 bottled water
                                   brands alone and over 100 chocolate and confectionary brands. Currently, Nestlé is focusing on
                                   its premium water business, divesting its U.S. ice cream business to Forneri, and divesting its
                                   low-priced water business in the United States.
                                        In fiscal 2020, Nestlé launched over 1,200 new products, and 33 million children benefited
                                   from Nestlé’s Healthier Kids program. Nestlé is increasingly focusing on organic products, with
                                   less emphasis on meat and dairy products as discussed throughout the case. In fact, in 2019, 2.8
                                   billion vegetables portions were added to the company’s food and beverages segment, and since
                                   2010, 235 million coffee saplings have been distributed. Nestlé also reports that its emission of
                                   greenhouse gases has been reduced by 37 percent since 2010, 50 percent of its electricity is de-
                                   rived from renewable sources, and 368 factories have achieved zero waste. Nestlé continues to
                                   promote healthy food and a clean environment while charging affordable prices for its customers.

                                   History
                                   Many people instantly associate Nestlé first with chocolate, but Nestlé’s roots are embed-
                                   ded in milk products, in particular baby formula. Nestlé got started in 1866, when the Anglo-
                                   Swiss Condensed Milk Company first opened a milk factory in Cham, Switzerland. Nestlé was
                                   founded one year later when a German pharmacist, Henri Nestlé, saved a neighbor’s child in
                                   Vevey, Switzerland, from starvation through a combination of cow’s milk, wheat flour, and
                                   sugar. Fittingly, Nestlé’s logo always has been that of a mother bird feeding her new hatchlings.
                                       More recently, Nestlé diversified into the pet food business in 2001 with its acquisition of
                                   Ralston Purina. Nestlé purchased the American baby food giant Gerber in 2007 along with
                                   Wyeth Nutrition from Pfizer Nutrition a few years later to strengthen its baby nutrition busi-
                                   ness. In 2014, Nestlé expanded its Nestlé Skin Health S.A. business to capitalize on the grow-
                                   ing trends of global skin care.
                                       In 2014, Nestlé’s then CEO Paul Bulcke diversified the company into skin health, having
                                   spent $5 billion on acquisitions in 2014 to acquire L’Oreal SA’s stake in a joint venture, plus
                                   rights to drugs from Valeant Pharmaceuticals International. Nestlé has since divested these
                                   businesses.
                                       Food companies like Nestlé reported a slump in frozen-food sales in 2016 because of a move
                                   toward “fresh” or “natural” food. Though frozen vegetables are often as wholesome as their fresh
                                   counterparts, frozen meals and snacks are widely considered to be full of sodium and other pre-
                                   servatives. In 2016, Nestlé revamped its frozen-food brands Lean Cuisine and Stouffer’s.

                                   Vision and Mission
                                   Based on Nestlé’s Annual Report, the following will serve as plausible vision and mission
                                   statements.

                                   Vision Statement
                                   We strive to produce the healthiest and tastiest food with the aim to improve life for everyone on

               Mission Statement
               Our philosophy at Nestlé is to hire the most talented scientists and most devoted employees as
               we strive to provide the most nutritious foods, drinks, and pet foods to our customers. Quality,
               healthy, affordable foods should be available to everyone around the world. We are committed
               to controlling costs and conducting business in an ethical way that has a neutral impact on the
               environment.

               Internal Issues
               Organizational Structure
               Nestlé’s organizational structure is based on strategic business units (SBUs) as illustrated at the
               company website (www.nestle.com/aboutus/management). Exhibit 1 provides a list of Nestlé’s
               top executives along with their titles. Paul Bulcke once served as CEO but is now Chairman
               of the board. Note that the three SBUs are by region and headed by Marco Settembri, Laurent
               Freixe, and Chris Johnson.

               Finance
               Nestlé’s income statements are provided in Exhibit 2. Note that Nestlé had a difficult year in
               2020, with sales down nearly 9 percent. In contrast, rival Hershey reported a sales increase of 2
               percent in revenues, General Mills reported a 3 percent increase, and Kraft had a nearly 5 percent
               increase. Nestlé attributes the decline to COVID-19, an 8 percent appreciation of the Swiss Franc
               to most currencies, and divestures that added a 4.5 percent decline in sales. A plus for Nestlé is
               that operating expenses decreased 11 percent, resulting in net income only dropping 4 percent
               compared to the 9 percent drop in revenues.
                   Exhibit 3 shows Nestlé’s 2019 and 2020 fiscal balance sheets. Note the large portion of good-
               will and intangible assets. Nestlé has been active in 2021 acquiring new firms, so bear in mind
               the new goodwill amount on the 2021 statements and beyond. Is Nestlé overpaying for their
               acquisitions?

               Segments
               Nestlé reports segment data both by seven different product classifications and by three different
               geographic regions. By product, Nestlé reports that its Powdered and Liquid Beverages segment
               contributed CHF 22.2 billion in 2020, followed by PetCare with CHF 14 billion. The remaining
               product lines with their 2020 revenues are shown in Exhibit 4.

               Powdered and Liquid Beverages
               Nestlé’s most profitable segment in terms of 2020 revenues, Powdered and Liquid Beverages,
               accounts for over CHF 22 billion in sales and represents 26 percent of total sales and a margin of
               22.5 percent. Top coffee brands included in this segment are Nescafé, Nespresso, and Starbucks.
               Another top coffee brand in this segment is Dolce Gusto, which is commonly delivered in pods
               similar to Keurig coffee. Nestlé claims their Dolce Gusto’s New Orleans is the first cold brew
               coffee of its type. Nestlé has a partnership arrangement with the coffee giant Starbucks whereby
               Nestlé provides expertise with producing quality instant coffee while Starbucks lends its qual-
               ity coffee and brand name, creating delicious Starbucks instant coffee in the same manner as
               Nescafe coffee. Milo, the most popular malt coffee drink in the world is also a Nestlé product.
               Recently, the Milo brand has extended its product line by including Milo Plant, which uses soy
               and oats to replace milk as an increasing number of people globally are consuming less meat and
               dairy products.

               PetCare
               Nestlé states that as people have better lives when their lives are shared with pets, it is the firm’s
               aspiration to ensure these pets receive the healthiest cost-effective food available. This segment
               reported sales of CHF 14 billion, with a margin of 22 percent, representing nearly 17 percent of
               Nestlé sales. Employing over 500 scientists, veterinarians, and other experts in pet care, Purina
               provides affordable nutrition to pets that enables significantly healthier lives. Purina ONE, Pro
               Plan, Friskies, and Tidy Cats are all brands owned by Nestlé.
                   Nestlé is constantly marketing their pet food products heavily to keep pet owners buying.
               For example, in their Annual Report, Nestlé claims to be “disrupting the cat treat segment”;
               however, reading more about exactly what this disruption entails reveals that Nestlé is simply
               making cat treats similar to their candy bars, where the treats can be broken into smaller pieces
               easily, allowing the cat to enjoy the treats for a longer time. Another marketing-oriented message
               is “providing nature-inspired meals,” where natural ingredients such as tuna are used with toma-
               toes and rice, without artificial colors or flavorings. One key omission from Nestlé’s discussion
               of pet products is the true extent of how much healthier these products are. The developments in
               the PetCare segment read as a rebranding (or marketing tactics) rather than meaningful changes
               in nutrition.

               Nutrition and Health Science
               One of the largest brands within this segment is Gerber, but NAN, Illume, and Cerelac are other
               blockbuster brands owned by Nestlé. This segment accounts for over CHF 12 billion in sales and
               represents over 14 percent of corporate sales. Nestlé’s NAN supplements are designed as a re-
               placement or supplement for a mother’s breast milk. Baby formula Belsol was produced in coor-
               dination with Alibaba’s innovation center, and Nestlé’s Annual Report claims that the product is
               tailored for Chinese babies. BrainXpert is a drink product that, according to Nestlé, is “clinically
               proven” to increase brain functioning in people with cognitive difficulties, which research says
               affects about 20 percent of all people over 65 around the world. Other products in this segment
               focus on food allergies and supporting healthy mitochondria. A common theme across all Nestlé
               divisions is a push toward marketing heavily and producing products that can be marketed as

               Besides the baby food, chocolate, and coffee the brand is widely associated with, Nestlé also
               owns top brands such as Maggi, Stouffer’s, Lean Cuisine, Magic Sarap, Totole cooking sauces,
               and even DiGiorno. Unlike coffee, where consumption habits around the world are strikingly
               similar, many of the food items offered here are regional in nature.

    464    STRATEGIC-MANAGEMENT CASE ANALYSIS

                                       Nestlé’s Prepared Dished and Cooking Aids segment contributes CHF 11.5 billion in sales
                                   and accounts for just under 14 percent of total sales. Like other divisions, Nestlé is marketing
                                   heavily plant-based options by offering more veggie pizzas, but new products like veggie burgers
                                   and the firm’s Sensational Vuna (a plant-based alternative to tuna) require significant R&D and
                                   tactical and strategic adjustments—these are much more than simply marketing ploys. In 2021,
                                   Nestlé plans to launch a new plant-based Awesome Burger.

                                   Milk Products and Ice Cream
                                   The milk-product segment reported 11 billion in CHF sales, accounting for 13 percent of cor-
                                   porate sales in 2020. Keep in mind from the introduction that Nestlé recently divested its U.S.
                                   ice cream business. This segment is an ironic development for Nestlé, as the firm is aggressively
                                   marketing less dairy, less meat, and more plant-based products in their other segments while still
                                   operating a billion-dollar business within the milk product segment. However, in accordance
                                   with the other segments, Nestlé also promotes plant-based alternatives, with notable brands such
                                   as Nesfit, Nido, Coffee-mate, nesQino, Carnation, Moca, and La Lechera.
                                       Many of the brands in this segment are regional, targeting a specific group of customers.
                                   The regions include the United States, Europe, Japan, and China—these are not small markets
                                   by any means. Against a growing number of people worldwide who are lactose intolerant and a
                                   more health-minded public, brands owned by Nestlé such as Ninho, Nesfit Sabor Natural, and
                                   Carnation all launched plant-based products in 2020. Carnation, a thick, fatty, and sweet con-
                                   densed milk product, is now offering a plant-based option that—importantly—tastes good.

                                   Confectionery
                                   Nestlé’s confectionery segment may be what many people worldwide picture first when they
                                   think of the company, yet this segment reported sales of CHF 7 billion in 2020, representing only
                                   8 percent of total sales for Nestlé. Many of the products in this segment are regional and even
                                   local brands. One of the reasons is that Nestlé has purchased many successful product lines from
                                   local regions and incorporated them in their portfolio; this acquisition strategy continues today.
                                   Nestlé is also committed in this segment to providing food options based on plants, with a line
                                   of protein bars offering 10 grams of protein derived from plants, mostly from nuts and peas. Of
                                   course, within this segment is chocolate, a product perhaps loved more around the world than
                                   coffee. However, to keep chocolate exciting, Nestlé often offers chocolate in new formats, in-
                                   cluding gift boxes and seasonal items designed for religious and national holidays.

                                   Water
                                   The final segment Nestlé divides its portfolio of products into is water. Consumers may argue
                                   about whether S.Pellegrino or Perrier is better, but both are Nestlé products, along with many
                                   other local sparkling water brands. This segment has pledged to be carbon neutral by 2025, with
                                   S.Pellegrino and Acqua Panna pledging to be carbon neutral by 2022. Of course, this carbon
                                   neutrality likely does not include shipping the product to stores, as providing water through a
                                   pipeline is still much more economically friendly, both in terms of transporting and packaging.
                                   Nestlé is aware of these facts and committed to a waste-free future through recyclable or reus-
                                   able packaging, and it currently uses recycled plastic in most of its water bottles. Maintaining the
                                   plant-based theme, Buxton is a new plant-infused water that blends spring water, plant polyphe-
                                   nols, and minerals with fruit flavors. This segment reported 6.4 billion in CHF sales in 2020 and
                                   accounted for 7.6 percent of companywide sales.

                                   By-Region Data
                                   Exhibit 4 reveals the top 5 2020 revenue-generating nations for Nestlé in billions of CHF. Note
                                   how large Nestlé’s presence is in the United States and how much growth likely remains possible
                                   in other regions. For example, the United States generates over four times the revenues as the
                                   next largest nation, China. Nestlé’s home nation of Switzerland ranks sixteenth in the world, with
                                   2020 Nestlé revenues of CHF 1.1 billion. Global powers Germany and Japan rank eighth and
                                   tenth respectively, with CHF 2.4 billion and CHF 1.6 billion in sales, respectively. Remember
                                   that Germany, Japan, and Switzerland are included in the “Rest of the World” numbers below.
                                   Nestlé reported 45 percent of its revenues were derived from North, Central, and South America;
                                   29 percent derived from North Africa, Middle East, Europe, and Russia; and 26 percent from
                                   sub-Saharan Africa, Asia, and Oceania.

                   Exhibit 5 reveals that only pet-care products reported an increase in revenues in fiscal year
               2020. This is concerning for Nestlé because key rival firms had an increase in overall revenues in
               the same year against Nestlé’s justifications of COVID-19, the Swiss Franc, and divestures. Recall
               from the introduction that Nestlé sold its U.S. ice cream business, so this divestiture does explain a
               large portion of the drop in ice cream revenue. Note that revenues for the milk and ice cream seg-
               ment dropped over 17 percent from 2019 to 2020 but operating profits jumped 56 ­percent in 2020,
               so it appears on the surface that the divesture of the U.S. ice cream business was a strong strategic
               move for Nestlé. Note as well the high profit margin for water; the firm may not generate signifi-
               cant income from this division relative to others and sales and operating profits may have decreased
               in 2020, yet the segment is an extremely cost-effective business to operate.

                                   Nestlé is in the process of transforming its image from a food company to a health and wellness
                                   company. While the company has no plans to stop selling the chocolate, coffee, ice cream and other
                                   food products that the firm is world-famous for, it is actively engaged in offering healthier food op-
                                   tions to customers. Nestlé has the largest R&D budget of any food company; the firm aims to offer
                                   healthier and tastier options right from infant formula all the way to products designed for seniors.
                                   Nestlé recently reduced the amount of salt, sugar, and saturated fats in many of its products as a
                                   means of improving nutrition while enhancing other flavors so as not to compromise the taste of
                                   their products. Pay careful attention to the added flavors section later in the case.
                                       Nestlé has a large portfolio of products globally and is active in shifting its resources around
                                   through acquisitions and divesting product lines. In 2020, Nestlé sold its 60 percent ownership in
                                   Herta to Casa Tarradellas. In food, Nestlé purchased the Yinlu peanut milk and canned rice por-
                                   ridge business in 2020. With respect to growth, Nestlé is strongly focused on increasing its global
                                   growth in water due to its extremely high profit margin. However, in 2021, Nestlé sold its Nestlé
                                   Waters North America brands, which included Poland Spring, Deer Park, and Ice Mountain. Most
                                   of these waters came with low margins, unlike the expensive mineral and sparkling waters more
                                   commonly sold in Europe. The deal did not include mega brands such as S.Pellegrino Perrier and
                                   Acqua Panna. In fact, only a month after Nestlé sold the North American water business, it ac-
                                   quired Essential, a U.S.-based water that sells at a premium and likely has a high profit margin.
                                       Nestlé is increasingly focusing on the lucrative water market outside the United States as
                                   well. Nestlé is also expanding the Health Science division through the acquisitions of Zenpep,
                                   Vital Proteins, Aimmune Therapeutics and others. The Aimmune acquisition allowed Nestlé to
                                   control the only “double approved” rug (U.S. Food and Drug Administration and the European
                                   Commission) for the treatment of peanut allergies. In the Spring of 2021, Nestlé acquired Nuun,
                                   a U.S.-based firm producing a tablet and powder to mix with water, similar to Gatorade. In
                                   Spring 2021, Nestlé also acquired The Bountiful Company, which manufactures dietary supple-
                                   ments such as Nature’s Bounty, Solgar, Osteo Bi-Flex, and Puritan’s Pride. The recent history of
                                   divestures and acquisitions suggests that Nestlé is shifting resources away from low-margin to
                                   higher-margin product lines.
                                       To aid with the transition to plant-based protein, in 2020 Nestlé opened a new R&D
                                   Accelerator in Konolfingen, Switzerland, that will enable startups, students, and other partners to
                                   work together using Nestlé’s resources to test projects for up to 6 months. R&D is not limited to
                                   plant-based proteins; at Nestlé, 1.6 billion Swiss Francs are invested in R&D annually, with 23
                                   R&D locations worldwide and 4,000 employees devoted solely to this. In fact, 31 percent of all
                                   sales in 2020 derived from products innovated or renovated over the previous 3 years.

                                   External Issues
                                   Within the food and beverage business, Nestlé competes with global chocolate giants Hershey
                                   and Mars, French-based Danone, European-focused Nomad Foods, U.S.-based Kraft, and many
                                   more. In pet foods, Nestlé competes with—perhaps surprisingly—Mars, which is the world

               leader in pet food in addition to a chocolate company. Del Monte, Procter & Gamble, Kraft, and
               General Mills are also in the pet food business.

               Frozen-Food Industry
               The global frozen-food industry is rapidly growing and becoming much more sophisticated,
               as customers around the globe have more disposable income and are growing more health-­
               conscious. In 2019, the global frozen-food market was valued at $290 billion and is projected
               to increase by nearly 40 percent to $406 billion by 2027. The large increase should provide
               excellent opportunities for firms, also raising the threat of many new entrants into the business,
               all looking for a piece of the action. Representing about 30 percent of all frozen-food purchases
               globally are ready-to-eat frozen meals that contain everything in one package. By contrast, in the
               United States, 45 percent of all frozen foods are considered ready-to-eat entrées.
                    Globally, the next two largest categories of frozen foods are frozen vegetables followed by
               frozen pizza. While the outlook for frozen entrees is expected to continue to grow, the strategist
               should be mindful that the relative market share of frozen entrees may fall due to the increased
               demand globally for frozen pizza. For all the talk of healthy eating around the world, taste and
               convenience still play a significant role in eating habits. Europe is currently the largest market
               for frozen foods, but China and India are growing at the fastest pace. Large global players in the
               industry include ConAgra, Schwan’s Lamb Weston, and Nestlé. Profit margins in this industry
               tend to be less than 5 percent, significantly less than in drinks.

               Plant Protein Growth in the United States
               Plant proteins are growing rapidly in popularity around the world and by some estimates, plant-
               based protein will consist of one third of the protein market by 2054. Most of the data is cur-
               rently from the U.S., but the plant-based trend is expected to grow globally as well. Growth in
               traditional foods hovers around 2 percent but if the prediction of 33 percent of all protein being
               derived from plants by 2054 holds, it would represent monumental growth for players in the
               plant-based protein industry. But consumers are after the protein, not simply plants, as 25 percent
               of Americans feel increased protein is beneficial and up to 50 percent of Americans check the
               ingredient list for the source of proteins.
                   In 2019, plant-based meat sales rose over 20 percent, and according to S&P’s Industry
               Surveys, plant-based meat sales outpaced animal meat sales in 2020 partly due to several meat
               plants closing down in 2020 from the pandemic. While the research presented above is for
               Americans, there is strong evidence that plant-based proteins are extremely popular in other
               regions around the world. In fact, over 45 percent of Americans believe plant-based proteins
               are healthier than animal-based and 30 percent of Americans enjoy meat-free days in their diet.
               However, only 6 percent of Americans are categorized as “true” vegetarian (vegan).

               Flavor Enhancers
               There is a growing awareness of sugar’s harmful effects on people, in particular of high-fructose
               corn syrup. Hershey, for example, is replacing high-fructose corn syrup in some of its products
               with sugar, in a move away from a sweetener that is widely seen as increasing weight gain and
               causing diabetes (the American Medical Association has stated that there is not enough evidence
               that it is worse than other sweeteners). A study of perceptions of sweeteners commissioned by
               the Corn Refiners Association found that about two-thirds of consumers believe that modera-
               tion is a more important factor than which sweetener is used. This was borne out when Hunt’s
               ketchup switched from corn syrup to more sugar and then back to corn syrup when there was no
               change in the sales. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has denied requests by some
               companies to have their sweetening agent renamed “corn sugar” on nutrition labels. In addition,
               in July 2015, the FDA proposed that food companies be forced to add the percentage of daily
               allotment of sugar on all nutrition labels, similar to the percentage of daily allotment of salt, fat,
               and other ingredients listed. As of 2021, labels in the United States still only refer to the amount
               of sugars in grams, not percentages of daily allowance. However, any added sugar can have dra-
               matic effects on the body and have been linked to diabetes, tooth decay, heart problems, weight
               gain, and many other health problems.
                   In response to the harmful effects of sugar, there is growing global demand for artificial
               sweeteners as a means to reduce calories, maintain blood sugar levels, and just have an overall

                                   healthier choice. However, research has not been conclusive, and some studies reveal artificial
                                   sweeteners are not dissimilar to raw sugar once ingested. Europe has banned several artificial
                                   sweetener products such as stevia and aspartame, but other nations such as Japan and the United
                                   States have been using the same sweeteners for decades. Nevertheless, there is a growing public
                                   awareness regarding both raw and artificial sugars.
                                       Another common flavor enhancer found in food is salt. Table salt has been linked to water
                                   retention, high blood pressure, stomach cancer, osteoporosis, and killing of beneficial bacterial
                                   in the body. Many medical researchers recommend limiting salt consumption to 6 grams per day;
                                   for comparison, the World Health Organization suggests the average person consumes between 9
                                   and 12 grams of salt daily. Many food companies are attempting to reduce the amount of sodium
                                   in their products as global awareness of the harmful effects of a high-salt diet increases.

                                   Cocoa Prices
                                   Consumers in emerging markets worldwide are able to afford increasingly higher-quality choco-
                                   lates that require better and higher percentages of cocoa. Unlike other crops, such as corn or
                                   soybeans, cocoa is more difficult to produce, and cocoa prices are expected to rise 2.2 percent
                                   globally. Demand is also expected to increase globally, and a minimum price was recently in-
                                   troduced to cocoa producers, but cocoa production is highly labor intensive, and even with the
                                   minimum wage paid, a major threat facing the industry is producers switching to produce less
                                   labor-intensive crops.

                                   Potential Taxes and Health-Minded Public
                                   Growing awareness among consumers has led many different governments (local, regional, and
                                   national) to increase taxes on or flat out ban unhealthy items. Taxes on products like tobacco are
                                   viewed by governments as a way not only to curb citizens’ consumption but also as an additional
                                   source of revenues. In 2014, New York City banned most sugary drinks in 16 oz (500 ml) and
                                   larger quantities from being served. Former NBA star Yao Ming is campaigning in his home
                                   country of China to promote healthier eating and exercise habits.
                                       Increasing obesity is a major problem among the world’s population. A study in the Journal
                                   of the American Medical Association reported people who get 17 to 21 percent of their calories
                                   from added sugar had over four times the chance of dying from cardiovascular disease than
                                   someone limiting their added sugar intake to 8 percent of total calorie intake. Scientific tests sug-
                                   gest that sugar is basically a food for cancer cells, and people who drink two soft drinks a week
                                   are 87 percent more likely to develop pancreatic cancer. For comparison, a Nestlé Butterfinger
                                   and Baby Ruth contains 29 and 33 grams of sugar, respectively, and a can of cola contains about
                                   39 grams of sugar. Sugar is also believed to be damaging to your skin, looks, and overall mood.

                                   Competitors
                                   Kraft Heinz
                                   Headquartered in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, in the United States, Kraft Heinz is a global food
                                   company with many brands popular around the world, including the iconic Heinz Ketchup. The
                                   firm reports offering 4,392 products as of 2021, including deli meats, sauces, drinks, cheeses,
                                   desserts, snacks, soups, and coffee. Some of the more famous brands owned by the company
                                   include Maxwell House Coffee, Miracle Whip, A.1., Jell-O, and Oscar Mayer. The firm even has
                                   partnerships with firms like Hershey to provide chocolate for select Kraft Heinz products. With
                                   its frozen foods, drinks, sweets, and snacks, Kraft Heinz competes directly with Nestlé in many
                                   markets worldwide. Against products such as Oscar Mayer and Lunchables deli meats, Nestlé
                                   does not currently offer a close rival list of matching products. In fact, Nestlé is attempting to po-
                                   sition itself as a healthier nutrition company while rival Kraft Heinz tends to be more traditional
                                   in its product offerings. In 2010, Kraft sold the DiGiorno pizza brand to Nestlé.
                                        In 2021, Kraft Heinz indicated its plans to increase marketing by 30 percent to help Kraft be-
                                   come the industry leader. The firm indicates it also will become more environmentally friendly
                                   and increase its healthy living marketing and products. The firm is in the process of restructur-
                                   ing from 55 individual categories of products to six broad platforms: taste elevation, easy meals

               based in Istanbul, Turkey. Kraft also announced in 2021 that it is selling its nuts business, in-
               cluding Planters, to Hormel Foods, and the firm plans to blend its famous cheese with ice cream
               to produce macaroni-and-cheese flavored ice cream. Kraft Heinz reported revenues of $26.2

               popular brands include cereals (Cheerios), ice cream (Haagen-Dazs), and yogurt (Yoplait). In
               fact, the firm is expanding its cereal business, which may come as a surprise to some, as cereals
               are high-carb and high in sugar, and global trends are moving away from such items. However,
               as mentioned above, taste and convenience are key, and GM considers cereals an important com-
               ponent of the market of those who have less time to cook. Top GM brands include Cheerios,
               Cinnamon Toast Crunch, Lucky Charms, Chex, Total, and Wheaties. Top products considered
               meals include Helper, Old El Paso, Wanchai Ferry, V.Pearl, and Green Giant. The firm com-
               petes in the highly competitive frozen pizza business with brands Annie’s and Totino’s. In 2021,
               GM acquired Tyson Food’s pet treat business for $1.2 billion in cash; this acquisition came on
               the heels of GM entering the pet food business in 2018 with the $8 billion acquisition of Blue
               Buffalo, a premium brand of pet food. Blue Buffalo sales grew at 10 percent over 2020 partly due
               to an increase in new pets worldwide; in the United States, 12.6 million households purchased or
               adopted a new pet in 2020. GM competes on many of Nestlé’s exact product lines.

               Hershey
               Headquartered in Hershey, Pennsylvania, in the United States, Hershey is the largest chocolate
               producer in North America and a confectionary leader worldwide, with over 80 brands, annual
               revenues over $8 billion in 2020, about 15,000 employees, and operations in about 80 countries.
               Hershey offers chocolates as well as other candies, mints, and chewing gum. Notable products
               include Hershey Kisses, Mr. Goodbar, Twizzlers, Jolly Ranchers, Ice Breakers, and Reese’s,
               which Hershey is currently expanding globally with strategic emphasis on markets in China and
               Mexico. Hershey is focused almost entirely on chocolate, candy, and gum, making it a significant
               competitor for Nestlé in this industry.

               Danone
               Danone is a global company based in Paris, France, and reported $24.6 billion in 2020, down
               from $25.3 billion in 2019. The firm has three main business categories: Essential Dairy and
               Plant-Based, Waters, and Specialized Nutrition. Top global brands in the first segment include
               Danone Yogurt, Activia, Oikos, Delight, Danonino, and Silk. Top water brands owned by Danone
               include Aqua, Bonafont, evian, Volvic, and Hayat, and the nutrition business focuses mostly on
               baby foods. In 2020, Danone sold Vega, a Canadian and U.S.-based plant-based food brand to a
               private equity firm in the United States. This is an interesting development as Nestlé is focusing
               heavily on plant-based products, and Danone has perhaps chosen to leave this playing field and
               focus on its more traditional product lines.

               Plant-based Competitors
               Firms like Beyond Meat and Impossible Foods are early players in the trend toward meatless
               products. Beyond Meat, for example, has popular plant-based burgers that many say taste like
               and have the same texture as real meat. While there is a huge trend toward plant-based products
               as concerns about animal welfare and healthier eating increase, the most important factor in get-
               ting customers to switch to plant-based products remains taste, which also includes the texture
               of the product. Despite what many cite as the reason for the switch, health is the second most
               important reason, followed by animal welfare in third.
                   Global firms such as Kellogg, Hormel, and Tyson Foods are entering the plant-based mar-
               ket as well. Tyson, a large meat-producing company, initiated a new brand named Raised &
               Rooted, which offers burgers with a blend of meat and plant-based options. Tyson also offers

                                   100 percent plant-based chicken nuggets. Hormel Foods, another firm specializing in meats,
                                   introduced a new product line called Happy Little Plants, and Kellogg is offering MorningStar
                                   Farms’s Incogmeato.
                                       Research reveals that people who consume a mostly plant-based diet rarely purchase meat,
                                   but nearly 49 out of the 50 consumers who purchase plant-based meat also purchase animal
                                   meat. The global meat market is over $1 trillion, leaving firms competing in this industry to
                                   jockey for position, hoping many of the meat-consuming consumers will also buy plant-based
                                   meat products. It is important to remember that taste is the number one driver, and some items,
                                   such as a thick-cut beef steak, likely will not be replicated closely enough.

                                   Conclusion
                                   Strategy Considerations
                                   From studying the case, you should be aware that Nestlé often divests and acquires new busi-
                                   nesses in addition to spending heavily on its own R&D to bring new products to market. It also
                                   sells off less desirable product lines to competitors. Based on your research, what actions would
                                   you recommend to CEO Bulcke for the next 3 years? Which businesses or product lines, if any,
                                   should be divested? Are there any companies out there that Nestlé should acquire? Should Nestlé
                                   continue to invest heavily in R&D, or would it be more cost-effective to sit back, watch new
                                   firms emerge and risk their own capital, and then simply cherry pick and buy the successful firms
                                   through acquisitions?
                                       Recall that Nestlé receives four times the revenue from the United States than from any other
                                   country. What country or countries would you suggest that the CEO aggressively penetrate fur-
                                   ther? Would it be more profitable for shareholders if Nestlé simply started promoting successful
                                   existing products more heavily in these regions instead of developing new products or acquir-
                                   ing new firms? Recall that when a firm acquires a firm for over book value, the extra amount is
                                   recorded as goodwill on the balance sheet. This is intangible fluff or smoke, generally not con-
                                   sidered an attractive asset by accountants, yet sometimes, as is the case with Nestlé, the decision
                                   is made to accept the goodwill impairment and acquire the desired firm or desired product lines.
                                       As you study and prepare a strategic planning case analysis, be sure to recommend what you
                                   think the future direction of Nestlé should be, not what they are currently doing, and not what
                                   you think they will be doing based on the latest news (unless of course, you agree with these
                                   strategies based on your analysis). Imagine that you have been hired by Nestlé to provide a series
                                   of recommendations for their future direction; this type of analysis and recommendations is in
                                   fact exactly what Nestlé would be paying a consulting firm to deliver for a high fee.

               www.dominos.com, DPZ
               Headquartered in Ann Arbor, Michigan, Domino’s delivers more than 1 million pizzas a day
               worldwide to over 85 different countries, with over half of sales coming from outside the United
               States. To many people’s surprise, Domino’s ranks among the top 10 companies with online
               transactions, right up there with Amazon and Apple; over 60 percent of Domino’s sales in the
               United States are through digital channels. The firm is the second-largest pizza restaurant chain
               in the world with over 14,400 locations and is the number-one pizza delivery company in the
               United States.
                   Domino’s is 97 percent franchised with royalties accounting for a large portion of its rev-
               enue. Selling food, equipment, and supplies primarily to stores in the United States and Canada
               accounts for a large portion of revenue as well. Domino’s has over 260,000 full- and part-time
               employees worldwide that generated sales of over $11 billion in 2017. Over 90 percent of all
               Domino’s franchisees (owners) started their careers working in some capacity in a Domino’s.
                   Domino’s Q1 2018 financials released 4-26-18 were fantastic. Domestic same store sales
               grew 8.3 percent versus Q1 2017. The company’s international division reported that same store
               sales increased 5.0 percent during Q1 2018, marking the 97th consecutive quarter of positive
               international same store sales growth for Domino’s, and the 28th consecutive quarter of positive
               domestic same store sales growth. The company’s global net store growth for Q1 2018 was up
               110 stores, comprised of 79 net new international stores and 31 net new domestic stores. Given
               these excellent results, Domino’s repurchased 448,008 shares of its common stock during Q1
               2018 for approximately $101.1 million. On April 24, 2018, the Board of Directors declared a
               55-cent per share quarterly dividend for shareholders. Domino’s revenues increased $161.2 mil-
               lion, or 25.8 percent in Q1 2018, while net income increased $26.4 million, or 42.2 percent. The
               company is obviously doing well but literally millions of rival firms are taking aim at Domino’s
               in local villages, towns, and cities globally.

               History
               Growing up in foster homes most of their childhood, Tom Monaghan and his brother James bor-
               rowed $900 in 1960 to purchase a mom-and-pop pizza store named Domi-Nick’s in Ypsilanti,
               Michigan. After trading his brother James a Volkswagen Beetle in 1961 for his half of the business,
               Tom changed the store name in 1965 from Domi-Nick’s to Domino’s Pizza Inc. The company expe-
               rienced steady growth during the 1960s, and by 1978 there were 200 Domino’s stores in the United
               States. By 1998, there were over 6,000 Domino’s with 1,500 located outside the United States. Tom
               Monaghan retired in 1998 by selling 93 percent of the company, worth $1 billion, to Bain Capital
               Inc. In the 6 years following the sale, Domino’s enjoyed great success under Bain Capital and in
               2004, Domino’s became a publicly traded company. The initial stock price was $16 per share and
               placed a value on the company at over $2 billion (double the price Bain paid).
                   Domino’s celebrated its 50th anniversary in 2010 and was awarded best pizza chain in 2010
               and 2011 by Pizza Today Magazine, marking the first time ever that the same pizza chain had
               received the award in consecutive years. Domino’s CEO Patrick Doyle was named the best CEO
               of 2011 by CNBC, the same year that Domino’s was ranked number-one in Forbes Magazine’s
               “Top 20 Franchises for the Money” list.

               Vision/Mission
               Domino's vision (paraphrased) is “to be the best place on the planet to prepare, deliver, and con-
               sume pizza.” The company’s mission statement (paraphrased) is to “have fun preparing, deliver-
               ing, and consuming pizza.” In addition to these statements, Domino’s describes itself in terms
               of its employees, united by the common goal of becoming the global leader in pizza delivery.

                                           The company’s motto in a few words are opportunity, hard work, inspired solutions, winning
                                           together, embracing community, and uncommon honesty. The reason for these special words is
                                           that nearly all Domino’s franchise owners started their careers with the firm as delivery drivers
                                           or in other in-store positions. Thousands of other Domino’s employees, including supervisors,
                                           trainers, quality auditors, international business consultants, marketers, and executives, also be-
                                           gan their careers in the stores. Domino’s core beliefs are to promote internal growth and provide
                                           opportunities for anyone willing to work hard.

                                           Organizational Structure
                                           Since there is no COO or CAO by title depicted among Domino’s top executives, the firm ap-
                                           pears to operate from a very flat divisional-by-region type design. Since the firm’s structure is
                                           portrayed neither in the firm’s Form 10K nor on the company website, perhaps only insiders
                                           know exactly who reports to who, but apparently every top executive reports to CEO Brandon.

                                           Current Strategies
                                           Perhaps Domino’s most profitable strategy is their vertically integrated supply chain where they
                                           have backward control, to some extent, over many of their supplies such as dough, veggies, equip-
                                           ment, and uniforms, and direct forward control over about 400 retail stores that are company-owned.
                                           One area where Domino’s could possibly extend their backward integration strategy would be to
                                           purchase trucks to deliver their products. Currently Domino’s leases these vehicles.
                                               Unlike Yum! Brands and other competitors who have diversified into other foods and restau-
                                           rants, Domino’s has maintained their strategy of staying focused on the Domino’s Pizza Brand.
                                           The company still offers little to nothing in terms of healthy food options on the menu other
                                           than three salad options, but offers chicken wings, sandwiches, pasta, and desserts. While this
                                           approach enables Domino’s to focus almost exclusively on pizza, this practice also increases the
                                           firm’s vulnerability to the increasingly health-minded customer and possible government man-
                                           dates for fast food restaurants to stop using certain ingredients and preservatives, and potentially
                                           forcing all restaurants to label all nutrition information on the menu at the point of sale. Such a
                                           law would not be favorable to Domino’s.
                                               Domino’s CEO desires to extend further the company’s domestic and global presence. With
                                           over 14,400 stores and more than half of those international-based, Domino’s enjoys large econo-
                                           mies of scale and brand name recognition enabling the firm to spread costs effectively. With econ-
                                           omies growing in many underdeveloped markets, Domino’s senior management estimates the
                                           company is only serving about 50 percent of the international market they should be serving, thus
                                           suggesting the firm’s plans to add an additional 5,000 internationally based stores in the coming
                                           years. Further expansion globally would increase risks as marketing research costs will be high,
                                           and trademark and patent protection laws are not as sophisticated in developing countries.

                   Domino’s derives most of its income from U.S. and Canadian markets through royalties
               and supply-chain operations—including selling equipment, food, and supplies that franchisees
               must purchase from Domino’s. In international markets, Domino’s uses the “master franchisees”
               model, where the corporation attempts to attract an investor to take on multiple Domino’s and
               gives them franchisee rights in that region. Here the master franchisee profits by sub-­franchising,
               selling ingredients and equipment, and running their own stores.
                   Domino’s attributes much of its success to an incentive-based system for franchisees where they
               actively share in profits through increasing demand for new stores and through purchasing supplies
               from the Domino’s Supply Chain. Domino’s individual franchisee stores and the over 400 company-
               owned stores also enjoy a simple and effective store layout enabling pizza delivery and carryout or-
               ders to be processed and executed efficiently as compared to many competitors. Unlike Domino’s,
               many rival pizza firms utilize a dine-in business model which is much more costly. Competitive ad-
               vantages such as these make Domino’s an attractive franchisee option in the quick-service restaurant
               (QSR) market as overhead and investment is generally cheaper than competing firms.

               Sustainability and Ethics
               Sustainability refers to the extent that an organization’s operations and actions protect, mend,
               and preserve rather than harm or destroy the natural environment. Many firms today develop
               an annual sustainability report, similar to an annual report, to reveal to stakeholders their ac-
               tions and commitment to sustainability. Domino’s combines several reports into one calling it a
               Corporate Stewardship Report. The firm has long prided itself on taking care of its employees as
               90 percent of all current owners started out working in a Domino’s. In recent years, Domino’s
               has improved its menu with an almost total revamp since 2008.
                     Today, MSG and artificial food colorings have been eliminated from all Domino’s prod-
               ucts in the United States except for where they occur naturally, like in cheese and some meats.
               Vegetables are distributed from a supply chain facility in Georgia to many U.S.-based locations.
               Having a central supply-chain location improves food safety issues as opposed to letting each
               individual store cut and prep its own veggies and meats. To better serve customers in a nutrition-
               minded society, Domino’s adds their “Cal-O-Meter” online—as customers build a pizza they
               can watch the calorie clock tick up, or tick down if they are willing to forgo an extra tasty
               ­option—such as double meat or cheese. Allergen information is also available online.
                     Domino’s uses 100 percent sustainable palm oil product for some of their items such as pan
                pizza dough, but palm oil is not used in the majority of Domino’s offerings. To ensure the oil
                used is from sustainable sources, Domino’s, in 2015, traced 100 percent of oil obtained from
                its supplier to environmentally friendly means. Like its palm oil supplier, Domino’s cardboard
                ­suppliers hold certifications with several forestry councils to ensure responsible processing of
                 trees; most pizza boxes at Domino’s are 40 to 70 percent recycled.
                     Domino’s is also a good citizen in the communities in which it operates. For over 50 years,
                 the firm has aggressively supported schools, youth sports teams, and first responders. The
                 company often provides free pizzas to first responders in times of crisis and donating free food
                 to various programs for kids. In 2016 alone, the firm donated over $8 million to communities,
                 raised over $7 million for St. Jude Children’s research hospital, and donated over 14,000 pizzas
                 as a small sampling of their philanthropic giving back to the community.

               Advertising/Sales Force
               Up until 2008, Domino’s domestic stores contributed 4 percent of all retail sales to support
               national and local advertising campaigns. However, starting in 2009, domestic stores voted to
               increase their advertising revenue contribution rate to 5 percent and eventually to 5.5 percent in
               2011, and now 6 percent heading into 2018. Domino’s expects this rate to remain unchanged for
               the foreseeable future. Much of those monies are devoted to mass mail flyers promoting specials
               at the local Domino’s.

               Domino’s income statements and balance sheets are provided in Exhibit 2 and Exhibit 3, respec-
               tively. Note the 12.75 percent increase in revenues in 2017 and the 29.45 percent increase in net

               Segment Data
               Domino’s provides financial information for four key business segments: 1) Domestic Company-
               Owned Stores, 2) Domestic Franchise Stores, 3) Domestic Supply Chain, and 4) International.
               Note in Exhibit 4 that the largest revenue-generating segment is the Domestic Supply Chain
               with over 60 percent of all revenue. Note also the large revenue numbers for the relatively few
               company-owned stores due to each Domino’s Domestic Franchisee owning his/her own store(s)
               and reporting their revenues on their own personal financial statements rather than Domino’s.
               Domino’s derives revenue from only the royalties and advertising fees they receive from
               franchisees. The financial data for the International Supply Chain Centers are included in the
               International Division, not under the Domestic Supply Chain Division.
                   Also note in Exhibit 4 revenue increases across all divisions in 2017 compared to 2016.
               Exhibit 4 reveals that even though half of the stores are internationally based, almost all reve-
               nues are derived from domestic operations. The numbers are not as abnormal as they first appear
               though. Take for example the revenue breakdown between Domestic Franchise and International
               Franchise in Exhibit 4—based on both having the same number of stores, the International
               Franchise reports 37 percent of revenues between the two divisions, a bit off from an even
               50–50, but with the master franchiser system, there is another middleman, so to speak.
                   Exhibit 5 depicts Domino’s revenues by region. Note domestic is largest, followed by supply
               chain.

               Domestic Supply Chain
               Domino’s domestic supply chain supplies franchisees with dough, vegetables, ovens, uniforms,
               and much more, enabling better control, pizza consistency, and timely delivery of products. This
               backward integration strategy enables Domino’s to offer pizza at lower prices and allows store
               managers to focus on store operations rather than mixing dough on site, prepping vegetables,
               and bargaining with independent suppliers for ingredients. Domino’s has 18 regional dough
               manufacturing and supply-chain centers and leases a fleet of over 400 trucks to aid in deliver-
               ing products to stores twice a week. Domino’s franchisees are, however, not required to pur-
               chase supplies from Domino’s, but interestingly, over 99 percent do purchase all their supplies
               from the company’s Domestic Supply Chain segment. To ensure this division remains viable,
               Domino’s provides profit-sharing incentives to franchisees to buy their products from Domino’s.
               In addition to the 18 dough manufacturing supply chains and a few other supply chains for other

                                   Domestic Stores
                                   The company’s Domestic Stores division includes a network of over 5,195 stores operated
                                   by franchisees and 392 company-owned stores in the United States. Domino’s desires to
                                   have all of their stores owned and operated by franchisees, but if certain stores are under-
                                   performing, Domino’s often will purchase these stores in hopes of turning them around and
                                   refranchising them at a later date. Domino’s also uses company-owned stores as test sites for
                                   new products, promotions, new potential store layout improvements, and for prospective new
                                   franchisees.
                                       Although the typical franchisee of Domino’s operates 4 stores, the 14 largest franchisees
                                   operate over 50 stores, including the largest domestic franchisee that operates 187 stores.
                                   Currently, Domino’s has 789 different domestic franchisees, with the average franchisee be-
                                   ing in Domino’s system for an impressive 14 years. Much of this longevity can be attributed to
                                   Domino’s requiring prospective franchisees to manage a store for one year before entering into
                                   a long-term contract with Domino’s. Domino’s feels this system is unique to the pizza industry
                                   and provides a competitive advantage over rival pizza firms.
                                       Franchise agreements require the franchisee to operate a store in a location for 10 years
                                   with the ability to renew for another 10 years with franchise renewal rates around 99 percent.
                                   Franchisees pay 5.5 percent royalty fee on sales and another 6 percent on national advertising
                                   and marketing.

                                   International Division
                                   Domino’s has operations in over 85 countries with 9,269 internationally based locations. Exhibit
                                   6 provides a breakdown of stores in the top 11 markets; the top 10 international markets account
                                   for over 64 percent of all Domino’s international stores. Note that India has the most Domino’s
                                   of all countries, followed by the UK. Just 5 years earlier, India was only third in total stores
                                   outside the United States behind both the UK and Mexico. As with domestic franchisee stores,
                                   most of the company’s revenue in the International Division comes from royalty payments and
                                   advertising, as well as the sales of food and supplies to certain markets (predominantly Canada,
                                   Alaska, and Hawaii). Domino’s aggressively attracts a master franchiser in international markets
                                   to sub-franchise out to other individuals.

               Competitors
               Pizza delivery and carry-out competition in both the United States and internationally is ex-
               tremely intense, with Pizza Hut (owned by Yum! Brands) being the largest competitor in the
               industry. Yum! Brands’ revenues are over 128 percent greater than Domino’s. Papa John’s and
               Little Caesars are also fierce rivals in the industry. In addition to the three main rivals of Pizza
               Hut, Papa Johns, and Little Caesars, Domino’s faces intense competition from thousands of
               ­local mom-and-pop pizza stores, frozen pizzas from the grocery store, as well as hundreds of
                non-pizza fast food options.
                    Exhibit 7 provides a quick comparative analysis of Domino’s with two rival firms. Note that
                Yum! Brands is three times the size of Domino’s, but Domino’s is nearly five times the size of
                Papa John’s from a market capitalization perspective.
                    Internationally, Pizza Hut and Domino’s are the main companies in the industry, but most
                countries also have thousands of mom-and-pop pizza and Italian restaurants. As with the do-
                mestic market, some customers consider local pizza stores to offer better quality products than
                large chains and are willing to pay marginally higher prices for this perceived quality. Another
                competitor is RAVE Restaurant Group, owner of Pizza Inn, based in The Colony, Texas. RAVE
                owns and franchises out more than 300 Pizza Inn and Five Pie Pizza stores in the United States
                and Internationally.

                                   Crust, Hand-Tossed, and Sicilian. Other menu items include pasta, salads, and sandwiches.
                                   Pizza Huts offer dine-in service at their famous red-roofed restaurants, as well as carryout and
                                   delivery service. About 15 percent of all Pizza Huts are company-operated while the remaining
                                   stores are franchised. The world’s largest fast food company, Yum! Brands also owns and oper-

                                   Papa John’s International, Inc. (PZZA)
                                   Headquartered in Louisville, Kentucky, and founded in 1985, Papa John’s operates 5,097 pizza
                                   restaurants, with 4,456 of these being franchisee-owned and 743 being company-owned stores.
                                   Total restaurants have increased over 30 percent from year-end 2012 through 2017. Papa John’s
                                   has restaurants in all 50 U.S. states and 44 foreign markets. The company currently has 16,500
                                   full-time employees and markets their pizza under the slogan “Better ingredients, better pizza.”
                                   The company reported revenue of over $1.7 billion for year-end 2017 with net income of $102
                                   million. Papa John’s carries $85 million in Goodwill on their balance sheet.
                                       Papa John’s offers several different pizza styles and topping choices, as well as a few spe-
                                   cialty pies such as The Works and The Meats. Papa John’s stores typically offer delivery and car-
                                   ryout service only. The company announced in 2018 that it was reducing its formal partnership
                                   with the NFL over founder and Chairman John Schnatter’s comments on players’ rights to stand
                                   or not stand at games during the playing of the U.S. National Anthem.

                                   RAVE Restaurant Group
                                   RAVE owns Pizza Inn and Pie Five Pizza. The latter two are a relatively small chain of fran-
                                   chised quick-service pizza restaurants, with more than 300 locations in the United States and
                                   the Middle East. Pizza Inns offer pizzas, pastas, and sandwiches, along with salads and desserts.
                                   Most locations offer buffet-style and table service, while other units are strictly delivery and
                                   carryout units. The chain also has limited-menu express carryout units in convenience stores
                                   and airport terminals, and on college campuses. Pizza Inn’s domestic locations are concentrated
                                   in more than 15 Southern states, with about half located in Texas and North Carolina. The firm
                                   has struggled in recent years with flat revenues from fiscal 2015 through 2017, hovering around
                                   only $55 million. Net losses of $1.2 million in 2015 have swollen to over $12 million in 2017.

                                   Little Caesars
                                   Headquartered in Detroit, Michigan, and privately held, Little Caesars is famous for its advertis-
                                   ing slogan, “Pizza! Pizza!” which was introduced in 1979. The phrase refers to two pizzas being
                                   offered for the comparable price of a single pizza by competitors. In November 2010, Little
                                   Caesars introduced Pizza! Pizza! Pantastic, denying that the return of “Pizza! Pizza!” had any
                                   relationship to the recent success of Domino’s. Little Caesars operates under its parent Little
                                   Caesars Enterprises and is estimated to be the third largest pizza chain in the United States,
                                   along with Papa Johns. Little Caesars operates in 30 foreign countries and has over 5,460 loca-
                                   tions that are both franchised and company-owned.
                                        Little Caesars is building a new $150 million, nine-story, 234,000 square foot, world head-

                                   modate the company’s rapid global growth and hiring. Little Caesars claims to be the largest
                                   ­carryout-only pizza chain in the world with a presence in all 50 states and 20 international
                                    markets. The company recently opened franchises in Dominican Republic, Costa Rica, and
                                    Panama with additional expansion taking place worldwide. Little Caesars attracts and continues
                                    to look for highly capable franchisee candidates for new market opportunities domestically and
                                    throughout the world.

                                   Nutrition Concerns
                                   An area of concern for all fast food establishments, including pizza stores, is the growing
                                   health-minded customer, as well as the growing pressure from government agencies to label all
                                   products with nutrition information. There have been battles between the restaurant industry

               and government agencies for many years, much like the tobacco industry (in respect to labeling
               their products). It appears the war is close to being lost for the restaurant industry. Domino’s
               itemizes nutrition information on their website. After doing the calculations, one large slice of
               hand-tossed pepperoni pizza, for example, has 300 calories and 12 grams of fat, and there are 8
               slices in a pizza. To complicate matters for restaurants such as Domino’s, it is difficult to provide
               accurate nutrition labels when there can be an almost endless combination of ingredients on a
               pizza. For example, someone may order a large sausage pizza with onions and olives whereas
               someone else might order extra cheese and tomatoes. Having to print out nutrition labels for all
               these combinations would be quite costly, as opposed to a restaurant like McDonald’s where
               they can print the nutrition label on the Big Mac as there is uniformity in ingredients and the
               label is understood to be for the base item.
                    To complicate matters for the QSR industry as a whole, many lawmakers want to force nutri-
               tion information to be included on the menu at the point of sale, and there is still a debate in the
               United States regarding whether each state could/should enact their own nutrition guidelines or
               if there will be a national mandate/standard. Further spearheading the government’s position,
               there have been several recent lawsuits where plaintiffs sought monetary damages in respect
               to advertising to children and obesity in children derived from eating fast food. As the United
               States (and world) population becomes more health conscious and more litigious, it seems evi-
               table that detailed nutrition and possibly even warning labels similar to those in the tobacco in-
               dustry will appear on some products and menus. In addition, lawsuits and governments are also
               encouraging the elimination of trans fats (and other harmful products) that are still present in the
               cheese on a Domino’s pizza, and many other pizzas.
                    Chipotle Mexican Grill claims to only use meat and dairy products from free-ranging cattle,
               as opposed to cattle injected with growth hormones. Domino’s Pizza markets their pizzas as hav-
               ing gluten-free crust. These are attempts to win over health-conscious customers, comply with
               government regulations, and make current customers feel a little less guilty about eating pizza.
               The tug of war between customers, governments, lawyers, and the restaurant industry on health
               issues is likely to continue for some time.
                    In response to these challenges, many restaurants have opted for healthy menu options.
               Wendy’s, for example, has promoted several meal combinations that contain less than 10 grams
               of fat. All of these items were originally on its menu, just not marketed in that manner. Wendy’s
               has added side salads and fruit to help cut down on calories, fat, and sodium. Subway is also
               famous for marketing their products as healthy alternatives to other fast food options. Domino’s,
               and many pizza competitors, offer few to no menu options for the health-conscious consumer.

               Demographic Issues
               Some analysts say there are too many restaurants in the United States to be supported by the
               population. Currently, there are around 1 million fast food service locations in the United States,
               or 1 for about every 330 people. With people looking for cheaper and healthier options, it is
               difficult to determine just how many restaurants are too many. As businesses increasingly use
               business analytics to better determine potential restaurant locations, it will be interesting to see if
               the net total number of restaurants in the United States increases or declines in the coming years.
               Domino’s for example plans to continue to add restaurants, but they target mainly college cam-
               puses, shopping malls, and other high-traffic areas of their core customer base, while eliminating
               stores in unproductive areas, and also are expanding internationally heavily.

               Barriers to Entry
               Barriers to entry are relatively low for the restaurant industry, but rivalry (competitiveness)
               among firms is exceptionally high. One large contributing factor for the low barriers to entry is
               many small entrepreneurs can open mom-and-pop establishments and bypass the franchise fees,
               royalties, selection process, etc. of owning a franchised restaurant and lease an existing build-
               ing relatively cheap. However, even avoiding high-fixed costs, variable costs are often high, and
               small-scale entrepreneurs are not able to compete with larger franchise stores who can better
               negotiate pricing on food, packaging, and other supplies. In the QSR industry, the bargaining
               power of consumers is quite powerful, availability of restaurant options in most places is abun-
               dant, and consequently, there is intense price competitiveness among rival firms. Even if you are
               sure you want pizza for lunch or dinner, you likely have many options.

    480    STRATEGIC-MANAGEMENT CASE ANALYSIS

                                   Economic Factors
                                   The current landscape in the Quick Service Restaurant (QSR) business is a bimodal population
                                   distribution with a large population of bargain-minded customers seeking deals on less expen-
                                   sive, fast food options, and another population of more affluent consumers targeting middle- to
                                   higher-end restaurants. Domino’s is well positioned strategically to target the first group of
                                   consumers as there are many more of them; Domino’s often has excellent sales and discounts to
                                   target this group.
                                       Among the subset of customers who are value shoppers, many of these are also shoppers of
                                   quality and are willing to wait in line a little longer or pay a little more for better quality food
                                   products. Domino’s has capitalized on this very well recently with the introduction of their
                                   Artisan pizzas, and new recipes (or higher-quality products) for their crust, sauce, and cheeses.
                                   In addition, Domino’s offers many pick-up specials. While pick-up may be an inconvenience
                                   over delivery, many customers in today’s climate are willing to tolerate a degree of inconve-
                                   nience if they can get a better deal.
                                       Similar to Domino’s, many restaurant owners in the fast food industry have experienced
                                   stronger growth in their international markets than in domestic markets. This trend is expected to
                                   continue, especially in China and other developing nations, as many American fast food options
                                   are still novel, even in Europe.

                                   Global Issues
                                   The fast food restaurant industry has been rapidly expanding overseas for the last 20 years and is
                                   expected to continue to do so in the foreseeable future. Domino’s, for example, has over half of
                                   their store locations overseas and Yum! Brands generated over 60 percent of their revenue from
                                   overseas markets.
                                       Expanding into global markets presents problems such as exchange rate fluctuations, diet of
                                   local consumers, securing permits, possible anti-American association with U.S. brands, collect-
                                   ing royalties from foreign operations, supply and distribution issues, currency valuation issues,
                                   and even language barriers are all potential threats of operating overseas. In addition, securing
                                   fresh food products in a timely manner may be difficult, as most franchises based in the United
                                   States have backward integrated supply chains providing better control over supplies.
                                       Expanding across countries also increases the risk of not being able to protect intellectual
                                   property as well as desired. Trademark protection and registration, patents, dilution, and unfair
                                   competition are all risks associated with developing markets that are not as problematic in more
                                   developed markets. In the United States, most fast food restaurants are aimed at lower income
                                   people who wish for a quick and easy drive-though meal. However, in contrast, in many de-
                                   veloping markets, while still offering virtually the same menu as in the United States, the fast
                                   food industry is geared more to the middle class and a sit down dine-in experience, much like a
                                   Buffalo Wild Wings, Moe’s Southwest Grill, or TGI Fridays would be in the United States. In
                                   general, the overall décor and ambience in international fast food establishments tends to be a bit
                                   nicer than the United States counterparts.

                                   Future
                                   In February 2018, Domino’s launched its oven-baked sandwiches, but only in Australia.
                                   Domino’s CEO of Australia and New Zealand operations says the fillings were chosen to include
                                   “on-trend” ingredients such as avocado and kale-slaw. There are four flavors to choose from and
                                   each sandwich costs $5.95.
                                       Almost as soon as Papa John’s ended its sponsorship agreement with the NFL over differing
                                   beliefs, Pizza Hut was named as the official pizza sponsor of the NFL. The Pizza Hut sponsor-
                                   ship began with the 2018 NFL Draft. Papa John’s is focusing on each of the 22 NFL teams sepa-
                                   rately now, rather than marketing to the league as a whole.
                                       With up to a million or more restaurants selling pizza every day across the world, Domino’s
                                   needs a clear strategic plan moving forward. The company is doing well now, but doing well
                                   today is not a guarantee to do well tomorrow, so diligence is required and needed.

               www.1800petmeds.com, PETS
               Headquartered in Delray Beach, Florida, PetMed Express is a licensed online pharmacy that
               fills prescriptions written by veterinarians. The company has over 9 million satisfied customers
               and dispenses drugs only in the United States. The company competes with local veterinarians,
               many of whom make money selling drugs for pets. PetMed carries all the medications sold in
               veterinarian offices. The company says it employs the largest number of veterinary pharmacists
               in the world. The company has a history of legal problems with veterinaries across the country
               undercutting their prices and other related concerns. PetMed does not disclose where it obtains
               its pet drugs and this fact irritates many veterinarians.
                    PetMed Express is America’s largest pet pharmacy, delivering prescription and non-
               prescription pet medications and other health products for small animals at competitive prices
               direct to consumers through its 1-800-PetMeds toll-free number and on the Internet through its
               corporate website. The company’s fiscal 2017 year ended March 31, 2017. For the company’s
               Q3 2018 that ended December 3, 2017, new order sales increased 15.5 percent, new income
               increased 88 percent, and revenues increased 13.7 percent—so PetMed is doing well. In January
               2018, the company’s board of directors increased the firm’s dividend by 25 percent from $0.20
               to $0.25 per share paid on February 16, 2018.
                    PetMed markets prescription and non-prescription pet medications, as well as health prod-
               ucts and supplies for small animals to retail customers. A sampling of the company’s products
               include flea and tick control products, bone and joint care products, vitamins, treats, nutritional
               supplements, hygiene products, and supplies; and prescription medications, including heart-
               worm preventatives, flea and tick preventatives, arthritis, thyroid, diabetes, pain medications,
               antibiotics, and other specialty medications, as well as generic substitutes. PetMed also sells
               food, beds, crates, stairs, strollers, and other pet supplies through its website, direct mail, and its
               toll-free number. It markets its products through Internet; telephone contact center; and direct
               mail/print through 1-800-PetMeds catalogs, brochures, and postcards under various brands.

               History
               PetMed was founded in 1996 by Marc Puleo. The company got off to a rocky start. In 1999, the
               company settled charges with the Florida Pharmacy Board for selling drugs that did not have
               prescriptions, false advertising, poor record keeping, and not labeling drugs correctly. As part of
               the settlement, the company paid a fine but also agreed to send its pharmacists for further educa-
               tion, agreed to random inspections, and agreed to provide regular reports to the board.
                   In 2002, PetMed was fined by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) for sell-
               ing drugs marked with metric doses—the drugs that were made by Novartis for sale in
               Europe and Australia. PetMed is exclusively a U.S. firm and the doses and labeling were not
               FDA-approved—Novartis sued PetMed for damages. In 2002, PetMed was charged by the
               Florida Pharmacy Board for contracting with veterinarians to write prescriptions for animals
               they had never examined, and for selling animals drugs that had not been approved by the FDA.
               In the same year, the company settled similar charges in Ohio. Also in 2002, the pharmacy board
               in Texas filed a lawsuit charging PetMed Express with dispensing veterinary drugs without
               prescriptions. The case was settled in 2006.
                   Even as late as August 2017, PetMed has legal problems as the Rosen Law Firm filed a class
               action lawsuit against the company alleging that PetMed was marketing dangerous and addictive
               animal drugs to humans. As a result of this action, Google may halt PetMed’s advertising and
               business operations with that firm.

                                             Vision/Mission
                                             PetMed Express appears to not have a vision or mission statement provided at the corporate
                                             website or in the company’s Annual Report.

                                             Customers and Advertising
                                             PetMed says 2.3 million customers purchased from the company in fiscal 2016 and 2017,
                                             and that about 50 percent of those customers reside in California, New York, Pennsylvania,
                                             North Carolina, Virginia, and Georgia. The company dispenses drugs across the United States.
                                             The company obtained 514,000 new customers during fiscal 2017, compared to 489,000 new
                                             ­customers from the prior year.
                                                  As a percent of revenue, the company’s advertising expenses were 7.1 and 9.3 percent, respec-
                                              tively, for fiscal 2017 and 2016. In fiscal 2017, the company eliminated all television advertising.

                                             Employees
                                             PetMed has about 190 full-time employees, including 105 in marketing, 43 in pharmacy, 3 in
                                             information technology, 3 in administrative positions, and 5 top managers.

                                             Organizational Structure
                                             Based on the titles of their corporate executives, it appears that PetMed operates from a f­ unctional
                                             organizational structure with no divisions. The company is quite light on top executives and no
                                             one appears to head up potential segments, such as prescription versus n­ on-prescription, online
                                             versus traditional, or pharmaceutical versus other.

               were up due to increased new order sales, which increased 15.5 percent, and reorder sales,
               which increased 13.4 percent. Net income for the Q3 2018 quarter was $9.1 million, com-
               pared to net income of $4.8 million the previous year same quarter, an 88 percent increase.
               Net income for the 9 months ended December 31, 2017 was $27.1 million, compared to
               net income of $16.3 million, for the 9 months the prior fiscal year, a 66 income increase
               to net income. Average order size increased to $86 for the Q3 2018 quarter, compared to
               $81 for the same quarter in the prior year. Also for the company’s Q3 2018 quarter, on-
               line sales increased 15.0 percent to $50.4 million from $43.8 million for the same period
               the prior year, and were approximately 84 percent of all sales, compared to 83 percent for
               the same quarter the prior year. The company’s Q3 2018 was the fourth consecutive quarter
               of increasing both new order and reorder sales.
                    In January 2018, the company’s board of directors declared and increased the quarterly divi-
               dend by 25 percent from $0.20 to $0.25 per share on the firm’s common stock. The dividend was
               paid on February 16, 2018.
                    PetMed Express beat profit estimates again in its Q4 2018 that ended 3-31-18. For Q4 2018,
               the company reported net income of $10.2 million, up from $7.5 million in the year-earlier
               ­period. Sales rose to $67.3 million from $63.0 million. Also for that Q4, the company’s margins
                rose to 37 percent from 35.1 percent, boosted by a product mix shift to higher margin items.
                Additionally, for Q4 2018, PetMed’s average order value was $89 compared to $86 for the same
                quarter the prior year.

                                   Eight companies in particular generate sales in the billions for animal pharmaceuticals: Zoetis,
                                   Merck Animal Health, Merial, Elanco Animal Health, Bayer Animal Health, Boehringer
                                   Ingelheim Animal Health, Novartis Animal Health, and Virbac. However, arguably two of
                                   PetMed’s major rivals are Kroger and Walmart. Both firms fill animal prescriptions.
                                        Headquartered in Parsippany-Troy Hills, New Jersey, Zoetis develops vaccines, parasiti-
                                   cides, anti-infectives, medicinal feed additives and drugs for pain, s​ edation, and cancers for pets
                                   and farm animals. The company has annual sales of $5 billion. The company name has its root
                                   in “zo”, familiar in words such as zoo and zoology and derived from zoetic, meaning “pertaining
                                   to life.” About 60 percent of Zoetis sales come from farm animal products and 40 percent from
                                   companion animal products, mainly medicines and vaccines.
                                        Headquartered in Kenilworth, New Jersey, Merck Animal Health manufactures vaccines,
                                   anti-infective and anti-parasitic drugs, fertility management drugs, and other specialty pharma-

                      Headquartered in Ingelheim am Rhein, Germany, Boehringer Ingelheim Animal Health
               ­markets biologicals, vaccines, pharmaceuticals, and other care products for use in pets and
                livestock. Boehringer owns Merial that develops and markets veterinary products including
                anesthetics, antiparasitics, antimicrobials, and gastrointestinal, respiratory, and cardiovascular
                medicines. It also produces vaccines for livestock, poultry, and pets.
                      Headquartered in Leverkusen, Germany, Bayer HealthCare Animal Health manufactures
                antimicrobials, parasiticides, sedatives, pain killers, and nutritional supplements and feed
                ­
                ­additives for dogs, cats, and horses. Products for food animals include anti-infectives, vaccines,
                 parasiticides, sedatives, and pain killers.
                      Headquartered in Basel, Switzerland, Novartis Animal Health develops and markets health
                 product for companion animals, livestock, and the aquaculture market. Popular products include
                 treatments for dermatitis, flea protection, pain and heartworm prevention in pets, and antibiotics
                 and antiparasitics in farm animals. Novartis also developed some of the first vaccines for combating
                 viral and parasitic infections in fish. Novartis was acquired by Eli Lilly in 2015 for $5.4 billion.
                      Headquartered in Carros, France, Virbac Group manufactures antibiotics, vaccines, antipara-
                 sitics, dermatological, and dental products for the treatment and care of pets and food animals.
                      Although the companies mentioned above are competitors to PetMed, including Kroger
                 and Walmart, two other companies are major pet pharmacy rivals. They are PetIQ and Heska
                 Corporation, even though as of right now neither sell drugs direct to consumers; they only sell to
                 vets or businesses, but that could change anytime.

               company develops, manufactures, and sells pet medications, and health and wellness products
               for dogs and cats in the United States, Canada, and Europe. PetIQ is quite similar to PetMed
               Express in offering pet prescription medications, including products for arthritis, thyroid, and
               diabetes and pain treatments, as well as heartworm preventatives, antibiotics, and other specialty
               medications; over-the-counter medications and supplies, such as flea and tick control products
               in various forms comprising spot-on treatments, chewables, and collars; and health and wellness
               products consisting of specialty treats and other pet products, which include dental treats and
               nutritional supplements. Various PetIQ trade names include PetAction, Advecta, PetLock, Heart

               through wholesale distributors and retail stores in mass, club, grocery, pharmacy, and online. In
               January 2018, PetIQ acquired Community Veterinary Clinics, LLC d/b/a VIP Petcare (“VIP”), a
               leading operator and provider of nationwide veterinary clinics and veterinarian services within
               ­major U.S. retailers. VIP is now a wholly-owned subsidiary of PetIQ. VIP has its national footprint
                in the veterinarian services and products industry. As evidenced by this acquisition, PetIQ is rapidly
                growing, executing upon its mission (paraphrased) “to enhance pet lives by educating pet parents on
                the basics of veterinary care and veterinary-recommended pet products and services.”
                     VIP Petcare has a nationwide network of community clinics and wellness centers that deliver
                high value pet preventive and wellness veterinary services to all pet owners.

                                   As the year 2018 begins, worldwide sales of animal vaccines, medicines, and medical devices
                                   exceeds $8 billion annually with an additional $14 billion in sales of vaccines and medicines for
                                   livestock. An industry trade group named Animal Health Institute reports that the global market
                                   for animal medicines is about one-fortieth of that spent on human medicines. The trade group
                                   ­estimated that today “24 billion chickens, more than 1 billion cattle and sheep, 750 million pigs
                                    and goats, 500 million dogs and 400 million cats” worldwide benefit from innovations in animal
                                    health.
                                        Animal health drugs dispensed in the United States require approval from the Food and Drug
                                    Administration (FDA). According to the Animal Health Institute, the development of a new ani-
                                    mal drug can take up to 10 years and cost up to $100 million prior to approval. A new vaccine
                                    takes 3 to 5 years to develop and averages around $80 million in costs. Animal health product
                                    manufacturers support the FDA approval process through user fees authorized by the Animal
                                    Drug User Fees Act (ADUF) and the Animal Generic Drug User Fee Act.
                                        The American Pet Products Manufacturers Association says pet spending in the United
                                    States increased 10.7 percent to $66.9 billion in 2016. Among that total, pet supplies and medi-
                                    cations comprised 22 percent, or $14.7 billion. PetMed Express says the pet medication market
                                    they target is worth about $4.3 billion in annual sales. According to the company’s 2017 Form
                                    10K, the dog and cat population in the United States is about 184 million, with about 68 percent
                                    of all households having a pet.
                                        There are numerous facts and figures related to pet ownership worldwide, but simply focus-
                                    ing on the United States as PetMed does. Exhibit 6 provides some relevant information for per-
                                    forming an external strategic management assessment.

               Future
               In the first two months of 2018, shares of PedMed stock declined 10 percent, even though the
               company’s earnings per share (EPS) were $.44 for Q3 of fiscal 2018, up 83.3 percent from the
               year-ago quarter’s $.24. That year-over-year rise in earnings was accompanied by company sales
               in Q3 2018 rising 13.7 percent year-over-year to $60.1 million. Also, for Q3 2018, PedMed’s
               reorder sales increased 13.4 percent to $50.9 million, while new order sales rose 15.5 percent to
               $9.2 million. The company’s average order value was $86 in Q3, compared with $81 in the year-
               ago quarter. There is seasonality in the company’s business because of the proportion of flea,
               tick, and heartworm medications in the product mix. Spring and summer are considered peak
               seasons while fall and winter represent off-seasons. Also, during Q3 2018, PetMed acquired
               106,000 new customers, up from 99,000 a year ago. Roughly, 84 percent of all orders was gen-
               erated from its website (versus 83% in the prior-year quarter). Finally, for Q3, the company’s
               advertising expenses rose 30.2 percent to $4.1 million. Given the excellent Q3 results, PetMed
               announced a 25 percent increase in quarterly dividend to $.25 cents per share that was paid to
               shareholders in March 2018.
                   PetMed is performing quite well, but this success gives incentive for manufacturers of pet
               medications to forward integrate into PetMed’s business, potentially crushing PetMed. The com-
               pany needs a clear strategic plan going forward.

                                   AstraZeneca plc—2022

                                   www.astrazeneca.com
                                   Headquartered in Cambridge, England, AstraZeneca plc is a huge pharmaceutical firm that
                                   focuses on oncology, cardiovascular disease, renal and metabolism disorders, respiratory dis-
                                   orders, immunology, and several other areas. It employs 76,100 persons, up from 70,000 and
                                   64,000 in 2019 and 2018, respectively. In 2021, the company had 171 projects in its pipeline,
                                   with 12 considered as in the late stage.
                                       Global populations are shifting toward older age groups, spurring a greater need for advanced
                                   medical care. People in developing regions have more disposable income and are increasingly
                                   able to pay for advanced medical care. In fact, 34 percent of AstraZeneca’s sales in 2020 were
                                   derived from emerging markets. COVID-19 is still fresh in everyone’s minds. With today’s tech-
                                   nology and advanced data analytics, drugs can be tailored for specific customers. Such trends are
                                   increasing competition among pharmaceutical firms.

                                   History
                                   AstraZeneca traces its origins to the 1890s, when a group of pharmacists in Sweden proposed
                                   that pharmaceuticals be produced on an industrial scale as opposed to pharmacists (often called
                                   chemists) producing drugs locally. In 1913, Astra AB was formally incorporated and quickly
                                   became a leading pharmaceutical firm in Sweden. AstraZeneca was founded in 1999 when the
                                   Swedish firm Astra AB merged with the British Zeneca Group.
                                       AstraZeneca reported goodwill of over $11 billion in 2020, indicating a history of paying
                                   more than book value for acquisitions. (Note that whenever a firm pays more than the stock price
                                   times the number of shares outstanding for a rival firm, then the overpaid amount is referred to
                                   as goodwill and is recorded on the acquiring firm’s balance sheet.) Sometimes a company will
                                   pay more than book value to obtain certain patents, trademarks, or technologies. AstraZeneca
                                   acquired Cambridge Antibody Technology in 2006, Medimmune in 2007, Spirogen in 2013,
                                   Definiens in 2014, and Alexion Pharmaceuticals in 2020.
                                       AstraZeneca has a strong history of employing women, as evidenced by over 50 percent of the
                                   company’s workforce being female. The firm also has a strong history with sustainability-related
                                   issues; it is a member of several sustainability indices, including the Dow Jones Sustainability
                                   Index, FTSE4Good, and the Access to Medicine Index. AstraZeneca produced a successful vac-
                                   cine for COVID-19 in late 2020.

                                   Vision/Mission
                                   AstraZeneca does not have a stated vision or mission statement. However, paraphrased from
                                   narrative on the corporate website and the company’s 2020 Annual Report, the following could
                                   function as AstraZeneca’s vision and mission statements.

                                   Vision Statement
                                   We are committed to becoming the global leader in providing life-changing medicines through
                                   science and the entrepreneurial spirit of our employees.

                                   Mission Statement
                                   At AstraZeneca, we serve people around the world to provide health solutions that increase the
                                   quality of life of all we serve. Focused on producing ethical drugs and financial growth, we
                                   are committed to using the latest technology and hiring the most talented scientists and busi-
                                   ness professionals. Our core areas of service are oncology, cardiovascular, renal and metabolism,
                                   and respiratory diseases. With respect to oncology, we are determined to find a cure for every
                                   cancer known to man. By focusing on sustainability and environmental protection, we are also
                                   committed to operating in a manner that balances business growth with preserving the natural
                                   environment.

               Internal Issues
               Organizational Structure
               AstraZeneca is proud to have a workforce that is 50.5 percent female. However, the company’s
               senior executive team has only 4 women out of 12 team members, and the board of directors has
               5 f­ emale members out of 14 members.
                     The firm’s structure features one major team referred to as the Senior Executive Team (SET)
               and two governance bodies that make key decisions related to the business portfolios and pipe-
               line. One team is called the Early Stage Portfolio Committee (ESPC), and the other is called the
               Late Stage Portfolio Committee. Members of the SET are provided below. It is difficult to figure
               out exactly how the firm is structured, but considering consumption habits of drugs are likely
               similar across geographic regions, a new organizational structure with presidents of the four key
               segments should perhaps be considered.
                     AstraZeneca’s top executives are listed below:
                1.    Pascal Soriot, CEO
                2.    Marc Dunoyer, CFO
                3.    Katarina Ageborg, Executive Vice President, Sustainability and Chief Compliance Officer
                4.    Jose Baselga, Executive Vice President, Oncology R&D
                5.    Pam Cheng, Executive Vice President, Operations & Information Technology
                6.    Ruud Dobber, Executive Vice President, BioPharmaceuticals Business Unit
                7.    David Fredrickson, Executive Vice President, Oncology Business Unit
                8.    Menelas Pangalos, Executive Vice President, Biopharmaceuticals R&D
                9.    Jeff Pott, General Counsel and Chief Human Resources Officer
               10.    Iskra Reic, Executive Vice President, Europe and Canada
               11.    Leon Wang, Executive Vice President, International and China President
               12.    Fiona Cicconi, Executive Vice President, Human Resources

               Financial Data and Statements
               As indicated in Exhibit 1, AstraZeneca reported revenue growth of 9 percent in fiscal 2020 but
               a 156 percent net income growth due in large part to controlling the cost of goods sold expenses
               and a slight reduction in operating expenses. In Exhibit 2, note the large amount of goodwill
               on the balance sheet from purchasing rival firms in excess of book value and the large intan-
               gibles number. Intangibles are common for firms such as AstraZeneca as they indicate patents. In
               December 2020, AstraZeneca agreed to acquire Alexion Pharmaceuticals for $39 billion in part
               because of the firm’s desire to report revenues of $40 billion by 2023. Note the goodwill on the
               2021 balance sheet once the acquisition is finalized; just how much will AstraZeneca overpay for
               Alexion? Don’t be misled by large increases in revenues or net income in fiscal 2021, as they will
               largely be derived from this merger.

                                   R&D Information
                                   Research and development (R&D) activities and expenditures are the backbone of virtually all
                                   pharmaceutical firms. R&D is a major expense at AstraZeneca. The company markets itself as
                                   focusing on quality rather than quantity with its R&D through its 5R Framework strategy. Over
                                   the period from 2015 to 2020, the 5R Framework aided the firm in advancing the former propor-
                                   tion of pipeline molecules by four times. The basis of the 5R Framework is 1) selecting the right
                                   targets that have a significant correlation with the disease under concern, 2) assuring new drugs
                                   more effectively target the correct tissues, 3) ensuring that safety is high before beginning clini-
                                   cal trials, 4) ensuring the right markets are chosen based on the value propositions of the right-
                                   size target markets, and 5) ensuring that drugs are tailored more closely to individual patients.
                                       Typically, the average success rate for small molecule (virus) research is 6 percent, but through
                                   the 5R Framework, AstraZeneca has been able to advance its Phase III clinical trials from 4 to 19
                                   percent, well above the 6 percent average. For example, implementing just Step 5 above enabled
                                   the launch of 9 companion diagnostics tests over a 5-year period ending in 2016, compared to only
                                   1 companion diagnostics test launched between 2005 and 2010. Notable areas of these diagnostics
                                   included lung cancer, ovarian cancer, and bladder cancer. For the patient, a diagnostic test is much

               more cost effective, time saving, and less invasive than a traditional biopsy. The test is often pos-
               sible with just a simple prick of the finger.
                    To further benefit from R&D investments, AstraZeneca routinely partners with leading uni-
               versities and research laboratories, enabling AstraZeneca scientists to work with the world’s
               best researchers and scientists in joint partnerships. This open innovation initiative benefits not
               only AstraZeneca but also the world at large. The firm spent $6 billion on R&D in both 2019
               and 2020.
                    The general phases of R&D projects is 5 to 15 years, with a 6-step sequence: 1) identify
               medicines that will have a positive impact; 2) initiate preclinical studies; 3) conduct Phase I tri-
               als, which includes trials with health volunteers to determine dosage and side effects; 4) Phase II
               trials, which expand on Phase I trials, and where the sample size of volunteers are increased and
               further data is collected for regulatory approvals; 5) Phase III trials, where larger sample sizes
               are used and a branding strategy for the drug is determined; and 6) regulatory submission and
               pricing. These R&D phases are followed by a launch phase that could last another 5 to 15 years.

               By-Segment Information
               AstraZeneca conducts business in four key segments: 1) Oncology, 2) Cardiovascular, Renal
               & Metabolism, 3) Respiratory & Immunology, and 4) Other Medicines. Exhibit 3 shows that
               Oncology is the largest division, with 42 percent of sales in 2020, and the fastest-growing divi-
               sion, with sales up a remarkable 80 percent since 2018. The weakest division is Other Medicines,
               representing only 10 percent of total revenue, and with sales down 24 percent since 2018.

               Oncology
               Exhibit 3 shows that oncology, the branch of medicine that specializes in cancer, is the most prof-
               itable and fastest-growing segment at AstraZeneca. The firm claims their mission is to discover
               and provide a cure for every type of cancer known to man. This segment has grown 80 percent
               since 2018 and represents 42 percent of all sales. Globally, cancer is the second leading cause
               of deaths. Lung cancer has the highest mortality rate, taking a life every 18 seconds, and is fol-
               lowed by colorectal, stomach, liver, and breast cancer. The two most common types of cancer
               worldwide are lung and breast cancer. Prostate and ovarian are other common cancers for which
               AstraZeneca specializes in finding cures and medical treatment.

                                   this market (less than 8 percent), leaving substantial room for growth. Tagrisso, AstraZeneca’s drug
                                   for lung cancer, has been approved in the United States and in 85 other countries. Sales of this drug
                                   were up 36 percent in 2020, with revenues of $4.3 billion. Lynparza is a drug that can treat ovarian,
                                   breast, pancreatic, and prostate cancers, and it accounted for $2.2 billion in sales, up 24 percent from
                                   2019. This drug is approved in 78 countries for ovarian cancer but only in 55 countries for pancreatic
                                   cancer. This discrepancy calls to attention the heavy regulation in this industry, as many of the same
                                   countries that approve drugs for some cancers do not approve the same drug for other cancers.
                                       Imfinzi, which is used to treat both lung and bladder cancer, experienced an increase in sales
                                   of 39 percent to $2 billion in 2020; it is approved in 67 countries. While AstraZeneca has many
                                   other drugs, these three drugs account for 79 percent of 2020 revenues for the oncology divi-
                                   sion. New regulation, patent expiration, and piracy of any one of these three drugs are all serious
                                   threats for AstraZeneca moving forward. The firm has numerous other products in the pipeline
                                   waiting approval, but careful strategic planning is needed because of expiring patents on the
                                   same drugs that treat these common types of cancers. Recall from earlier that AstraZeneca only
                                   controls 7.7 percent of the oncology market.

                                   Cardiovascular, Renal, & Metabolism
                                   The mission of this business segment is to protect people from cardiovascular, renal, and me-
                                   tabolism (CVRM) diseases. The CVRM market is estimated to be over $204 billion worldwide,
                                   with AstraZeneca controlling $7 billion of it, or 3.4 percent. Globally, diabetes represents $100
                                   billion of the $204 billion world market in CVRM, with high blood pressure and blood choles-
                                   terol accounting for $35 and $17 billion, respectively. In total, 463 million people worldwide live
                                   with diabetes, and 18 million people die from heart failure and cardiovascular disease annually.
                                   About 700 million people live with chronic kidney disease. Similar to oncology, a few drugs
                                   comprise most of the revenue for AstraZeneca in this division.
                                        Farxigal is approved in 100 countries and is used to treat both Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes.
                                   The reported revenue for the drug was nearly $2 billion in 2020, up 27 percent from 2019.
                                   Brilinta, which treats coronary artery disease and stroke, is approved in 110 countries and re-
                                   ported revenues of $1.5 billion in 2020, but it was up only 1 percent from 2019. The third and
                                   fourth most profitable drugs in this segment for AstraZeneca both had revenues around $500
                                   million but were down 11 and 18 percent in 2020. With flat sales over 3 years in an important di-
                                   vision, AstraZeneca needs a clear strategic plan to determine what direction this division should
                                   take, as the data indicates that unless something changes, the entire division’s growth predomi-
                                   nately hinges on just Farxigal.

                                   Respiratory & Immunology
                                   The annual worldwide market value for this segment is projected to be $72 billion, with asthma
                                   accounting for $22 billion and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) accounting for
                                   $17 billion. AstraZeneca accounted for $5.3 billion of this $72 billion industry, which forecast-
                                   ers quickly see growing into a $100 billion industry. Globally, 339 million people suffer from
                                   asthma, and 60 percent of the cases are considered uncontrolled. COPD is the third leading cause
                                   of death in the world, with over 384 million people suffering annually. AstraZeneca has three
                                   leading asthma drugs that represent about $4.6 billion of the firm’s $5.3 billion in sales. Overall,
                                   this segment reported a 1 percent decline in revenue in fiscal 2020. The firm has several drugs in
                                   Phase III of the pipeline to hopefully help asthma patients.

                                   Other Medicines
                                   The drugs AstraZeneca includes in this segment cover the areas of infection, neuroscience, and
                                   gastroenterology. COVID-19 drugs are included here—AstraZeneca had one of the more popular
                                   coronavirus drugs in the world along with rivals Moderna and Pfizer. This segment accounts for
                                   $2.5 billion in annual sales for AstraZeneca, and the products treat such aliments as influenza,
                                   schizophrenia, bipolar disease, osteoarthritic pain, and opioid-induced constipation. The drug
                                   Nexium, a proton pump inhibitor to treat acid-related diseases, represented nearly 50 percent of
                                   all sales in this segment. The firm divested rights in Europe to Grunenthal in October 2018 but
                                   still enjoys strong sales in other regions of the world. In the 2020 Annual Report, AstraZeneca
                                   derived only $2 million from COVID-19 vaccines, but this data only covered a limited period of
                                   the drug’s availability to the public.

               Regions Served
               Exhibit 4 shows that emerging markets accounted for the same revenue generation as the United
               States in 2020. Europe, with more than double the U.S. population, accounts for significantly less
               revenue, due in part to firms not being able to charge higher prices in this region. Infrastructure
               problems, governmental incentives, differences in drug approvals, and the preponderance of per-
               sons across countries capable of paying for various drugs explain the variation in AstraZeneca’s
               sales across regions.

               Competitors
               The highly competitive pharmaceutical industry is led by Johnson & Johnson, with a market cap
               at the time of writing of $430 billion, followed by Roche, Pfizer, Merck, and Novartis, with mar-
               ket caps of $288 billion, $214 billion, $195 billion, and $195 billion, respectively. AstraZeneca
               checks in at ninth with a market cap of $132 billion. Most of the top pharmaceutical firms are
               based in the United States, but Roche and Novartis are based in Switzerland. Interestingly,
               Moderna, another notable drug company with a popular COVID-19 vaccine, is not in the top 10
               largest firms based on market cap. There are several key players in the generic market, includ-
               ing Viatris, Teva Pharmaceuticals, and Sun Pharmaceutical, with India being the largest nation
               providing generic drugs globally.

               Bristol Myers Squibb
               Although only the seventh largest firm in the global pharmaceuticals industry, Bristol Myers
               Squibb (BMS) controls the second and third most popular oncology drugs in the industry. Recall
               that oncology is the top revenue-generating segment for AstraZeneca and the top overall revenue-­
               generating segment in the industry. The firm specializes in oncology and cardiovascular diseases,
               HIV, and other diseases. BMS traces its roots to 1887, and in 1989 it was the second largest
               pharmaceutical company in the world, but it lost market share after divesting holdings and mak-
               ing poor strategic decisions. BMS has had an aggressive acquisition history recently, with large
               acquisitions in 2015, 2017, and 2019, and it recently announced plans to acquire Celgene for $74
               billion. Celgene is a leading biopharmaceutical manufacturer in oncology, so this could place
               significant pressure on AstraZeneca.

               Johnson & Johnson
               The largest company by market capitalization in the pharmaceutical industry, Johnson & Johnson
               (J&J) is a household name around the world partly because the firm is so diversified, and many of
               the products are over-the-counter items such as baby powder, skin lotions, and skin oils. With respect

                                   to pharmaceuticals, J&J’s focus includes immunology, infectious diseases, vaccines, nervous system
                                   disorders, and oncology. J&J also has one of the more popular COVID-19 vaccines; however, batches
                                   of the vaccine had to be recalled.

                                   Pfizer
                                   Pfizer is likely the big winner in the COVID-19 vaccine lottery as it is arguably the most popu-
                                   lar one worldwide. Other key drugs of the firm include Lipitor, Norvasc, and Zoloft. Most of
                                   Pfizer’s manufacturing facilities are located in the United States as the country is the largest mar-
                                   ket, but the firm is expanding internationally as patent protection laws are increasingly enforced.
                                   Pfizer’s main businesses include biologics, small molecule medicines, and vaccines. Due to this
                                   profile, Pfizer and AstraZeneca do not compete as directly as some other firms do in the very
                                   competitive cancer research arena.

                                   External Issues
                                   Regions
                                   The United States is the world’s largest pharmaceutical market by a wide margin, partly because
                                   pharmaceutical firms can charge higher prices. Healthcare customers in the United States tend to
                                   be more fragmented and private, and there is less regulation on pricing as there is no centralized
                                   national health system like many other countries. As a result, U.S. consumers tend to pay the bill
                                   for citizens from other nations. For instance, in 2020, the U.S. government accelerated develop-
                                   ment of treatments and vaccines for COVID-19, likely saving millions of lives, and perhaps pav-
                                   ing the way for quicker to-the-market products from pharmaceutical firms. However, there are
                                   signs the U.S. windfall for big pharma may be waning as both Democrats and Republicans are
                                   lobbying for affordable drug prices.
                                        In 2021, the U.S. pharmaceutical market was estimated at over $500 billion. The top 6 pharma-
                                   ceutical spending nations in Europe account for $174 billion, with Germany and France being the
                                   largest spenders at $52 and $35 billion, respectively. China spent $95 billion and Japan spent $81
                                   billion on pharmaceuticals in 2020. China’s spending is expected to grow to $165 billion by 2023.

                                   Trends
                                   The global demand for healthcare is accelerating, with an aging population in established mar-
                                   kets and a growing income level in developing nations. By 2050, the number of people over the
                                   age of 60 will be 2 billion, and 80 percent of these citizens will be living in developing regions.
                                   Research suggests that as the percentage of older people is growing quicker than the younger
                                   percentage of the population, the reports of non-communicable diseases (NCDs) will increase.
                                   Disabilities caused by NCDs will become a large burden for global disease control and treatment
                                   but presents a large opportunity for pharmaceutical firms. NCDs kill over 41 million people
                                   annually and are responsible for 34 percent of the disease burden in 2019, compared to only
                                   21 percent in 1990. Smoking, poor diet, and lack of exercise have been blamed for many NCD
                                   deaths and health problems.
                                        Historically, R&D investments have focused on treatment options. This has been extremely
                                   profitable for the industry, but with increasing competition, there is a shift industrywide now to
                                   R&D that focuses more on prevention and even early intervention and detection. AstraZeneca’s
                                   research in developing many new diagnostic tests serve as examples here. It was a long-held
                                   belief that focusing on treatment was far more profitable than prevention and early detection, but
                                   some analysts now contend that pharmaceutical firms should focus more on developing cures
                                   rather than treatments.
                                        In 2020, the United States had $514 billion in global pharmaceutical sales, or 48 percent
                                   of the world’s total. Europe totaled $211 billion in sales, and emerging markets totaled $228
                                   billion. The entire world saw around $1.07 trillion in pharmaceutical sales in 2020. Note that
                                   AstraZeneca received 34 percent of its 2020 sales from emerging markets compared to the indus-
                                   try average of 21 percent.

                                   Regulatory Environment
                                   Regulations offer a major threat for many players in the industry as the public expects safe and
                                   effective drugs. As a result, governments around the world highly regulate their production and
                                   distribution. This prolonged approval process increases the cost of drugs and the time it takes for

               the drugs to reach desperate patients. Patents are used to protect firms, but piracy is increasing
               globally, and there is often a worry that drugs, once approved, may be stripped of patent protec-
               tion if they benefit society. One notable example is the question of COVID-19 vaccine patent
               protection rights. Fortunately, for the coronavirus and other diseases, government regulators have
               started the process of accelerating patient access to drugs that have transformative prospects.
                   With the exit of the United Kingdom from the European Union and the relocation of the
               European Medicines Agency from London to Amsterdam, there may be increased disruption of
               the regulatory process, and this could impact AstraZeneca directly. China continues to change re-
               quirements on its drug development, and the EU Health Strategy in November 2020 sought to re-
               define regulation of the pharmaceutical industry in the European Union. It is the hope of firms like
               AstraZeneca that the new EU policy will expediate and reduce the cost of bringing drugs to market.

               Pricing of Medicines
               There is significant downward pressure on what is a fair price for pharmaceutical products—
               good for consumers but bad for pharmaceutical companies. Highly regulated governments, in-
               surance companies, and other players are keeping costs down in many regions of the world. Drug
               prices in China dropped 50 percent for 119 medicines in March 2021, and in Europe, govern-
               ments extend stringent price control measures on medicines. President Joe Biden has supported
               proposals that significantly reduce the price of drugs in the United States, which was tradition-
               ally viewed as a market where drug makers could generate the bulk of their sales—this market
               accounted for 48 percent of global pharmaceutical sales in 2020.

               Generic Drugs
               Even when prices remain high and patents are honored, both are finite, and protection does ex-
               pire. Generic drugs benefit from not having large R&D and market development expenses and
               are available at substantially lower prices. For example, in 2020, in the United States alone, over
               85 percent of prescriptions dispensed were for generic drugs. The generic drug market presents
               a significant threat for firms that have enormous R&D expenses like AstraZeneca. In addition,
               governments are offering incentives (or legal bribes, if you care to think of incentives this way)
               to pharmacists to fill prescriptions with generics.

               Brexit
               A year after the United Kingdom exited the European Union (“Brexit”), the UK government and
               the European Union were able to come to terms on a trade agreement, but many issues remain.
               Free trade and free movement of workers will play an important role; at present, 11 percent of
               the workforce of AstraZeneca is based in the United Kingdom and 12 percent in Europe.

               Oncology Remains on Top
               As discussed earlier in the case, AstraZeneca’s leading segment is oncology, and oncology is,
               in fact, the largest segment across the industry in terms of revenue as well in spending on drug
               research (it is thus a major driver of spending growth). New technology in this area includes
               drugs working with the body’s immune system to fight off cancer as opposed to older technology
               where the drugs directly targeted the cancer cells themselves. Three of the leading drugs with
               this approach are owned by Merck and BMS. While BMS is eighth in terms of market cap, this
               firm has the second and third most popular drugs in the field of oncology, making BMS a serious
               competitor for AstraZeneca. For reference, AstraZeneca’s Tagrisso is the seventh most popular
               oncology drug.

               Conclusion
               Strategy Considerations
               AstraZeneca is a global player in the pharmaceutical industry and needs a clear strategic plan
               moving forward. Note that the firm has four distinct divisions with one, the cancer research
               division, leading sales by a wide margin. What should AstraZeneca do with the other divi-
               sions? How should the firm shift its resources around? Your job as a student is to assume you
               have been hired by AstraZeneca to produce a three-year strategic plan, so be careful not to

                                   news releases, unless this matches your own detailed strategic analysis. Instead, report what your
                                   analysis suggests the company should do based on your strategic management knowledge and
                                   research. In fact, this is exactly what AstraZeneca would pay you to do if you were really hired
                                   to develop a three-year strategic plan. Other considerations to take into account are the organi-
                                   zational structure. Would you suggest a change? Does the mission or vision of the firm need to
                                   be reworked? Do you agree with the latest mergers and management’s desire to push revenues
                                   past $40 billion annually? Is growth in this direction the most effective and efficient option, or is
                                   there a better alternative to grow? What drug lines would you consider selling to rival firms? Be
                                   mindful that shareholders expect at least a 5-percent top-line and bottom-line growth annually.
                                       The pharmaceutical industry has a bright future, with an aging population in the United
                                   States, Europe, and Japan and emerging markets that have more disposable income. What prod-

               www.shell.com
               Headquartered in Haagse Hout, The Hague, Netherlands, Shell is the largest company in Europe.
               A British–Dutch oil and gas company that is highly vertically integrated with extensive opera-
               tions in over 100 countries, Shell employs experts in the exploration, production, refining and
               marketing of oil and natural gas as well as the manufacturing and marketing of chemicals glob-
               ally. The company uses advanced technologies to extract and process oil and gas and is also
               involved in wind, solar, advanced biofuels, and hydrogen.
                   At the end of 2020, Shell had 87,000 employees working in over 70 countries, operated 13
               refineries, and produced about 3.5 million barrels of oil and 70 million tons of liquefied natural gas
               (LNG) per day. Shell globally explores for crude oil and natural gas and extracts these products from
               major fields; it also extracts bitumen from oil sands, cools natural gas to produce LNC, and builds
               and operates refineries and chemical plants that produce lubricants, petrochemicals, diesel, and avia-
               tion fuel. Additionally, Shell invests in wind and solar to reduce global carbon dioxide emissions.

               History
               The Shell Transport and Trading Company was founded by Marcus Samuel in 1890, and the
               Royal Dutch Petroleum Company was founded by Jean Kessler, Henri Deterding, and Hugo
               Loudon in 1897. The two rival companies merged in April 1907, primarily for the purpose of
               competing more effectively with the U.S.-based Standard Oil. In 1912, the merged company,
               Royal Dutch Shell, purchased the Rothschilds’ Russian oil assets.
                    Shell was battered by the COVID-19 pandemic, with the company in February 2021 report-
               ing a loss of $21.7 billion for the year 2020 despite a reduction in operating expenses by $4.5
               billion (12 percent). To give you a feel for what Shell does globally today, some of its projects
               that are currently operating or under construction are described below.
                    Appomattox is Shell’s largest floating deep-water oil and gas operation/platform in the Gulf
               of Mexico.
                    LNG Canada is a huge natural gas project under construction off the west coast of British
               Columbia, Canada, but 10 years away from completion. Shell owns 40 percent of this project,
               followed by PETRONAS (25 percent), PetroChina (15 percent), Mitsubishi Corporation (15 per-
               cent), and KOGAS (5 percent). This location offers a relatively short shipping distance to north-
               ern Asia, one of the fastest-growing gas markets in the world, avoiding the Panama Canal.
                    Pennsylvania Petrochemicals Complex is a 100-percent Shell-owned petrochemicals plant
               under construction 30 miles northwest of Pittsburgh to process ethane from shale gas. About 70
               percent of North American polyethylene customers are within a 700-mile radius of Pittsburgh,
               thus offering Shell a competitive advantage over rivals.
                    Vito is Shell’s 11th deep-water project in the Gulf of Mexico, scheduled to begin producing
               about 100,000 barrels of oil per day in 2021. Shell owns 63 percent of the operation and Statoil
               USA E&P Inc. owns 37 percent.
                    Bonga North West is a Shell operation producing 40,000 barrels of oil per day in the Gulf of
               Guinea off the coast of Nigeria in an average water depth of 3,300 feet.
                    Cardamom is a 100-percent Shell-owned oil and gas operation located in the Gulf of Mexico
               currently producing about 50,000 barrels of oil per day in 2,600-feet-deep water.
                    Gumusut-Kakap is Shell’s first deep-water project in Malaysia, producing about 148,000
               barrels of oil per day from the Gumusut-Kakap field in 3,900-feet-deep water.
                    Kaikias is an 80-percent Shell-owned deep-water oil and gas project in the Gulf of Mexico.
               MOEX North America LLC owns 20 percent of the project.
                    Malampaya Phases 2 & 3 is a 45 percent Shell-owned natural gas-to-power project located
               off the northwest coast of the Philippines that provides 20 percent of that country’s electric-
               ity. Chevron owns 45 percent of the operation, and the Philippine National Oil Corporation-
               Exploration Corporation (government) owns 10 percent.

                                       Malikai is a 35-percent Shell-owned floating oil production facility located off Sabah,
                                   Malaysia, that produces about 60,000 barrels of oil per day. ConocoPhilips owns 35 percent and
                                   Petronas Carigali owns 30 percent of this floating platform, which produces and pipes oil about
                                   30 miles to the shallow-water Kebabangan platform for processing.
                                       Nanhai Petrochemicals Complex is located in Guangdong Province, China, and is 50 percent
                                   owned by both Shell and the China National Offshore Oil Company (CNOOC) Petrochemicals
                                   Investment Company Limited. This operation supplies the Chinese market with about 3 million
                                   tons of ethylene and propylene derivative products, used in a wide range of industrial and con-

                                       Ormen Lange is a 17.8-percent Shell-owned deep-water oil and gas operation located in the
                                   Norwegian Sea 75 miles northwest of Kristiansund, Norway. It meets 20 percent of the United
                                   Kingdom’s gas needs via one of the world’s longest subsea pipelines. Petoro owns 36.5 percent
                                   of this operation, followed by Statoil at 25.4 percent. The facility produces about 100,000 gallons

                                       Parque Das Conchas is a 50-percent Shell-owned ultra-deep oil and gas operation located
                                   at Campos Basin, Brazil, that currently produces natural gas. The other owners are ONGC, at 27
                                   percent, and Qatar Petroleum International, at 23 percent.

                                   Vision/Mission
                                   On their corporate website, Shell states their “purpose” as offering more and cleaner energy
                                   solutions that raise standards of living globally in order to drive demand for energy, including
                                   oil and gas, for years to come. It also notes the need to tackle climate change and transition to a
                                   low-carbon energy consumption planet. Also mentioned is a focus on safety and having a “Goal
                                   Zero” philosophy, meaning zero harm to its people or the environment.

                                   Organizational Structure
                                   Shell appears to have an organizational structure based on strategic business units (SBUs).
                                   There are four: 1) Downstream, 2) Upstream, 3) Projects & Technology, and 4) Integrated Gas/
                                   Renewables/Energy. There appears to be no chief operating officer (COO). The Chair of Shell’s
                                   board of directors is Sir Andrew Mackenzie, but the company’s CEO, Ben van Beurden, serves
                                   as a board member, as does the company’s CFO, Jessica Uhl. There are more women than men
                                   on Shell’s board of directors.
                                       Exhibit 1 provides a list of the top Shell executives that comprise the company’s executive
                                   committee, as well as the company’s likely chain of command.

               Exhibits 2 and 3 below show the financial statements for Shell. Note that the firm had a disas-
               trous year in 2020 as COVID-19 stopped or curtailed travel for both leisure and work. Note that
               on the balance sheets cash increased significantly as plant property and equipment were sold off
               as mentioned later under the segment data. Accounts receivable dropped 23 percent, lowering
               total assets by 6 percent on the year.

                                   Strategy
                                   Being reliant on oil and gas is starting to become a threat for a firm, for electric vehicles are
                                   becoming increasingly popular, overall fuel efficiency is increasing, and new measures are being
                                   created by governments to reduce emissions. Shell is attempting to shift its resources to becom-
                                   ing a net-zero-emissions firm with a deadline of 2050. In 2021, Shell introduced its Powering
                                   Progress initiative to accelerate the transition to a net-zero-emissions business. Shell plans to
                                   achieve this target by reducing emissions generated from the products it sells to customers, cap-
                                   turing residual emissions, or countering them with offsets.
                                       Shell is in the process of shifting its business more toward biofuels, hydrogen-charging for
                                   electric automobiles, and solar and wind technology. However, this is a slow process for Shell as
                                   the firm has a stated goal of increasing biofuels and hydrogen in transportation from 3 percent
                                   to 10 percent by 2030. By then, Shell also aims to provide renewable electricity to 50 million
                                   households and offer 2.5 million electric charging ports for automobiles
                                       Shells’ other aspirations or targets include $100 million spent on nature areas such as forest
                                   and wetlands as well as plans to invest up to $3 billion annually in the renewables and energy
                                   solutions businesses. Shell has tied a portion of pay to 16,500 staff (Shell has not disclosed what
                                   portion this amounts to) to reducing the firm’s carbon footprint by 6 to 8 percent between 2016
                                   and 2023.

                                   By-Segment Information
                                   Shell is organized into four basic segments: 1) Integrated Gas, 2) Renewables & Energy
                                   Solutions, 3) Upstream, 4) Downstream, and 5) Projects & Technology. However, the firm re-

                                   Corporate. Integrated Gas, Upstream, Oil Products, and Chemicals are all within the Projects and
                                   Technology segment. Corporate does not sell anything; it is only reported separate for bookkeep-
                                   ing purposes.

                                   Integrated Gas, Renewables, & Energy Solutions
                                   This segment manages the firm’s extensive liquefied natural gas (LNG) operations, including
                                   exploration, extraction, conversion of natural gas into fuels, and all upstream and downstream
                                   activities associated with LNG. This segment includes the old New Energies business and the
                                   new Renewables and Energy Solutions business. In 2020, this segment was able to develop the
                                   first phase of Arrow Energy’s Surat Gas Project, which is located in Australia. Total gas output is
                                   expected at 90 billion cubic feet per year by 2030. In the same year, a new LGN processing unit
                                   in Nigeria was established by Shell and the Blauwwind consortium, and it now generates power.
                                        Integrated Gas, Renewables, & Energy Solutions is the second-largest revenue generating
                                   segment and, at over 20 percent, has the best profit margin of all divisions. Most of the revenue
                                   derived from this segment is from LNG, not the renewables section, but Shell actually com-
                                   bines renewables with LNG for reporting purposes. Shell is building Renewables and Energy
                                   Solutions through both organic (internal) growth and acquisitions (external).
                                        By 2020, Shell was investing about $900 million annually in renewables and had a few nota-

               Shell has contributed to 60,000 solar panel home installations globally and is partly responsible
               for 60,000 thousand electric vehicle (EV) charging ports at private homes across the Netherlands,
               Germany, France, and the United Kingdom, with another 8,000 for businesses and private drives
               in the United States, Canada, and Singapore. Finally, Shell has many onshore and offshore wind
               farms across the world, but most of the wind farms are located in the United States.

               Upstream
               This segment manages raw material exploration for and extraction of crude oil, natural gas, and
               natural gas liquid. Getting oil (and other products) from oil rigs, deep-water drilling, oil sands,
               and other means is considered Upstream. This segment generates the least revenue for Shell but
               was quite profitable until 2020, when this segment lost more than all other segments combined.
                    Shell has over 40 years’ experience extracting oil from deep beneath the ocean, with projects in
               the United States, Brazil, Nigeria, and Malaysia. At Shell’s Stones Project in the Gulf of Mexico,
               oil is drilled in water 3,000 meters deep and another 6,000 meters through bedrock for a production
               of 50,000 barrels of oil a day. In terms of total distance from the surface, Shell owns and operates
               the world’s deepest oil drilling operation utilizing a floating production, storage, and offloading
               (FPSO) vessel. Today, Shell has 12 such FPSOs in use worldwide. In Malaysia, Shell’s Gumusut-
               Kakap platform operates in 1,200-meter-deep water, with peak production in the area of 148,000
               barrels per day, but this region is notorious for tropical storms, making safety an issue at times.
                    Regarding Shell’s value chain, the upstream products are backward integrated. There are
               many businesses and profit points along the value chain that strive to secure a slice of the profit
               pie. The actual price of oil fluctuates quite a lot; it can double or halve in a matter of months,
               whereas the price at the gas station will not move as quickly. Competing in this industry can be
               volatile, showcased by the great profit margins in 2019 followed by absolute disaster in 2020.
               Shell has sold a 60-percent interest in the Vaca Muerta Basin in Argentina and divested many
               businesses in Brazil, Canada, Nigeria, the United States, and Egypt. Shell is in fact rethinking
               competing in the upstream market—but one should be careful when analyzing the 2021 profits
               and revenues from this segment based on extensive divestiture activity in 2020.

               Oil Products
               This segment generates more revenue than all other segments combined but experienced a huge
               drop in 2020 revenues compared to the other segments. The COVID-19 pandemic impacted
               much of these results, but the broader lesson is that products sold in this segment are much more
               prone to fluctuations from any number of events. Note that while earnings can be quite good,
               profit margins are less impressive than in other businesses, meaning there is much less room for
               mismanagement from the corporate office and less wiggle room from external events.
                    This business is part of Shell’s integrated value chain, where the company refines products
               and moves them to customers as needed. Products sold in this segment include gasoline, die-
               sel, heating oil, aviation fuel, marine fuel, lubricants, bitumen, and sulfur. This segment can be
               thought of as “middle stream,” with upstream being finding the products and drilling for them.
               This segment refines the products; downstream sells the products to the end customer. Shell has
               13 refineries worldwide that can process 2.2 million barrels of crude oil daily, with refining capa-
               bilities in Europe & Africa, the Americas, and Asia totaling 46, 33, and 21 percent, respectively.
               The fact is, despite all the talk about clean energy, Shell is still overwhelmingly dependent on
               traditional aspects of finding, drilling, and refining oil.

               Chemicals
               Shell’s chemical business did well in 2020—it was the only segment to turn a profit. Note, how-
               ever, that the segment only generates marginal revenue and limited profits. The industries served
               by the chemical business includes automobiles, packaging, and other machinery industries. The
               chemicals produced include ethylene, propylene, solvents, detergent alcohols, and ethylene gly-
               col. Shell operates chemical plants worldwide and supplied 1,000 industrial customers with over
               15 million tons of petrochemicals in 2020. At the time of writing, Shell had plans to integrate
               a portion of its chemical business with its refining business, so be careful comparing numbers
               between 2020 and future years within chemicals.

                                   Deep-Water Drilling
                                   Many oil companies feel that, despite cleaner energy alternatives becoming more common,
                                   popular, and in demand by the public, as the world’s population increases, so does the need
                                   for oil. Under the oceans, in water ranging from hundreds to thousands of meters, are vast
                                   amounts of oil and gas, most of which have never been found. Some estimates suggest there
                                   are 270 billion barrels of oil in deep water left to be found. In 1978 the deepest offshore drill-
                                   ing location was in less than 400 meters, but today the deepest drilling can be done in water
                                   over 3,000 meters deep.

                   There are many risks associated with drilling, such as oil spills, which have profound en-
               vironmental effects and are dangerous work for employees. In 2010, the Deepwater Horizon
               rig, situated in water 1,500 meters deep but drilling through an additional 11,000 meters of
               ocean floor to reach the oil, became the largest oil spill in American history. In this accident,
               11 people were killed and 720 million liters of oil were spilled into the Gulf of Mexico over
               3 months.
                   As of 2021, the technology exists to drill 20,000 meters past the ocean floor. Equipment
               must be able to tolerate 180°C in some locations, where the earth’s mantle is close to the oil.
               Deep-water drilling is becoming increasingly popular. Many firms, including Shell, drill in the
               Gulf of Mexico. During the first decade of this century, only 15 percent of the U.S. oil produc-
               tion in the Gulf of Mexico was derived from ultra-deep drilling; by 2017, this number had
               increased to 52 percent, thanks in part to technology allowing deeper drilling. In 2020, a new
               record for the Gulf of Mexico was set with 2 million barrels of oil produced in a single day. It
               has been accepted in the industry that massive amounts of free cash can be generated from a
               bountiful deep-water well.
                   However, the new technology has not advanced as fast as the dangers and margins of error
               of engaging in such risky activities; in fact, research reveals that in deep-water drilling, for every
               additional 30 meters drilled, serious accidents grow by a staggering 8 percent.
                   Other hot spots for deep-water drilling are off the coasts of Malaysia, Brazil, and Nigeria.
               Keep in mind that there is a lot of ocean drilling done in places like the North Sea that may not
               be considered “deep water” as the term is generally used for drilling in water in excess of 300
               meters, and ultra-deep water is drilling in water in excess of 1,500 meters.

               Macroeconomic Risks
               There is a significant and growing trend toward electric cars, and a lot of social stigma is at-
               tached to high-polluting vehicles in much of the world. The supply and demand factors of oil
               procurement and distribution are also a major risk in this industry, and wild swings in oil and
               gas prices are fairly common. In 2020 alone, oil prices ranged from $13 per barrel to $50 per
               barrel, down over 30 percent average from 2019. By the middle of 2021, oil prices ranged from
               $45 to $75 a barrel. Oil and gas firms cannot set their own prices either, as organizations such
               as Brent, West Texas Intermediate, Henry Hub, UK National Balancing Point, Japan Customs,
               and OPEC all influence the price of oil. Political instability in much of the world where gas
               is located presents risks, and poor weather conditions on offshore drilling can significantly
               impact revenues.

               Petroleum Refining
               The global market for petroleum refining is huge, with top players including Marathon Petroleum,
               Valero Energy, ExxonMobil, Chevron, BP, Phillips, and Shell. One advantage to competing in
               this industry is that the barriers to entry are quite high for several reasons, which include ex-
               tremely high competition, high volatility, lower profit margins, and the high capital investments
               needed. Nevertheless, revenue growth is to remain high up to 2026, so before oil firms shut tra-
               ditional operations down, there is still a significant amount of money to be made in this business.
               Increased regulations, however, will likely reduce margins.
                   A common trend in the oil and gas industry is to upgrade existing facilities rather than build
               new ones. A threat for refiners in the United States is West Texas Intermediate prices, which are
               expected to increase to match Brent’s in the coming years, adding further downward pressure on
               profits for refineries. Exhibit 6 reveals that about half of all oil refined is produced as gasoline
               and 22 percent is converted to diesel fuel, indicating the vast majority of the market is based on
               the transportation business, and the transportation industry is committed long-term to combus-
               tible engines.

               Many People Live without Electricity
               About 1 billion people worldwide currently live without electricity, creating an enormous hu-
               manitarian situation and an opportunity for energy providers. The current global population of
               over 7 billion people is expected to grow to 9 billion in the next two decades. The middle class
               will expand by more than 5 billion by 2030, with Asia accounting for 90 percent of the world’s
               new entrants into this demographic.

                                   Competitors
                                   There are not as many rival firms in the oil and gas industry as in many other industries, but the
                                   firms that are competing tend to be extremely large. Shell, Exxon, BP, Chevron, ConocoPhillips,
                                   Eni, Total, and other behemoths dominate the business. Many of these firms compete up and
                                   down the value chain, from exploration and drilling (upstream) all the way to owning their own
                                   gas stations and selling to the public (downstream). Deciding where and how to compete along
                                   this value chain is of extreme importance. Deciding where to drill is also paramount. With so
                                   many firms competing on the same dimensions and selling the same commodity, management
                                   and research become key components to success as margins are low and it is difficult to dis-
                                   tinguish a liter of gas produced by Shell from one by Exxon; customers often simply want the
                                   cheapest they can get.
                                       In addition to large traditional energy players, many smaller firms who specialize in wind
                                   power, solar power, and electric battery production are competing in the green space. A few
                                   notable solar firms include Solar Edge Technologies and SolarPower Corp. Plug Power,
                                   QuantumScape, and even Tesla are producing battery technology for cars. There are too many of
                                   these firms to list and most are small, but many firms could certainly develop into serious rivals.

                                   Exxon
                                   Headquartered in Texas, in the United States, Exxon is a large oil and gas corporation that re-
                                   ported revenues of $279 billion, $255 billion, and $178 billion in 2018, 2019, and 2020, respec-
                                   tively; the firm also made $21 billion and $14 billion in 2018 and 2019, respectively, and lost
                                   $22 billion in 2020. Exxon operates in the same businesses as Shell: upstream, downstream, and
                                   chemical.
                                        Exxon’s upstream business produces 4 million oil-equivalent barrels of oil and natural gas
                                   daily and operates in 40 countries. The upstream business has stakes in deep-water drilling, un-
                                   conventional, LNG, heavy oil, and conventional. The firm’s Mobil 1 leads the world in synthetic
                                   motor oil sales and is the single best-selling U.S. retail motor oil.
                                        ExxonMobil is one of the largest petrochemical companies in the world, providing materials
                                   for use in products such as plastic bottles, synthetic rubber, solvents, and countless other goods;
                                   it sells 5 million barrels a day of petroleum products in total. The company is the largest global
                                   manufacturer of paraxylene and benzene. Exxon is also a large producer of ethylene and propyl-
                                   ene; like many of the chemicals Exxon produces, these are considered feedstock, meaning they
                                   are the basic ingredients used to help produce many products we use today in different fuels,
                                   fibers, packaging film, automotive parts, etc.
                                        Exxon is the world leader in capturing CO2. It has captured more than 120 million tons to
                                   date, which amounts to 40 percent of all the anthropogenic CO2 ever captured in the world.
                                   Exxon states that it is committed to transforming itself as green energy becomes increasingly
                                   sought after, affordable, reliable, and powerful.

               Headquartered in Italy, Eni SpA is a large oil and gas company that operates in many busi-
               nesses including 1) Refining & Marketing, which focuses on refining and marketing of petro-
               leum products; 2) Trading, which covers group services in commodity trading, shipping, and
               derivatives; 3) Petrochemicals, which includes the production and sale of petrochemical prod-

               Exploration & Production, which focuses on exploration for, development of, and production of
               oil and natural gas; 6) Gas & Power, which covers the supply, regasification, transport, storage,
               distribution and marketing of natural gas, power generation, and electricity sales; and 7) Power
               and Renewables. Eni sells oil and gas in over 80 countries and operates numerous subsidiaries.
               The firm reported revenues of €44 billion in 2020, down from €70 billion in 2019.

               Conclusion
               Traditional oil and gas is slowly being phased out and replaced with wind, solar, and battery
               power. The automobile industry is on the forefront of this change, and many homes are powered
               by solar panels as well. The days of drilling for oil and using oil to power everything are eventu-
               ally going to go the way of coal-powered steamboats of the 1800s. People still want the power—
               just not from antiquated technology. In the meantime though, oil still generates billions of dollars
               in revenues and profits and can serve to help firms in the industry shift their capacity to cleaner
               energy alternatives. There are gigantic fixed assets in this industry that firms like Shell must cope
               with while trying to produce a profit even as industrywide profit margins decline.
                   When developing a strategic plan for Shell, be sure to consider where along the value chain
               Shell should do business—upstream, in the middle, or downstream? How much capital should
               Shell devote to renewable energy and renewable energy technologies? What is the most effec-
               tive way to acquire these capabilities? Should Shell spend more on R&D—that is, grow or-
               ganically—or should Shell purchase firms like the ones mentioned previously that are already in
               these industries—that is, should Shell grow externally?
                   CEO Beurden has a lot to consider as he moves resources around and charts the future for
               Shell. When developing the 3-year strategic plan, be mindful not to simply report exactly what
               Shell is currently doing or what you think they are going to do from reading the news releases
               (unless you agree with this path based on your analysis). Rather, focus on what direction you
               would recommend Shell pursue, as if the company had hired your team as consultants to chart
               the future path over the next 3 years. Your task is to design a strategic plan for Shell that will win
               tomorrow, but remember that winning today is a prerequisite for that.

                                   Headquartered in Burbank, California, The Walt Disney Company (Disney) is a diversified
                                   entertainment company operating worldwide in four segments that include: Media Networks,
                                   Parks and Resorts, Studio Entertainment, and Consumer Products & Interactive Media (CP&IP).
                                   The word Disney for many people means Mickey Mouse-related products, but the entire
                                   umbrella of Disney also includes ESPN, ABC, Marvel, Pixar, cruise boats, and many other
                                   products and services. Disney reported revenues and net income in 2017 of $55 billion and $9
                                   billion, but both numbers were down slightly from 2016.
                                        For Disney’s Q2 2018 that ended 3-31-18, the company reported a 9 percent increase in reve-
                                   nues, compared to the prior year period, to $14.5 billion, and a 23 percent increase in net income
                                   to $2.9 billion. These excellent results were led by the company’s strong performance from its
                                   (1) Parks and Resorts and (2) Studio Entertainment segments. Within the Studio Entertainment
                                   segment, excellent movies such as Black Panther and Avengers: Infinity War helped lead the
                                   way. Within the Parks and Resorts segment, the company reported nice growth at Disneyland
                                   Paris and Hong Kong Disneyland Resort, and Walt Disney World Resort—but decreases in at-
                                   tendance and revenues at Shanghai Disney Resort.

                                   History
                                   Mr. Walt Disney and his brother Roy arrived in California in the summer of 1923 to sell his
                                   cartoon called Alice’s Wonderland. A distributor named M. J. Winkler contracted to distribute
                                   the Alice Comedies on October 16, 1923, and the Disney Brothers Cartoon Studio was founded.
                                   Over the years, the company produced many cartoons, from Oswald the Lucky Rabbit (1927) to
                                   Silly Symphonies (1932), Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937), and Pinocchio and Fantasia
                                   (1940). The company name was changed to Walt Disney Studio in 1925. Mickey Mouse emerged
                                   in 1928 with the first cartoon in sound. In 1950, Disney completed its first live-action film,
                                   Treasure Island, and in 1954, the company began television with the Disneyland anthology se-
                                   ries. In 1955, Disney’s most successful series, The Mickey Mouse Club, began. Also in 1955, the
                                   new Disneyland Park in Anaheim, California, opened.
                                       Disney created a series of releases from the 1950s through the 1970s, including The Shaggy
                                   Dog, Zorro, Mary Poppins, and The Love Bug. Mr. Walt Disney died in 1966. In 1969, the
                                   Disney started its educational films and materials. Another important time of Disney’s history
                                   was opening Walt Disney World in Orlando, Florida, in 1971. In 1982, the Epcot Center opened
                                   as part of Walt Disney World. The following year, Tokyo Disneyland opened.
                                       After leaving network television in 1983, Disney introduced its cable network, The Disney
                                   Channel. In 1985, Disney’s Touchstone division began the successful Golden Girls and Disney
                                   Sunday Movie. In 1988, Disney opened the Grand Floridian Beach and Caribbean Beach
                                   Resorts at Walt Disney World along with three new gated attractions: the Disney/MGM Studios
                                   Theme Park, Pleasure Island, and Typhoon Lagoon. Filmmaking soon hit new heights as Disney
                                   for the first time led Hollywood studios in box-office gross.
                                       From 2000 to 2007, Disney created new attractions in its theme parks, produced many
                                   successful films, opened new hotels and built Hong Kong Disneyland. Disney acquired Pixar
                                   in 2006. Shanghai Disney Resort opened in 2015, the same year Disney released Star Wars

               Vision/Mission
               Disney’s vision (paraphrased) is “to make people feel great.” The mission of Disney
               (­paraphrased) is “to be one of the leading producers and providers of creative, innovative, and
               ­profitable entertainment and information globally.

               Internal Issues
               Organizational Structure
               Disney seemingly operates from a strategic business unit (SBU) type structure with the units ­aligning
               with the four executives with the title Chairman. Perhaps division heads report to these Chairman
               persons, such as the head theme park person for each park reporting to Bob Chapek. Although actual
               reporting relationships are not made public, an extended SBU type organizational structure would
               likely work well for the firm, but it would require changes in the Exhibit 1 depiction.

                                   experienced a rise in revenues and net income. Note also that two segments comprise most of
                                   Disney’s revenues: 1) Media Networks and 2) Parks and Resorts.
                                       Specifically for Q2 2018, Disney reported that its revenues increased 3, 13, 21, and
                                   2 ­percent, respectively for its four segments: 1) Media Networks, 2) Parks and Resorts,
                                   3) Studio Entertainment, and 4) Consumer Products & Interactive Media. However for Q2, two
                                   of those four segments reported declines in operating income, Media Networks (-6 percent) and
                                   Consumer Products & Interactive Media (-4 percent). Regarding the Media Networks segment,
                                   for Q2 2018, the Cable Networks business grew revenues 5 percent to $4.2 billion but reported
                                   a decline in operating income of 4 percent to $1.7 billion. The other business within Media
                                   Networks is Broadcasting which for Q2 2018 reported steady revenues and operating income of
                                   $1.9 billion and $343 million, respectively.

                                   Media Networks
                                   Media Networks is the largest Disney SBU in both revenues and operating income, account-
                                   ing for $23 billion or 43 percent of all revenues in 2017. This percent has been fairly constant
                                   since 2012. Within Media Networks, Disney owns and operates the ABC Television Network
                                   that reaches nearly 100 percent of all U.S. households. This segment also includes ABC-owned

                                   Radio Disney network and many more. The ABC Television Network operates more than 244
                                   affiliated stations across the United States. Disney Channels Worldwide consists of 94 kids and
                                   family entertainment channels available in 162 countries and 34 languages. ABC Family is a
                                   mixture of series and movies. Disney ABC Domestic Television provides motion pictures and
                                   TV programming to U.S.-based media platforms. Disney Media Distribution is an international
                                   distributor of branded and non-branded content to all platforms. Hyperion publishes fiction and
                                   non-fiction titles for adults. Radio Disney is available in more than 40 U.S. markets, and on sat-

                                        Disney owns 80 percent of ESPN with the other 20 percent owned by Hearst Corporation.
                                   The ESPN network operates eight sports channels, with most operating 24 hours a day, reaching
                                   61 nations in English, Spanish, Portuguese, and French. ESPN owns 30 percent stake in CTV
                                   Specialty Television located in Canada; Disney owns a 20 percent stake in Seven TV in Russia.

               communication providers (affiliate fees) and 35 percent of revenues generated from advertising
               with the balance being derived from other sources. There are simply fewer television viewers
               today, and fewer viewers generally mean less bargaining power for Disney to negotiate prices
               with advertisers and cable providers.
                   Disney is forward integrated by owning eight TV stations in the United States, including the
               top 4 markets in New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, and Philadelphia and two more in the top
               eight. In a somewhat interesting deal, Hulu LLC, a live streaming service, is each owned 30 per-
               cent jointly by Disney and rivals 21st Century Fox, and Comcast Corporation with Time Warner
               owning the remaining 10 percent stake in Hulu.

               Parks and Resorts
               When most people think of Disney, Parks and Resorts probably is the first thing that comes to
               mind. Parks and Resorts derive revenue from park ticket prices, food, hotels, cruise vacations,
               and merchandise. In 2017, 80 percent of the division’s revenues were derived from domestic op-
               erations with 20 percent derived from international sales. U.S. Parks and Resorts revenues only
               increased 4 percent in 2017 while international revenues increased 32 percent. In fact, the growth
               internationally was so robust in 2016, the U.S. Parks and Resorts accounted for 84 ­percent of
               segment revenues. In total, U.S. revenues for this division increased less than $600 million while
               International revenues increased nearly $900 million in 2017.
                   The international growth of this segment is mostly explained through 27 percent higher
               volumes but also through 4 percent higher spending per customer on average. Disney has done
               an excellent job attracting additional “park” customers but has room to improve on getting them
               to spend more once in the park or on the cruise. Exhibits 2 and 3 reveal that Disney domestic
               revenues from its Parks and Resorts division increased overall 8.5 percent in 2017 to $18.4 bil-
               lion, up from $16.9 billion in 2016 and $12.9 billion in 2012. Operating income increased $550
               million or 14.4 percent from 2016 to 2017. This is the only Disney division to increase either
               revenues or operating income in 2017, and it successfully increased both.
                   Disney’s Parks and Resorts segment includes 11 divisions: 1) Disneyland Resorts in
               California, 2) Tokyo Disney Resort, 3) Disneyland Resort Paris, 4) Hong Kong Disneyland,
               5) Walt Disney World Resort in Florida, 6) Disney Cruise Line, 7) Adventures by Disney,
               8) Disney Vacation Club, 9) Walt Disney Imagineering, 10) Aluani, a Disney Resort and Spa
               in Hawaii, and 11) Disney Shanghai. Disney does not fully own its international parks. For ex-
               ample, Disney controls 77 percent of the Euro Disney in Paris, only earns royalties from Tokyo
               Disneyland, and owns 43 percent of Disney in Hong Kong.
                   Disney’s four cruise ships operate under this segment. The ships are named as follows:
               Disney Magic, Disney Wonder, Disney Dream, and Disney Fantasy. The latter two ships are
               Disney’s largest and are the same size, both 130,000-ton-vessels, offering 1,250 staterooms and
               14 decks.

               Studio Entertainment
               Within this segment, Disney produces live-action and animated motion pictures, direct-to-video
               programming, musical recordings, and live stage plays. Disney motion pictures are distributed
               under the names: Theatrical Market, Home Entertainment Market, Television Market, Disney
               Music Group, and Disney Theatrical Productions. Disney has licensed the rights to produce
               and distribute features films such as Spider-Man, The Fantastic Four, and X-Men to third-party
               studios. Disney also produces Star Wars. Disney earns a licensing fee on these films whereas
               the third-party studio incurs the cost to produce and distribute the films. Currently, Disney has
               a diverse business line in the Studio Entertainment SBU consisting of the following: Marvel,
               Touchstone, Pixar, Disneynature, Disney Studios Motion Pictures, and more Disney branded
               services. Disney’s Studio Entertainment revenues for 2017 decreased 11 percent to $8.4 billion
               and operating income decreased 13 percent. This SBU is divided into three areas: theatrical
               distribution, home entertainment, and TV/SVOD (Subscription Video on Demand) distribution.
               There was no change in TV/SVOD revenues in 2017 and it is the largest revenue generating divi-
               sion of this segment, representing 44 percent of the SBU’s revenues. The largest drop in SBU
               revenue within this segment came from theatrical distribution, dropping 21 percent with home
               entertainment dropping 15 percent in 2017.

    510    STRATEGIC-MANAGEMENT CASE ANALYSIS

                                   Consumer Products & Interactive Media
                                   Historically Disney separated these two SBUs but now combines them in their Annual Report.
                                   Disney’s Consumer Products segment partners with licenses, manufacturers, publishers, and retail-
                                   ers worldwide who design, promote, and sell a wide variety of products based on new and ­existing
                                   Disney characters. Product offerings are 1) character merchandise and publications licensing,
                                   2) books and magazines, and 3) the Disney store. Disney released in mid-2011 a new toy line that
                                   captured the fantasy, action, and adventure of Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides. Disney
                                   is perhaps the largest worldwide licensor of character-based merchandise and producer/distributor
                                   of children’s film-related products based on retail sales. Disney’s Interactive Media segment cre-
                                   ates and delivers games and media for smartphones and tablets. Revenues for the SBU dropped
                                   13 percent in 2017, but this SBU is the lowest generating SBU at Disney as revealed in Exhibit 3.
                                   The SBU’s operating income as revealed in Exhibit 3, dropped 11 percent in 2017.

                                   Finance
                                   Disney has been struggling financially mostly with its media-related divisions. Overall company
                                   revenues were down slightly in 2017 and net income down 4 percent as revealed in Exhibit 4.
                                   Exhibit 5 reveals that approximately one third of Disney’s assets are in the form of goodwill.
                                   Disney has accumulated tons of goodwill over the years through its purchases of media outlets
                                   and media content. Goodwill is not a good item to have on a balance sheet since it arrives there
                                   only when a firm pays “too much” for another firm.

                                   Competitors
                                   Disney competes directly with NBC, Universal Pictures, Paramount Pictures, Time Warner,
                                   CBS Corp., News Corp., Carnival Corp., and Royal Caribbean—and indirectly with all family
                                   entertainment-oriented businesses globally. In essence, all hotels, restaurants, water parks, and
                                   attractions anywhere near Disney’s 14 theme parks are rival businesses, such as Florida-based Sea
                                   World, Marineland, and Silver Springs. In China, a large, new state-run theme park has opened
                                   right beside the new (2015) Disney theme park in Shanghai, China, serving as a major competitor.
                                       Exhibit 6 provides a financial comparison for Disney and several rival firms. Note that
                                   Comcast is larger than Disney.

                                   Comcast Corporation (CMCSA)
                                   The major competitor to Disney World in Orlando is Universal Studios Florida, owned by
                                   Comcast Corporation, headquartered in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Comcast is a media and
                                   technology company operating through five segments: Cable Communications, Cable Networks,
                                   Broadcast Television, Filmed Entertainment, and Theme Parks. The Cable Communications

                                   s­ egment offers video, high-speed Internet, and voice, as well as security and automation services
                                    under the XFINITY brand. This segment also provides Ethernet network services, and cellular
                                    backhaul services to mobile network operators. The cable networks segment operates national
                                    cable networks providing entertainment, news and information, and sports content; regional
                                    sports and news networks; international cable networks; and cable television studio production

                                        Comcast’s Broadcast Television segment operates NBC and Telemundo. NBC broadcasts
                                    many sports including the Olympics, NFL, college football, major golf tournaments, and many
                                    others. The broadcasting arm of the NBC, including sports and other TV shows, did not have a
                                    meaningful change in revenues in 2017 from 2016; like Disney, the difficulty in doing business
                                    in this industry is widespread.
                                        Comcast’s Filmed Entertainment segment produces, acquires, markets, and distributes filmed
                                    entertainment under the Universal Pictures, Illumination, Focus Features, and DreamWorks
                                    Animation names. The company’s theme parks segment operates Universal theme parks in
                                    Orlando, Florida, as well as in Hollywood, California, and Osaka, Japan. Universal parks center
                                    around rides and attractions based on Universal Studios films. A few notable themes at the parks
                                    include The Simpsons and Harry Potter. Revenues from Comcast-owned theme parks doubled
                                    between 2012 and 2017, increasing 8 percent between 2016 and 2017.

               Carnival Corporation (CCL)
               Headquartered in Miami, Florida, Carnival is the world’s number-one cruise operator, owning
               and operating a dozen cruise lines and about 100 ships with a total passenger capacity of more
               than 190,000. Carnival operates in North America, primarily through its Princess Cruise Line,
               Holland America, and Seabourn luxury cruise brand, as well as its flagship Carnival Cruise
               Lines unit. Brands such as AIDA, P&O Cruises, and Costa Cruises offer services to passen-
               gers in Europe, and the Cunard Line runs luxury trans-Atlantic liners. Carnival’s cruise ships
               compete with Disney’s cruise ships. Another large cruise line company, Royal Caribbean, also
               competes with Disney ships. Carnival reported 2017 revenues of $17 billion with profits of $2.6
               billion.

               External Issues
               Cloud Based Society and Cord Cutting
               Gone are the days of VHS and DVDs as on-demand streaming is here to stay. Customers
               today demand instant access to many of their videos and shows on demand. There is also an
               increased cord cutting society where customers are increasingly unwilling to pay for massive
               cable packages where they may only watch a few channels. Netflix, Amazon, Roku, and Disney
               part-owned Hulu, all provide content often called “skinny” packages addressing the video pro-
               gramming the customer wants. Internet delivery as opposed to traditional pay-TV is expected to
               increase to 18 million households by 2021, up from 11 million in 2017.

               International Markets’ Love for American TV shows
               While many Americans are enjoying and watching shows and movies developed in other
               ­nations, the same can be said of people living outside the United States watching and enjoying
                U.S.-based TV shows. As the U.S. market becomes increasingly saturated, firms are increas-
                ingly looking for new markets through market penetration strategies of taking existing products
                to new markets. Of the nearly $40 billion in 2016 box office sales worldwide, over 70 percent
                of the sales were generated outside of the United States and Canada, compared to 64 percent
                of total sales being international 10 years earlier. The trend is not just with movies though,
                U.S.-based TV shows including sitcoms, reality TV, and many others. All four major U.S.
                networks: ABC, CBS, FOX, and NBC, are enjoying exploding opportunities to license their
                ­products in foreign markets. High-speed Internet is growing in developing markets as well,
                 ­providing increased content delivery as more programs move to being viewed in this medium.
                  For example, ­high-speed Internet in Asia is around 46 percent participation, with the Middle
                  East and Latin America around 60 percent each, and Europe at 79 percent. North America, by
                  comparison, enjoys 88 percent high-speed Internet accessibility. One point for strategists to
                  consider in the above data, for example, is in the Middle East—just how many years are the
                  40 percent nonusers from adopting high-speed Internet based on economic and demographic
                  trends in the regions? Nevertheless, the potential for growth in all international markets remains
                  extremely attractive for the large U.S. networks and, to date, it is estimated around two-thirds of
                  all young people in developing countries are active Internet users.

               Video and Media
               The video and media business generates over $40 billion in U.S. revenue annually with growth
               around 2 percent. Disney is the largest player in the industry with a market share of around 18
               percent, followed by NBCUniversial Media and Time Warner Inc. with market shares of 16
               ­percent. 21st Century Fox and Sony Corporation have market shares of around 12 percent each.
                In total, there are nearly 10,000 businesses in this industry, but the top five discussed here ac-
                count for nearly 80 percent of industry revenue. Over half of industry revenues are derived from
                the action and adventure genre with thriller themed programs accounting for 15 percent. Drama

                                   and comedy account for 12 and 8.2 percent of industry revenues, respectively, with the balance
                                   uncategorized. Growth rates in this industry are affected by movie theaters which have under-
                                   gone consolidation in recent years with various movie theater firms trying new strategies of
                                   offering healthy foods, 3D screens, chair back seats, full service meals, and a variety of other op-
                                   tions to attract customers. Disney is not forward integrated into this arena so it depends heavily
                                   on movie theaters being able to attract viewers. Higher ticket prices and large screens at home
                                   have held total attendance in check, which may eventually result in Disney’s less bargaining
                                   power on prices they charge theater companies to show their video programs. Disney and other
                                   producers such as NBCUniversal could possibly form tighter alliances with Hulu, Roku, Netflix
                                   or similar content delivery providers to show movies upon release or even show them on their
                                   own networks. Currently, there remains a lag between when Disney allows new releases to be
                                   shown in mediums other than theaters.

                                   Theme Parks
                                   Theme parks represent one of Disney’s most profitable SBUs, and as a whole, the theme park
                                   industry in the United States accounts for nearly $18 billion in sales. They have enjoyed robust
                                   annual growth of over 5 percent from the bottom of the recession to 2017. Annual growth is ex-
                                   pected at around 2 percent through 2023. Admissions account for nearly 65 percent of revenues
                                   followed by food and beverage and merchandise at around 12 percent each. The balance of rev-
                                   enues are derived from multiple sources. Disney is the top player in the industry, representing a
                                   staggering 50 percent of industry revenues followed by Comcast Corporation’s NBCUniversal
                                   Media, then SeaWorld and Six Flags at 18, 7 and 6 percent, respectively. The remaining 20 per-
                                   cent is derived from over 550 competitors in the industry, many of which are small parks, or a
                                   single large park in one city. The future, however, may be in international markets where Disney
                                   is already growing much more rapidly than they are domestically. Smaller parks likely will find
                                   it increasingly difficult to compete with the likes of Disney and Universal, as huge capital ex-
                                   penses are needed to create rides and as customers increasingly demand new and more modem
                                   attractions, especially if the firm is attempting to get the same customers accustomed to visit
                                   time after time. Advertising to potential international customers is another strategy many theme
                                   park operators are doing to attract new customers to their facilities.

                                   Television Broadcasting
                                   The television broadcasting business in the United States generates over $55 billion in annual
                                   revenue, with 900 businesses directly competing in the industry. Viacom is the industry leader,
                                   responsible for 17 percent of revenues followed by NBCUniversal Media, Disney, and Fox. Half
                                   of the industry revenues are derived from firms not included above, indicating a fragmented
                                   ­industry that could experience consolidation in the future. Dramas account for one-third of
                                    all industry revenue, followed by news programming at 25 percent. Sitcoms account for over
                                    15 percent of industry revenues and have the advantage over dramas in that the viewer can tune
                                    in to a show anytime, without having to have followed previous episodes. On the decline is
                                    reality type shows accounting for 13 percent of revenues, while sports account for 10 percent.
                                    Growth in sports is expected to continue and this should be good news for Disney-owned ABC/
                                    ESPN, as well as rivals NBC, CBS, and Fox.

                                   Future
                                   Disney’s Marvel Studios’ Black Panther movie grossed $201.8 million over its first 3 days in
                                   February 2018, making it one of the top five domestic openings of all time. The film grossed
                                   $242 million over the Presidents’ Day holiday weekend, making it the second highest 4-day
                                   domestic opening of all time. The movie’s international single-day debut grossed $169 ­million.
                                   Black Panther was just the fifth film in industry history to break the $200 million mark in its

               fifth biggest Western industry opening of all time and exceeded in a few days the entire runs
               of Guardians of the Galaxy and Ant-Man. Disney shareholders are hoping Black Panther

               company has numerous superheroes, such as Disney owning the Marvel brand and Time
               Warner owning DC Entertainment. Both companies also are embroiled in enormous merger
               actions. Specifically, Time Warner is considering an $85 million buyout bid from AT&T, while
               Disney wants to buy most of 21st Century Fox for $52 billion, but Disney is in a bidding war
               with Comcast. Disney needs a clear strategic plan to sucessfully combat both Time Warner and
               Comcast.

                                   Headquartered in Herzogenaurach, Germany, adidas AG is a sports apparel and footwear manu-
                                   facturer employing over 62,000 people. It is the parent company of the Adidas Group, which also
                                   includes the Reebok sportswear company. Besides sports footwear, adidas also produces acces-
                                   sories such as bags, shirts, watches, eyewear, and other sports- and clothing-related goods. The
                                   company is the largest sportswear manufacturer in Europe and the second-biggest sportswear
                                   manufacturer in the world, with Nike being the largest.
                                       Across 170 countries, adidas sells sports shoes, apparel, and equipment featuring the com-
                                   pany’s iconic three-stripe logo. Adidas focuses on American football, European football, basket-
                                   ball, running, and training gear and apparel, as well as lifestyle goods such as the SLVR and Y-3
                                   fashion brands. Adidas has three segments: footwear, apparel, and accessories and gear.

                                   History
                                   At the age of 20, Adolf “Adi” Dassler was driven by the goal to produce the most durable and
                                   safest footwear for athletes in different sports. Dassler pursued this vision until his death in
                                   1978. His first shoe back in 1920 was constructed of canvas due to the few materials available
                                   in the post-war period. By the 1930s, Dassler employed around 100 workers and was making 30
                                   different styles of shoes for 11 different sports. After World War II, Dassler found himself once
                                   again making shoes with limited materials, and in 1947, with only 47 workers, he resurrected
                                   shoe manufacturing using canvas and rubber from American fuel tanks. His brother, Rudolf,
                                   founded the rival company Puma, which is also headquartered in Herzogenaurach. Adi Dassler
                                   made the first post-war sports shoes in 1949 and formally registered adidas, which is the first
                                   three letters of his first and last names. To this day, adidas is still referred to as the “Three Stripes
                                   Company.”
                                       Perhaps the earliest and greatest pioneer in sports marketing, Dassler convinced many
                                   famous athletes to endorse his product, including Jessie Owens, Muhammad Ali, and Franz
                                   Beckenbauer. The German football team won the 1954 World Cup wearing adidas shoes with
                                   screw-in studs, spurring the company to develop and promote many new products for major
                                   sporting events.
                                       In January 2006, adidas acquired Reebok International Ltd., furthering the Adidas Group
                                   as one of the top athletic footwear, apparel, and sports hardware producers in the world. In
                                   2008, adidas entered the English cricket market by sponsoring English batting star Kevin
                                   Pietersen. The following year, adidas signed the English player Ian Bell and the Indian
                                   player Ravindra Jadeja. Adidas currently produces and sells cricket bats in the Incurza,
                                   Pellara, and Libro lines; it also manufactures the uniforms worn by both the England and
                                   the Australia cricket teams. Adidas announced in 2020 that it plans to divest Reebok and is
                                   looking for a buyer.

                                   Vision/Mission
                                   Vision Statement
                                   On their corporate website, adidas presents the simple goal of being the world’s leading sports
                                   brand. Though described as a “mission,” this fits better as a vision statement.

                                   Mission Statement
                                   Adidas has not posted a mission statement on its corporate website, so we propose the following:
                                   At adidas we are committed to hiring a globally diverse workforce to design, promote, and sell
                                   top-of-the-line athletic footwear and apparel. We strive to use the latest e-commerce technology
                                   to provide better shopping experiences for our customers globally.

               Internal Issues
               Organizational Structure
               The term “organizational structure” refers to how a firm’s operations are grouped or arranged for
               battle against rival firms. Structure is vital for success. An organizational chart reveals the chain
               of command, showing who reports to whom, and who is responsible for what products, regions,
               and activities. Adidas does not provide an organizational chart or any indication of top executive
               reporting relationships on its corporate website or in its 2020 Annual Report. What is available
               is a mere list of management executives with titles, some of which are vague. However, adidas
               appears to operate utilizing a functional (centralized) organizational structure.
                   As companies such as adidas grow, acquire, and change, alteration of their structure is generally
               needed to maintain or obtain effectiveness. Among the basic types of structure—such as functional,
               divisional, and matrix—a strategic business unit (SBU) structure is based on grouping similar divi-
               sions together within groups. Some analysts contend that adidas should utilize an SBU structure when
               the number, size, and geographic dispersion of segments, divisions, or profit centers in an organization
               increases beyond about 10 (depending on the size and geographic dispersion of the segments).
                   Transitioning to an SBU-type structure can facilitate strategy implementation by improving
               coordination between similar divisions and channeling accountability to distinct business units.
               Exhibit 5 reveals adidas’ current list of top managers and the firm’s organizational structure.
               Note the lack of clear executive titles and the lack of divisional head-persons by region, country,
               or continent, or even by product, both points that suggest a need for adidas to reorganize consis-
               tent with current organizational structure concepts and practice.
                   Adidas’ top executives are listed and arrayed in Exhibit 1. Apparently adidas does not have a
               chief operating officer (COO), nor does the company have presidents of divisions-by-product or
               presidents of divisions-by-region. Some analysts contend that adidas should revamp its organiza-
               tional structure and utilize a design based on strategic business units (SBUs), where the units are
               continents and under each unit top executive are the presidents of various countries, who would
               be responsible for all adidas operations, marketing, and sales in those respective countries.
                   Fifty-five percent of adidas’s employees throughout the firm are women, and 35 percent
               of management positions are held by women. Adidas considers promoting women worldwide
               throughout the company as a prerequisite for promoting women to top management positions.
               Adidas is committed to maintaining a pipeline that is balanced between women and men mov-
               ing forward. Note, however, that currently only one female is listed among the top 7 executives.

               Financial Data and Statements
               Adidas reported a 16 percent revenue decline in fiscal 2020 and a 78 percent net income decline.
               These numbers are extremely concerning for adidas, which blamed COVID-19 in their 2020
               Annual Report. However, Nike, which reports in May each year (instead of January), reported

                                   expense on the income statement increased 72 percent. With less revenue coming in and similar

               Strategy
               Adidas implemented a strategy dubbed “Creating the New” for the 2015 to 2020 period, which
               focused on advancing the desirability of adidas’ brand and proved successful. Adidas’ new strat-
               egy from 2020 to 2025, called “Own the Game,” is similar to the former strategy in that the
               intent is to once again increase brand credibility but also improve the customer experience and
               sustainability. Much of the strategy centers around adidas’ commitment to a digital transforma-
               tion. This digital transformation was accelerated during 2020 as lockdowns were put in place and
               as adidas’ management cut costs, improved operational efficiency, and invested and improved its
               digital capabilities.
                    While adidas actively refers to the above marketing slogans as strategy, what product lines,
               where they are sold, and how they are sold better represent the actual strategy of the firm. The
               two main brands owned by Adidas Group are adidas and Reebok. The adidas brand accounted
               for 91 percent of sales in 2020 while Reebok accounted for only 7 percent. The Group is cur-
               rently in the process of divesting Reebok. Within the adidas brand, the firm is focused on provid-
               ing premium sportswear to its customers around the world. Adidas sponsors many professional
               teams around the world as well as many top college teams in the United States across virtually
               all sports. The brand provides footwear, apparel, and accessories and gear as product options.
                    Notable events sponsored by adidas include the FIFA Women’s World Cup, the Rugby World
               Cup, the UEFA Champions League, and both the Boston and the Berlin marathons. A sam-
               pling of sports teams sponsored includes the national football teams of Argentina, Germany,
               and Spain; top football clubs Juventus, Real Madrid, and Flamengo Rio de Janerio; and the
               All Blacks in rugby. Top American universities include the University of Miami, Arizona State
               University, and Texas A&M University. Texas A&M, for example, is valued at $541 million, but
               there are 11 university sports teams in the United States that are valued higher, with the top brand
               being the University of Texas, which is valued at $1.1 billion and sponsored by Nike. Rivals Nike
               and Under Armour (UA) have contracts with many American college teams.
                    As of 2020, Real Madrid and Barcelona are the most valued football teams in the world, both
               with a value of $4.7 billion. Keep in mind, however, that the 15th most valuable football team,
               Everton, is valued at $658 million, and the 15th most valuable college team in the United States,
               Nebraska, is valued at $472 billion. There are over 100 top university teams competing in the top
               division in the United States, leaving a huge opportunity for adidas.
                    Top football athletes who are sponsored by adidas include Lionel Messi, Mohamed Salah,
               the retired David Beckham, and Wendie Renard. Top adidas-sponsored basketball players in-
               clude Candace Parker, Donovan Mitchell, and James Harden; top American football players in-
               clude Aaron Rodgers and Patrick Mahomes; baseball players include Aaron Judge and Carlos
               Correa; and tennis stars include Alexander Zverev, Angelique Kerber, and Dominic Thiem. Note
               that while Lionel Messi, Candace Parker, and Aaron Rodgers are three of the biggest names
               in their respective sports, many of the top superstar athletes in the world are not sponsored by
               ­adidas—this is one area where Nike has always excelled. In total, of the 19 top global endorse-
                ment deals in 2020, adidas sponsored 2 and Reebok sponsored 1 while Nike sponsored 9 and
                Under Armour sponsored 2.

    520    STRATEGIC-MANAGEMENT CASE ANALYSIS

                                   Sales by Channel
                                   Adidas is in a process of improving its e-commerce presence as a means of increasing direct sales
                                   to consumers. E-commerce has many benefits, including the convenience of shopping from home,
                                   more impulse purchasing, and significantly less cost (as no retail stores are needed). In addition,
                                   selling directly to the consumer provides deep marketing analytic possibilities. In 2020, 41 percent
                                   of adidas’s sales were derived from direct-to-the-consumer methods, with about 21 percent from
                                   e-commerce, and 20 percent from adidas’ own retail stores, which total over 2,500 worldwide.
                                   Wholesale revenues account for 59 percent of sales. Wholesale has the benefit of adidas using
                                   other firms’ fixed assets, advertising, and other expenses to sell its products. Be sure to note that
                                   e-commerce sales represented 33 percent of sales, or $7.9 billion, in 2019, while in 2020, adidas
                                   reported that 41 percent of direct-to-the-consumer sales netted $8.1 billion in sales. COVID-19
                                   may can explain part of the online growth, but adidas appears committed to online sales.

                                   By-Segment Information
                                   Exhibit 4 shows adidas’ 2020 revenues by product lines. Note that footwear accounted for about
                                   56 percent of revenues in both 2019 and 2020, with accessories and gear accounting for about 5
                                   percent. Adidas manufactures both men and women’s shoes for most of the major sports as well
                                   as for leisure activities such as running and walking. In addition, the firm makes shoes designed
                                   for hiking and skateboarding, and even sandals. Adidas also produces apparel such as shorts,
                                   pants, t-shirts, jerseys, jackets, hoodies, socks, and underwear. Accessories include balls, gloves,
                                   hats, even phone cases. Adidas used to own TaylorMade and had a larger presence in golf and
                                   hockey, but the firm has since diverted its resources to other revenue streams.

                                   Exhibit 5 reveals that adidas has excellent geographic coverage, deriving substantial revenues
                                   from Asia, Europe, and North America. However, adidas trails Nike by quite a margin in the U.S.
                                   market.

                                   E-commerce Becoming the New Normal
                                   During 2020, e-commerce sales nearly doubled globally, from 16 percent to 29 percent. McKinsey
                                   predicts 2021 and beyond will see huge booms for e-commerce, and 70 percent of executives are
                                   projecting growth of up to 20 percent annually in 2021 and 2022 in their digital outlets. China
                                   is predicted to be the leader in e-commerce gains, followed by Europe and the United States.

               Zara, for example, plans to close 1,200 stores from 2021 to early 2023 and reroute $3.2 billion to
               its digital transformation. Top adidas rival Nike has also pledged to accelerate its movement to a
               digital strategy. Consumers are valuing time and convenience more than ever, and good service
               firms that do not compete heavily in e-commerce are at a severe disadvantage. In fact, in 2020,
               25 percent of all shoes sold in the United States were derived from online retailers, which is par-
               ticularly interesting for a product that many people want to try on before purchase.

               Athleisure Clothing & Athletic Footwear
               In 2015, Athleisure, a term coined for athletic clothing worn in normal day-to-day activities,
               started to become popular across the world. Celebrity endorsements and a growing concern for
               global wellness has spurred demand for this segment, but many people who are not particu-
               larly active or overly concerned with wellness also find this type of clothing more comfortable.
               Among footwear categories, sport leisure products outperformed performance footwear sales in
               the United States in 2020. Forbes forecasted in 2019 that dressier fashion-type shoes would be
               replaced by higher sales of athleisure footwear in 2020.
                   The global athletic footwear business, which includes running, walking, hiking, and sports
               shoes, is estimated to be worth $72 billion in 2020 and expected to grow to over $100 billion by
               2027, but some reports project $120 billion by 2027. Running shoes alone are expected to ac-
               count for nearly $40 billion by 2027. In 2020, the U.S. market accounted for nearly 27 percent
               of the global market with over $19 billion, while China, the world’s second largest economy,
               is expected to reach $19 billion by 2026 and grow nearly 8 percent through 2027. By contrast,
               Japan is expected to grow 2.7 percent and Germany to grow 3.4 percent over the same period.
                   Like athleisure clothing, athletic footwear is increasingly being used by people around the
               world for casual, day-to-day activities. Developments in new materials and technology have
               made this class of shoes extremely comfortable, but it has also increased the costs and compli-
               cated development of the shoes. This segment overall is expected to occupy 40 percent of the
               entire shoe industry revenue by 2025.

               Brand Polygamists
               There is a growing trend in the industry where customers are showing lower brand loyalty, lead-
               ing industry analysts to label them “brand polygamists.” Firms like adidas and Nike have spent
               significant capital and resources to promote their brands, and a decrease in loyalty would be a se-
               rious problem. This is particularly true for top firms like adidas and Nike, who have much more
               to lose. So what motivates customers if not the brand name? Today, many customers are basing
               their purchases on product features and price. In fact, in some cases a logo can even detract
               from a purchase. Companies like Nike have established the NikeiD program where shoppers can

                                   customize their own products. However, policies such as these are expensive, and the products
                                   sold have a smaller margin. Thanks to the trends of less brand loyalty and more e-commerce,
                                   startup firms can compete much more easily now. The global brands may have to start a period of
                                   acquisitions to eliminate the competition, as seen in many other industries.

                                   Competitors
                                   Nike
                                   In January 2020, Nike hired John Donahoe as their new CEO to lead the largest sports apparel
                                   company in the world. Nike serves athletic clubs, universities, fitness-minded people, and many
                                   others. According to CEO Donahoe in his letter to the shareholders in 2020, Nike is the number
                                   one favorite brand in all 12 of the key cities identified by it as the most important for business.
                                   The majority of Nike’s products are tailored to specific sports, from shoes to shorts, and of course
                                   equipment. Nike owns the Converse brand, Chuck Taylor, All Star, Star Chevron, and Jack Purcell.
                                   Converse’s financials are, however, reported as a separate division but are still included in Nike’s
                                   overall bottom line.
                                       As mentioned above, Nike excels in hiring famous athletes to market their brands; Michael
                                   Jordan, LeBron James, and Cristiano Ronaldo have currently signed lifetime endorsement deals.
                                   In fact, in 2020, four of the five largest endorsement deals were controlled by Nike, and rival
                                   adidas had the fourth highest deal of the five in Lionel Messi.
                                       Nike operates 338 stores in the United States and 758 stores in 45 countries. Nike’s products
                                   are, of course, sold in retail stores the world over. Nike reported revenues of over $37 ­billion in
                                   2020. Exhibit 6 below provides data on Nike’s revenue over the same three product lines adidas
                                   offers. It is interesting to note that, if a $1.20 = €1.00 conversion were used, adidas would report
                                   $9.224 billion for their apparel business in 2020 and $1.234 billion for their accessories and gear
                                   business, both quite close to Nike’s performance. Where Nike really crushes adidas is footwear. At
                                   Nike, 41 percent of companywide sales are derived from North America; 26 percent from Europe,
                                   Middle East, and Africa; 19 percent from China; and 14 percent from the rest of the world.

                                   Puma is a German company that traces its roots to a quarrel between the two founding brothers of
                                   adidas over the direction of the company, which ended with one of them leaving adidas and start-
                                   ing Puma. Like other rivals, Puma is devoting much of their strategy to focusing on digital capa-
                                   bilities. Puma is a leader regarding women in management; 43 percent of management positions

               are held by women. Pages 25–90 of Puma’s 2020 Annual Report are devoted to environmental
               sustainability, demonstrating in great detail what Puma is doing to present itself as a green cor-
               porate player. In 2020, Puma signed up football star Neymar da Silva Santos Júnior, basketball
               player LaMelo Ball, Dutch football club PSV Eindhoven, and Ukrainian club Shakhtar Donetsk.
               Puma also signed up English singer Dua Lipa as a women’s ambassador and Canadian model
               Winnie Harlow. J-Cole, a Grammy-winning artist, was also signed on.
                   Signing celebrities who are not also sports stars is an interesting strategy for Puma. Puma is
               in the process of a brand transformation, yet its mission is to become the fastest-growing sports
               brand in the world. To help implement this strategy, the firm has six strategic focus points: creat-
               ing brand heat, focus on the correct product ranges, comprehensive offers for women, improve-
               ment in distribution, increases in speed and efficiency, and strengthening of the firm’s position in
               North America with its reentry into basketball.
                   A key new Puma distribution center in Indianapolis will allow U.S. customers to be served
               within 2 days, and a new warehouse in Geiselwind, Germany, opened in 2021 to help serve
               the European market. In 2020, Puma reported revenues from footwear, apparel, and accessories
               of €2.368 billion, €1.974 billion, and €893 million, respectively. While Puma is significantly
               smaller than the top players in the industry, its percent of revenue derived from apparel is much
               more than both Nike and adidas. Puma is also fairly balanced on the markets it serves, with 37
               percent, 34 percent, and 20 percent of revenue in 2020 being derived from Europe, Middle East
               and Africa; the Americas; and Asia, respectively.

               Under Armour
               Headquartered in Baltimore, Maryland, Under Armour (UA) was founded in 1996 by a former
               University of Maryland football player who desired a t-shirt that would whisk away perspiration
               rather than get soggy. UA today is a top firm in the athletic clothing industry and is worn by
               some of the largest American college football and European football teams. The former include
               Auburn University and The University of South Carolina; the latter include Tottenham Hotspur,
               Aris F.C., and Deportivo Toluca F.C. UA employs superstar athletes such as American football
               mega stars Tom Brady and Cam Newton, baseball star Bryce Harper, and the possibly the most
               famous Olympic swimmer of all times, Michael Phelps.
                   Like the other firms disused in the case, UA produces footwear, apparel, and accessories.
               UA were once unique in offering three styles: compression, fitted, and loose, for various weather
               conditions. Rival firms have since adapted many UA features into their own clothing. However,
               UA has trademarked products, such as HEATGEAR, COLDGEAR, and UA HOVR. An interest-
               ing difference between UA and its rivals is its continuity since its founding, with the majority of
               sales still derived from apparel—64 percent of all 2020 sales were in this category. Footwear and
               accessories accounted for 21 and 9 percent of UA’s 2020 revenues, respectively.

               Conclusion
               Strategy Considerations
               Adidas competes in an extremely competitive industry and is in desperate need of an effective
               strategic plan. During fiscal 2020, adidas by some measures performed poorly compared to Nike,
               UA, and Puma, which may signal that other aspects of the company are weak, perhaps even the
               company’s organizational structure, as indicated in the case. Top considerations when designing
               a proposed strategic plan for adidas will include how to allocate resources across the three divi-
               sions of footwear, apparel, and accessories. Recall from the case that adidas was once strong in
               golf but has since divested this business. Should adidas double down its efforts in a particular
               sport or cater to a wide range of sports? Additionally, should adidas spend more on hiring key
               sports stars to endorse their products?
                   What global markets should adidas shift resources to or invest more in? Nike is killing adidas
               in the U.S. market. Recall from the case that athletic wear is becoming increasingly popular attire
               even in day-to-day activities. German rival Puma has seized on this opportunity by hiring models
               and talented musicians to promote their brands. How should adidas balance its new e-commerce
               strategy with the traditional store strategy? Is it too early for adidas to move similarly significant
               resources to e-commerce? Should adidas acquire new startup firms as the case mentioned in

                                   passing? Is it wise for adidas to divest itself of Reebok as planned? What type of organizational
                                   structure would be best for adidas? As indicated in the case, structure matters tremendously for
                                   overall success and effectiveness.
                                        The above ideas and suggestions are not all-inclusive or even all-important. The most im-
                                   portant factors and considerations will be derived from reading the case and doing your own
                                   research. When preparing the 3-year plan for adidas, be sure to provide recommendations based
                                   on what direction you feel the company should pursue moving forward. Be careful not to re-
                                   port what adidas is currently doing or what you think they are going to do based on company
                                   literature, unless of course you agree with this stance based on a comprehensive analysis. The
                                   firm experienced a 78 percent drop in net income in 2020, and shareholders are worried. Know
                                   that in the business world, shareholders in general expect at least a 4 to 5 percent annual growth
                                   in the top line (revenues) and bottom line (net income), and adidas’s failure here could lead to
                                   shareholder abandonment. Adidas needs to avoid disastrous years even during times of distress,
                                   as experienced in 2020. Excuses don’t cut it in business.

               Headquartered in Brackenfell, Western Cape, South Africa, Shoprite Holdings Ltd. (Shoprite) is
               Africa’s largest retail supermarket, with 17 brands serving 14 countries through 2,387 corporate
               stores and 505 franchise outlets. Shoprite Holdings’ brands include Shoprite, Usave (also spelled
               USave and U$save), Checkers, LiquorShop, House & Home, Medirite, and MoneyMarket.
               Shoprite employs over 140,000 across its total range and is the largest private sector employer in
               South Africa. Over 24 million people shop in Shoprite properties every day.
                   Shoprite differentiates itself based on high volume of sales and a variety of brands and formats.
               The company is committed to serving underserved markets, becoming more digital, and having a
               lean cost structure. Shoprite offers customers a place to not only buy food but also to purchase fur-
               niture, pay bills, pay for funereal services, buy medicine, and much more. Since the firm’s humble
               founding in 1979, the firm has stuck to its initial vision and mission to provide quality products
               and a quality shopping experience. With its beginnings in South Africa but now expanding over
               much of the African continent, Shoprite serves all customer types, from low to high income, with
               different store concepts. The firm reported revenues in excess of ZAR 156 billion in 2020.

               History
               Shoprite was founded in 1979 when an 8-store Western Cape grocery chain, also named Shoprite,
               was purchased by PEP Stores. Right away, the upper management declared that the mission of
               the new grocery store was to cater to low- to middle-income shoppers and grow through acquisi-
               tions. Through much of the 1980s, Shoprite expanded slowly across South Africa before enter-
               ing Namibia in 1990. In 1991, Shoprite purchased Checkers, and in 1997 the firm expanded by
               acquiring OK Furniture and House & Home.
                   In the early 2000s, Shoprite began operations in Zimbabwe and Egypt and opened the first
               Usave in 2001. In 2008, Shoprite was added to the Johannesburg Top 40 index of blue-chip
               stocks, and by 2009, it was South Africa’s largest chain by market value. Over the last 10 years,
               Shoprite has expanded further across Africa, opening many new stores and adding many new
               product lines to existing stores, earning Shoprite the distinction of South Africa’s largest retailer
               in 2019 and a ranking of 89th in Deloitte’s Global Powers of Retailing 2021 report.

               Internal Issues
               Organizational Structure
               The term “organizational structure” refers to how a firm’s operations are grouped or arranged
               for battle against rival firms. Structure is vital for success in any firm. An organizational chart
               reveals the chain of command, showing who reports to whom and who is responsible for what

                                   vides an organizational chart or any indication of top executive reporting relationships. Based on
                                   a list of management executives with titles, some of which are vague, Shoprite appears to operate
                                   utilizing a functional (centralized) organizational structure, but this would be ineffective for such
                                   a large, geographically dispersed company.
                                        As companies such as Shoprite grow, acquire, and change, alteration of their structure is
                                   generally needed to maintain or obtain effectiveness. Among the basic types of structure—
                                   such as functional, divisional, and matrix—a strategic business unit (SBU) structure is based
                                   on grouping similar divisions together within groups. Some analysts would contend that
                                   Shoprite should be utilizing an SBU structure because this type of design is especially useful
                                   when the number, size, and geographic dispersion of segments, divisions, or profit centers
                                   in a firm is roughly greater than 10 (depending on the size and geographic dispersion of the
                                   segments). Transitioning to an SBU-type structure could facilitate strategy implementation by
                                   improving coordination between similar divisions and channeling accountability to distinct
                                   business units.
                                        Exhibit 1 reveals Shoprite’s current list of top managers and the firm’s organizational struc-
                                   ture. Note the lack of clear executive titles and the lack of divisional head persons, both of which
                                   suggest a need for Shoprite to reorganize based on current organizational structure concepts and
                                   practices.

                                   Note in Exhibit 2 that Shoprite experienced a 6 percent increase in revenues in 2020 but a 3 per-
                                   cent drop in net income. This is an ongoing problem for firms currently competing across Africa,
                                   as droughts, pandemics, unemployment, and other factors restrict what can be charged for goods
                                   and services, cutting into profit margins. It is worthy of note that net income/revenues for 2019
                                   were approximately 2.4 percent, but for 2020 the number dropped to 2.2 percent. These numbers
                                   may not seem like much, but the math results in a drop in net profit margin of over 8 percent from
                                   2019 to 2020—this is a negative trend that bears monitoring.
                                       Exhibit 3 provides summarized balance sheets for 2019 and 2020 for Shoprite. Take note of
                                   the large increase in cash in fiscal 2020, which can possibly be partly explained by limited inven-
                                   tory in 2020 and by a reduction in plant, property, and equipment (PP&E), which may indicate
                                   a sale of some existing properties from 2019. In addition, note the zero goodwill on the balance
                                   sheet. Shoprite has a history of acquiring other grocery stores, so this is a positive sign that man-
                                   agement has strong negotiation skills when purchasing rival firms.

    528    STRATEGIC-MANAGEMENT CASE ANALYSIS

                                   Strategy
                                   Shoprite describes their strategy as growth focused on optimization of the firm’s retail stores
                                   in existing markets. This choice is quite interesting, as firms have many strategic options, in-
                                   cluding expansion into new geographic areas, expansion of new products in the same areas,
                                   or simply attempting to gain a larger market share in current markets with current products.
                                   Shoprite hopes to execute its strategy by focusing more on existing markets and existing cus-
                                   tomers and by becoming more innovative. Shoprite suggests it will implement this strategy
                                   by focusing on three key areas: 1) a smarter Shoprite, 2) closing the gap in key segments, and
                                   3) winning the long term. Reading more closely, though, Shoprite is clearly more aggressive
                                   than this would imply.
                                       Shoprite plans to execute the “smarter Shoprite” prong by being customer-first, developing
                                   new channels, and improving its precision retailing. Reading the Annual Report, it is clear that
                                   being customer-first means that Shoprite intends to use data provided from customers to target
                                   them more effectively and profitably.
                                       Shoprite is often voted first for lowest prices and Checkers first for best value. In 2020,
                                   Checkers established the Xtra Saving Rewards Programme, and over 5 million customers
                                   joined. Shoprite is focusing on “future fit channels,” which refers to its goal of increasing
                                   omnichannel shopping options for customers, possibly allowing customers to order products
                                   from home for pick-up at the store. In 2019, online sales increased by 386 percent, and Sizty60
                                   was launched in 2020 for home delivery with 87 stores participating by the end of the year.
                                   Precision retailing, similar to the customer-first concept, utilizes data analytics to improve
                                   business decisions; 57 products categories were successfully optimized soon after the start of
                                   this new program.
                                       By closing the gap in key segments, Shoprite seeks to improve its private labels, increase its
                                   market share in premium food and fresh food, and provide stronger franchise offers. In 2019,
                                   1,251 new private label products were offered, and an additional 828 new private labels were
                                   added in 2020. To grow in premium and fresh food, Shoprite relies on its Checkers FreshX
                                   concept stores as well as the addition of fresh products to existing store types. Over 220 fresh
                                   product pipelines were established in the first half of 2021. A less publicized fact is that Shoprite
                                   offers franchises and is currently improving its franchise offerings. In 2021, Shoprite had almost
                                   completed its full supply chain integration; this will likely improve delivery for franchise owners
                                   and allow increased profit for Shoprite corporate.
                                       The third prong of Shoprite’s reported strategy is winning the long term. It plans to do so by
                                   continuously evaluating this position in Africa, refocusing capital allocation, and determining
                                   sources of alternative revenue. As mentioned earlier, Shoprite has not announced plans to expand
                                   beyond Africa. In 2019, Shoprite ventured outside South Africa to open 14 stores in the conti-
                                   nent, and in 2021 it started a program that will tailor business models to conditions in particular
                                   markets within Africa. Shoprite is currently shifting toward smaller stores located closer to their
                                   customers; it opened 23 such Usave stores in 2019 and a huge 105,000-square-meter distribution
                                   center in 2018 while building a different series of distribution centers in 2020. Part of this refo-
                                   cusing of capital allocation is likely to center around Shoprite’s needs in terms of fully integrated
                                   supply chains.
                                       Shoprite plans to unlock alternative revenue streams through data analytics. In 2018, Shoprite
                                   started a program where customers could upload money onto a Shoprite wallet and use the funds
                                   in a Shoprite store. Its new K’nect stores allow customers to purchase cellular products and ac-
                                   cessories. In 2020, Shoprite started a partnership that will provide customers a means of buying
                                   funeral coverage within Shoprite stores.

                                   By-Segment Information
                                   Exhibit 4 shows that approximately 78 percent of 2020 sales were derived from Shoprite markets
                                   in South Africa, which include LiquorShop and K’nect. While Shoprite serves 15 countries in
                                   Africa, the firm is predominantly based in South Africa. The firm says that it employs a cost-
                                   leadership strategy. Shoprite supermarkets hold 32 percent of the formal food retail market in
                                   South Africa.
                                       Exhibit 5 shows that nearly half of the 2,829 total stores owned by Shoprite are supermarkets;
                                   683 of the total of 1,387 supermarkets are Shoprite branded, 425 are Usave, 233 are Checkers,
                                   and 37 are Checkers Hyper. Furniture stores accounted for a total of 442 stores and are split

               Shoprite
               Shoprite is the largest business of the Shoprite Group portfolio, both in number of stores (503
               stores as of 2020) and in revenues. The supermarkets are full-service and offer one-stop shop-
               ping for many items, including basics such as food, drinks, and household goods as well as
               prescription medicine, funeral arrangements, bills payments, and even government payouts. The
               store’s busiest times of the month are the middle and the end of the month, corresponding to most
               pay-checks and government social grant pay dates.

               Checkers and Checkers Hyper
               Focused on the more affluent customer, Checkers and Checkers Hyper accounts for 261 super-
               markets. Shoprite senior management is making a commitment to this branch of the business as
               they feel the firm is underserving consumers looking for more upscale grocery items as well as
               customers with the disposable income to shop at such stores. FreshX stores are also considered
               premium stores tailored to a specific customer type, in particular the premium consumer seg-
               ment that enjoys fresh markets. The main driver of FreshX is healthier options rather than simply
               being more upscale.

    530    STRATEGIC-MANAGEMENT CASE ANALYSIS

                                   USave
                                   Shoprite’s small-grocery-store-with-limited-items concept is Usave, often spelled U$ave or even
                                   USave. Similar to Checkers and Checkers Hyper, the USave concept also serves underserved
                                   communities but generally caters to more rural or less-affluent communities. The USave brand
                                   is associated with convenience of location and cheaper prices. The concept has even expanded
                                   to include trucks, often referred to as eKasi truck stores, that are able to travel to regions of need
                                   during times of distress. Fourteen new USave stores, seven eKasi truck stores and six eKasi con-
                                   tainer stores opened in 2020.

                                   Other Stores
                                   Shoprite also operates OK franchise and its liquor and furniture stores. The OK concept allows
                                   entrepreneurs across Africa to open their own business with the backing of a trusted brand. In
                                   2020, 17 such stores were opened, and there were plans to open 24 by the end of 2021. There are
                                   currently 500 LiquorShop stores in South Africa, generally found near a Shoprite or Checkers
                                   store. Shoprite plans to expand and grow the Liquor concept in the future. House & Home has
                                   41 South African stores and serves middle- to upper-class customers while OK Furniture, with
                                   314 stores in South Africa and 83 in the rest of Africa, serves mostly middle-income customers.
                                   Customers can purchase beds, appliances, furniture, and many other items at both store concepts.

                                   External Issues
                                   Regions Served
                                   Exhibit 6 reveals the South African grocery market’s expected growth up to 2025. Historically,
                                   growth in this segment has been 1–1.5 percent annually, but now, growth in the higher-end
                                   grocery business is expected to be 48 percent into 2025, which is just over 8 percent annually
                                   when taking compounding into account. Note that the middle-priced grocery options are a smaller
                                   market and are expected to grow less than the other two categories. Value-based grocery options
                                   are expected to grow 36 percent through 2025, or about 6.33 percent annually when adjusted for
                                   compounding. Keep in mind, though, that 62 percent of all growth will come from the value-
                                   based grocery concept in South Africa through 2025. Note as well that data on profit margins
                                   are limited, and it would be wise to research which stores—high-quality, middle-quality, or
                                   high-value—have the larger profit margins before deciding how to expand further.

                                   Nature of Customers in the Regions
                                   Customers in much of sub-Saharan Africa, including South Africa, tend to have limited incomes
                                   and budgets due to adverse weather conditions, pandemics, governmental challenges, high unem-
                                   ployment, and other reasons. These external issues place a tremendous strain on businesses oper-
                                   ating in these regions; customers simply cannot afford to spend as much as is needed to operate
                                   for the businesses to be profitable. As a result, virtually all businesses serving such communities

               have become experts on operational efficiencies. Due to lack of fuel and lack of the means to buy
               fuel when it is available, there is a greater need to open smaller grocery shops near the customer;
               however, this places a higher financial burden on companies. Nevertheless, convenience is more
               important than ever, and many firms are seizing the opportunity to locate smaller stores close to
               the consumer. One interesting development that may run counter to the trend of having stores
               close to home is customers making less frequent trips to the grocery stores, opting instead to
               purchase many items less frequently and expecting stores to offer one-stop shopping and a wide
               range of products. Across the regions served by Shoprite, many customers are increasingly valu-
               ing online shopping even for grocery items.

               Nature of Select Markets
               The food and grocery market in South Africa was valued at about ZAR 900 billion in 2021, with
               a 60/40 ratio of formal-to-informal grocery market. The four largest grocery retailers in South
               Africa account for 50 percent of the market share. The informal market, accounting for 40 per-
               cent, are small mom-and-pop shops that could be purchased if desired. Alternatively, if a large
               firm like Shoprite or Pick n Pay simply placed a smaller grocery store concept in these locations,
               it would likely place tremendous pressure on the smaller stores.
                   Zambia is currently enduring a prolonged drought, which has placed tremendous pressure
               on this country, especially because the nation relies on hydroelectric power. The drought has
               lowered the prices of copper, one of Zambia’s major products, which in turn has put tremendous
               pressure on the employment rate. Zambia’s GDP is projected to grow less than 1 percent in 2021
               compared to Zimbabwe’s nearly 4 percent expected growth. However, Zimbabwe is currently
               experiencing a weak currency due to hyperinflation. Fuel shortages and a drought, with water
               and power shortages like Zambia’s, make business difficult in Zimbabwe. In 2020, for example,
               30 Zimbabwe dollars were equal to 1 USD; one year later 115 Zimbabwe dollars equaled 1 USD.

               Demand for Healthy Food
               There is growing demand globally for healthy food options. Generally, consumers consider
               foods healthy if they are gluten-free, natural, organic, and without “genetic modification,” but
               lower fat and lower sugar is also considered healthy. However, most of all, consumers like food
               that is tasty and convenient. Many consumers in the markets served by Shoprite eat at home, so
               convenience plays a large factor in what is purchased, which includes salty and sweet snacks
               with a long shelf life. Nevertheless, companies such as Shoprite should be mindful of growing
               healthy eating trends and consider offering more high-protein, plant-based, dairy-free snacks. In
               fact, 31 percent of people in South Africa claim they always try to eat healthy and consider veg-
               etables and fruits to be the healthiest options. Despite the growing trends globally of plant-based
               diets, over 35 percent of South Africans surveyed indicated they do not know what a plant-based
               diet refers to. The good news for residents in South Africa is that over 80 percent feel it is easier
               to find healthy food option now compared to 2015, but like many people around the world, about
               half of the population do not consider healthy food affordable.

               South African Eating Habits
               A study by Nielsen in 2021 revealed that 84 percent of South Africans eat meat nearly every
               day. Meat consumption is higher for consumers who live in urban areas. People in rural areas
               also eat meat but include a higher percentage (based on total calories) of grains and vegetables
               in their diets. In fact, 41 percent of the typical South African plate consist of starch; 26 percent,
               meat; 13 percent, vegetables; 8 percent, dairy; and 12 percent, miscellaneous food categories.
               However, for healthy living it is recommended that 12 percent be derived from meat, 33 percent
               from vegetables, and 32 percent from starch. Perhaps surprisingly, researchers at the University
               of Cambridge recommend that 15 percent of plate composition be derived from dairy.
                   The most popular meats in South Africa are poultry, red meat, seafood, and pork, consumed
               by 92, 83, 53, and 45 percent, respectively. Nearly 98 percent of the population eats some type of
               meat, but beans are the most commonly used meat replacement, eaten by 66 percent of the popu-
               lation. In starches, bread, rice, and potatoes are the most commonly eaten, at 93, 88, and 80 per-
               cent, respectively. Green beans and cauliflower are considered starch replacements and are eaten
               by over 30 percent of the population. However, about 50 percent of the population cannot afford

                                   Massmart
                                   Massmart is a South Africa–based retailer of consumer goods. Considered the leading retailer
                                   of general merchandise, it also sells liquor, home improvement goods, supplies, and basic food
                                   products. With 423 stores in sub-Saharian Africa across 13 countries, the firm trades on the
                                   Johannesburg Stock Exchange. Notable countries with Massmart stores include South Africa,
                                   Zambia, Namibia, Nigeria, and Ghana. The firm operates under a high-volume, low-expense
                                   model to best serve the majority of its customers.
                                       Massmart is owned 53 percent by U.S. retail giant Walmart. The firm is broken into four divi-
                                   sions. Massdiscounters, focusing on general merchandise and discounted grocery foods, has the
                                   largest number of stores, with ZAR 20 billion of revenues in 2019. Masswarehouse, Massbuild,
                                   and Masscash are the other three divisions. The Masscash includes Cambridge Food and re-
                                   ported sales ZAR 30 billion in 2019.

                                   Pick n Pay Group
                                   The Pick n Pay Group is the second largest grocery store chain in South Africa behind Shoprite.
                                   The firm was founded in 1967 and has about 2,000 locations. The firm has locations in 8 coun-
                                   tries in Africa plus a 49 percent stake in a Zimbabwean supermarket business. With 1,831 stores
                                   in South Africa, this market dominates the Pick n Pay portfolio. Zimbabwe is next, with 61 stores,
                                   followed by Namibia, with 36. In March 2021, the first Pick n Pay store opened in Nigeria, a
                                   market that rival Shoprite is looking to exit. A notable exception for Pick n Pay is Egypt, where
                                   the firm has no locations.
                                       Like Shoprite, Pick n Pay stores are both franchise-owned and company-owned. The firm
                                   currently operates 830 company-owned and 761 franchise-owned stores. The firm prides itself
                                   on its three pillars to business success: “consumer sovereignty, doing good is good business,
                                   and maximizing business efficiency.” The Pick n Pay Group has three store formats: Pick n Pay,
                                   Boxer, and TM Supermarkets. Pick n Pay stores sell clothing, liquor, and pharmaceutical prod-
                                   ucts in addition to food. The Boxer concept stores sell liquor and offer Boxer Punch, which are
                                   smaller-­footprint grocery stores, and Boxer Build, which are stores that offer home improve-
                                   ment products and food. In addition, Pick n Pay operates a large online grocery platform in
                                   sub-Saharan Africa.
                                       Boxer is South Africa’s fastest growing discount supermarket chain, focusing on the lower
                                   to middle class. Boxer is enjoying double-digit sales growth through its range of 3,000 products,
                                   which include fresh meat and produce offered at unbeatable prices. In 2020, 13 supermarkets
                                   and 5 liquor stores were converted to Boxer stores. The Pick n Pay Group estimates their market
                                   share in South Africa at 16 percent, and the management says the company is underrepresented
                                   in the value-based grocery store chains.

                                   Conclusion
                                   Strategy Considerations
                                   Shoprite operates mostly in South Africa but has operations in many other African countries,
                                   including Egypt. The firm derives most of its revenues from the grocery business but has ex-
                                   panded its operations to include financial services, home improvement, funeral services, and
                                   much more. CEO Engelbrecht is in desperate need of a clear strategic plan moving forward.
                                   Currently, the trend in the grocery industry in Africa is to cut costs in every way possible,
                                   though margins are slim. Do you agree with this cost-cutting tactic? In addition, what would
                                   you recommend CEO Engelbrecht do with respect to new stores? Would it be more profitable
                                   to build smaller stores closer to the consumer with fewer options or build larger stores where
                                   the consumer can purchase everything they need, but which would require travel further from
                                   home? Recall that many in South Africa are dependent on checks from the government twice
                                   a month to purchase the products they need. Would this situation lend itself to larger stores in
                                   central locations?

                   What markets should Shoprite expand into? Do you agree with the divesture from the
               Nigeria market? Recall that rival Pick n Pay is looking to expand into this same market. When
               developing a strategic plan for Shoprite, be sure to provide solutions for what you feel is the
               best direction for the firm moving forward. These recommendations may not be what Shoprite
               is currently doing or what the latest news releases suggest Shoprite plans to do. The firm is in
               desperate need of a detailed strategic plan as it competes in a difficult region of the world for
               profitable business.

                                   Headquartered in Bella Vista, New South Wales, Australia, the Woolworths Group has 215,000
                                   employees working in its network of 3,357 stores. The firm reported nearly AU$64 billion in fis-
                                   cal 2020. The company is part of the highly competitive grocery business in Australia, with its
                                   top rival being Coles. Together, they dominate the market, with Woolworths enjoying 37 percent
                                   and Coles taking 28 percent of the market.
                                       Woolworths is structured with several divisions, which include Australia Food, New Zealand
                                   Food, Online Foods, Drinks, and Hotels. In 2019, Woolworths divested a petroleum business.

                                   History
                                   Five Australian entrepreneurs—Percy Christmas, Stanley Chatterton, Cecil Scott Waine, George
                                   Creed, and Ernest Williams—founded Woolworths on September 22, 1924. Woolworths opened
                                   its first store in December 1924, then named Woolworths Stupendous Bargain Basement and
                                   located in Sydney’s Imperial Arcade. The company’s first CEO, Percy Christmas, described the
                                   first store opening thus: “Every city needs a Woolworths: Sydney has it now. Every man, woman,
                                   and child needs a handy place where good things are cheap.”
                                        A second Woolworths store opened in 1927. The company solely used newspapers for ad-
                                   vertising up until 1937, when it began radio advertising very effectively with leading radio per-
                                   sonality Jack Davey. It was not until 1957 that the firm opened its first dedicated food store in
                                   Sydney’s Dee Why.
                                        In 1960, Woolworths became Australia’s first nationwide retailer after acquiring Centralian
                                   Traders in Alice Springs. With this acquisition, the company finally achieved its mission of cater-

                                        The company’s chain of discount stores, named BIG W, opened in 1976 in Tamworth, New
                                   South Wales. By the end of 1978, the company was operating 13 BIG W discount stores across
                                   five states.
                                        The 1980s were a decade of expansion, including the acquisition of Dick Smith and America
                                   Safeway; by 1985, Woolworths had acquired all 126 of Safeway’s Australian stores.
                                        In 2005, Woolworths acquired Foodland Australia Limited’s (FAL’s) entire New Zealand su-
                                   permarket business as well as their 22 Action stores in Australia. In 2009, Woolworths formed a
                                   joint venture with U.S.-based home improvement retailer Lowe’s and also acquired the Danks
                                   Group of hardware businesses in Australia. In 2011, Woolworths opened its first Masters Home
                                   Improvement stores.

               Internal Issues
               Organizational Structure
               It appears that Woolworths is organized using a decentralized chain-of-command, but the divi-
               sional head person’s responsibilities are not clearly defined. For example, there appears to be no
               head person for the BIG W or for Countdown or even for Insurance or Financial Services. Thus,
               there is substantial room for improvement in the overall design of the company’s structure for
               reporting relationships, although the centralized (functional) head person titles and responsibili-
               ties are clear. Allocation of resources across divisions or segments is arguably the most important
               strategy decision that firms make annually, so it is vital for the division head-person’s titles and
               responsibilities to be clear to all insiders and outsiders.
                    The term “organizational structure” refers to how a firm’s operations are grouped or arranged
               for battle against rival firms. Structure is vital for success in any firm. An organizational chart re-
               veals the chain of command, showing who reports to whom and who is responsible for what prod-
               ucts, regions, and activities. Neither Woolworths’ corporate website nor its 2020 Annual Report
               provides an organizational chart or any indication of top executive reporting relationships. In fact,
               beyond a mere list of management executives with titles, no one is sure whether this company tends
               to operate by-region or by-product in overall accountability and responsibility of top executives.
                    Especially because it is such a large firm, Woolworths’ basic organizational structure needs
               both clarification and enhancement to improve effectiveness and efficiency. Among the basic types
               of structure—such as functional, divisional, and matrix—a strategic business unit (SBU) struc-
               ture is based on grouping similar divisions together within groups. Some analysts contend that
               Woolworths should be utilizing an SBU structure because this type of design is especially useful
               when the number, size, and geographic dispersion of segments, divisions, or profit centers in a
               firm is roughly greater than 10 (depending on the size and geographic dispersion of the segments).
               Transitioning to an SBU-type structure could facilitate strategy implementation by improving co-
               ordination between similar divisions and channeling accountability to distinct business units.

               ing relationships. As there is no chief operating officer, it appears that all top executives report

    536    STRATEGIC-MANAGEMENT CASE ANALYSIS

                                   directly to the CEO. Many analysts suggest a need for Woolworths to reorganize based on cur-
                                   rent organizational structure concepts and practice. Transforming into an SBU-type structure
                                   based on products likely would be best for the company. Under this arrangement, regional presi-
                                   dents would likely be below all product-based unit managers.

                                   Financial Data and Statements
                                   Exhibit 2 shows recent income statements for Woolworth. Note that revenues increased 6 per-
                                   cent, but there was a 56 percent decrease in net income, due mostly to the AU$1.2 billion in
                                   non-recurring events in 2019, when Woolworths sold its petrol business; the AU$1.2 billion was
                                   after-tax profit from this sale. Note that interest expense increased as well, but this is a result of
                                   a new accounting policy in Australia described in detail in the discussion of the balance sheet.
                                   Since net income and earnings before tax include both the new accounting rule and the one-
                                   time sale of the petroleum business, the EBIT number may be the better number for accessing
                                   profitability in 2020. With a 12 percent increase, it appears that Woolworths overall had a good
                                   year in 2020.

                                   vided by Woolworths in their Annual Report, the firm combines goodwill with intangibles, but
                                   when reading the notes to the balance sheet, the precise goodwill number can be found; keep this
                                   in mind when doing your research. Treasury stock is referred to as contributed equity on the bal-
                                   ance sheet for Woolworths.
                                       The major change to the balance sheet from 2019 to 2020 resulted from the passing of a new
                                   law by the Australia Accounting Standards Board (AASB) whereby firms must now place leases
                                   that are of significant financial weight on their balance sheet (this was not required previously).
                                   Note that Woolworths’ long-term assets increased 804 percent and long-term debt increased by
                                   the same dollar amount to reflect this accounting change. While this change may not have any
                                   impact on your recommendations moving forward for Woolworths, it is important to understand
                                   what the numbers on the balance sheet represent.

                                   Strategy
                                   Woolworths is currently revamping their food offerings to provide customers with a more var-
                                   ied selection of healthy and fresh meals. In fiscal 2020, 131 new Fresh Made Easy products
                                   were offered to customers. In addition, 54 Woolworths stores provided an extra store section for
                                   ethnic foods, providing customers with increased variety in their selection process. A new app
                                   was offered in 2020 and was downloaded over a million times just a few months after launch.

               The app allows customers to order food online and monitor order tracking; it also makes per-
               sonalized offers to customers. Group online sales totaled AU$3.5 billion in 2020, up 42 percent
               from 2019. About 5.5 percent of total sales in 2020 were derived from online purchases.
                   It appears that the firm likes to renew the key drivers of growth every year. For 2021, the
               six key drivers of growth are: 1) keeping the business Covid-safe, 2) expanding food options to
               customers, 3) separating the Endeavor Group, 4) building adjacencies, 5) advancing e-commerce
               options, and 6) working more closely with all stakeholders. While these drivers are important,
               most are not strategic in nature, except possibly for the separation of the Endeavour Group,
               which trades on the Australian Stock Exchange as a separate firm from Woolworths as of July
               2021. An additional strategy the firm is undertaking is building smaller stores closer to customers
               rather than having fewer mega-sized stores.

               Woolworths’ Segments
               Woolworths performs operations within four business segments: 1) Australian Food, 2) New
               Zealand Food, 3) BIG W, and 4) Endeavour Group (Drinks and Hotels).

    538    STRATEGIC-MANAGEMENT CASE ANALYSIS

                                   Australian Food
                                   Within Woolworths’ Australian Food segment is Woolworths Supermarkets, Metro Food Stores,
                                   and WooliesX. Sales for Australian Food were up 8.3 percent for 2020, making this segment the
                                   fastest growing and largest, with revenues in excess of AU$42 billion. Metro Food Stores con-
                                   tributed only AU$943 million in sales in 2020, but that number did increase 5 percent from the
                                   previous year. There was a trend during 2020 of customers shopping more locally at smaller stores.
                                   Additionally, the average basket price increased 5.8 percent, but the total number of transactions
                                   declined 1.8 percent. These numbers reflect customers making fewer trips to the grocery store but
                                   purchasing more while there. It can also be inferred from these numbers that customers were eating
                                   out less in 2020, enabling this segment’s 8.3 percent revenue growth for the fiscal year.
                                   Woolworths Supermarkets: The company owns and operates 995 supermarket stores as well as
                                   distribution centers and support offices across Australia. The company is proud of the fact that it
                                   obtains 96 percent of all its fresh fruit and vegetables and 100 percent of all its fresh meat from
                                   Australian farmers and growers, making the company “Australia’s Fresh Food People.”
                                   WooliesX: This is the company’s online operations, reorganized in 2020 into three platforms:
                                   Digital & Medical, eCom & Fulfilment, and Loyalty & FinTech. Digital & Medical include gen-
                                   erating demand and cartology; eCom & Fulfilment include home delivery and pick-up. Loyalty
                                   & FinTech covers Everyday Rewards, gift cards, and insurance for cars, pets, homes, furniture,
                                   roadside assistance, landlords, renter contents, and travel, in addition to life insurance. Grocery
                                   shoppers get a 10 percent discount if the customer has an insurance policy. Additionally, the
                                   company has its own Visa credit cards and sells gift cards.

                                   New Zealand Food
                                   This segment of Woolworths consists of Countdown, a chain of 181 supermarkets located all
                                   across New Zealand, as well as 4 dry grocery distribution centers, 3 fresh produce distribu-
                                   tion centers, 2 meat-processing plants, 1 seafood-processing plant, and support offices. Online
                                   sales in this segment grew 44.5 percent in 2020, anchored by a 74.8 percent increase in Q4. The
                                   company’s New Zealand Food’s franchise stores (FreshChoice and SuperValue) added online
                                   capability to 58 stores in 2020. In 2020, CountDown opened an 8,800-square-meter eStore in
                                   Penrose, an industrial suburb in Auckland where 200 employees complete online orders for cus-
                                   tomers at 10 of CountDown’s busiest Auckland supermarkets.

                                   Big W
                                   BIG W is a chain of 183 stores located across Australia, Hong Kong, and Bangladesh. The stores
                                   offer a variety of products similar to a small Walmart, providing discounted prices on quality
                                   products. BIG W is doing great, with 2020 revenues up 11.2 percent over the prior year and Q4
                                   of 2020 showing revenues up 30.5 percent. In the same quarter, BIG W’s online sales were up
                                   181 percent as people transition to online business both regionally and globally.

                                   Endeavour Group—Endeavor Drinks
                                   This segment of Woolworths includes EndeavourX, which is the company’s investment in digital
                                   and online efforts to spur sales. Online sales in this segment grew 28.6 percent in 2020 while
                                   growth in door-to-door deliveries grew 161 percent. In this segment, during 2020, over 1,500
                                   plexiglass screens and sanitation stations were installed at 1,500 Dan Murphy and BWS liquor
                                   stores. Among alcoholic beverages, Australian-made gin is the fastest growing category of spir-
                                   its, but craft and premium beer remain popular among Australians. Among wines, premium and
                                   super-premium brands sold well at the Dan Murphy’s liquor stores throughout 2020.

                                   Endeavor Group—Hotels
                                   Australian government–mandated closures of hotels in 2020 due to COVID-19 devasted this seg-
                                   ment. In mid-2020, 80 Endeavor hotels and 5 managed clubs remained closed in Victoria.

                                   Segment Performance
                                   Exhibits 4 and 5 provide a segment-based breakdown of sales. Note that Australia Food is the
                                   main driver of the company and should probably be the main attention of your analysis. What
                                   should be done with the other segments is important, though. Recall that the firm plans to spin
                                   off the Endeavor Drink business, so bear this in mind when researching the case.

               Australian Business Considerations
               Australians take great pride in purchasing products that are labeled “Made in Australia” or
               “Grown in Australia,” and as a result, imported products need attractive marketing of their
               unique attributes to compete with domestic products. Australians in general value quality over
               quantity, so portion sizes are not that important, which presents an excellent opportunity for gro-
               cery stores to promote their store brands: cut back on the portion size, market the unique healthy
               aspects of the product, and charge a similar price, resulting in a higher margin. There remains a
               large demand in Australia for organic and ethnic foods. One major opportunity or threat facing
               grocery stores is Australia is the country’s free trade negotiations with the European Union and
               the United Kingdom. Once finalized, Australian customers can expect a significant upgrade in
               quality of food and options on food.

                                   Private Label
                                   Private label products are growing in popularity in Australia, with Aldi leading the way.
                                   Australians have traditionally not trusted private labels as much as their brand-name counter-
                                   parts, but this is changing, and no-name brands are expected to grow significantly. These store
                                   brands tend to be of similar quality and have much higher margins, benefiting grocery stores.
                                   Generally, a store can make more on, for example, a store cola than on a Pepsi or Coke since the
                                   major brand has spent millions on advertising. Woolworths and Coles, for example, are including
                                   private label brands for up to 40 percent of their store offerings. One of the more common areas
                                   for private label brands is in prepared foods and meats. Interestingly, when most people think of
                                   store brands, they think of soda, chips, or similar items, but gourmet foods and expensive deli
                                   meats, once price-prohibitive, are now consumed much more often and have become extremely
                                   popular no-name brand options.

                                   A Better Shopping Experience
                                   The COVID-19 pandemic accelerated the online shopping experience, and most industry ex-
                                   perts agree it is here to stay. Coles and Woolworths have reported that their online sales grew
                                   in excess of 30 percent in 2020. Supply-chain optimization, excellent mobile applications, and
                                   other online platforms are needed to maintain the online shopping demand. One interesting
                                   difference between Coles and Woolworths is that the former is much more centralized, with
                                   distribution centers that are heavily automated and a partnership with British online supermar-
                                   ket Ocado, while the latter mostly avoids having to depend on a partner like Ocado; instead of
                                   a few jumbo centralized centers, it utilizes many micro-fulfillment centers. Metcash also has
                                   entered the online sector of the grocery industry with IGA Shop Online, but the firm remains a
                                   significantly smaller player than Coles and Woolworths in the online arena.
                                       Coles and Woolworths are improving the shopping experience by refurbishing their existing
                                   stores, increasing online options, and gravitating to more market-style formats. Both companies
                                   have learned that a market-style fresh-food section is extremely popular with customers. In addi-
                                   tion, both companies are focusing on expanding through smaller stores in more locations rather
                                   than huge central location stores. With this new strategy, both Coles and Woolworths are compet-
                                   ing with IGA’s and Foodland’s niche.

                                   Healthier Eating
                                   The global trend toward more healthy eating is true in Australia too. Traditional snacks such as
                                   cookies and candy are set to grow modestly, but sports nutrition, packaged foods and healthy on-
                                   the-go snacks are booming. Keep in mind that many products marketed as healthy may not be the
                                   healthiest choices. For example, sports nutrition bars, granola bars, and cereals may be loaded
                                   in sugar and processed ingredients. Nevertheless, the trends favor these products over traditional
                                   candy bars and cookies.
                                       More and more customers are choosing to incorporate meat-free days in their diets. The
                                   plant-based diet is extremely popular in many parts of the world and is expanding into Australia
                                   as well. Demand for fish, seafood, and lean chicken is expected to grow more rapidly than other
                                   meat options. Products with natural sweeteners are also seeing a large growth rate as more cus-
                                   tomers avoid sugar-based and artificial sweeteners. People are also consuming less alcohol in
                                   Australia, creating a boom for zero- or low-alcohol beverages. Recall that store brands, as op-
                                   posed to global brands, are increasing in popularity and generally have a higher margin, provid-
                                   ing many creative options for new store brand product creations.

                                   Australia Grocery Shopping Habits
                                   The annual grocery market in Australia is over AU$120 billion, with the average home spend-
                                   ing AU$160 weekly on groceries. Men reportedly spend about 10 percent more than women
                                   on average. Woolworths and Coles dominate the market, with a combined 65 percent market
                                   share. Woolworths is the largest grocery store in Australia, with 37 percent market share and
                                   nearly half of Australians shopping at the stores. Women tend to prefer Woolworths, with 10
                                   percent more women shopping there than men, while men prefer Aldi or Metcash (also called
                                   IGA). Gen Z shoppers are Woolworths’ most loyal customer by age, with 54 percent shopping
                                   at the stores.

                   About 75 percent of Australians shop for groceries at least once a week, and 80 percent
               of them are a member of a grocery store points program, the two largest of these being Coles’
               Flybuys and Woolworths’ Everyday Rewards. Good news for grocery stores is that 62 percent of
               customers use their points to get cash back off groceries (7 percent reported they do not use their
               points for anything). Having an established reward system is likely important in Australia as a
               recent consumer sentiment survey listed the price of groceries as the third most stressful expense
               for Aussies, only trailing rents and mortgages and energy expenses for stress levels.
                   Exhibit 6 reveals the percent revenue breakdown of grocery stores in Australia. Note that
               Dry and Packaged Foods generate the most revenue, and Beverages generates the least. Keep
               in mind, though, that revenue and profit margins are not the same; note the high revenue that
               tobacco generated in the year 2021.

               Competitors
               Based on data from Statista in 2021, New South Wales, Victoria, and Queensland are home to
               2,790, 2,672, and 1,602 grocery stores, respectively, or about 80 percent of all grocery stores
               in Australia. Although Coles is Woolworths’ major rival, in South Australia and Queensland,
               Drakes is a large supermarket and another contender. Harris Farm Markets is a major regional
               player in New South Wales and Queensland. In addition to Metcash and Aldi, there are many
               smaller, local grocery store chains in Australia that compete by trying to provide exceptional
               customer service for local patrons.
                   While Aldi only represents 11 percent of the grocery store market in Australia, it is growing
               and offering strong competition, mainly through lower prices but also from the unique goods it
               offers. Aldi appears to have finished its expansion, considering it has reached the saturation point
               of new stores, and is now attempting to attract new customers to the same stores, keeping exist-
               ing customers, and focusing on higher profit margin items.
                   Grocery store companies always risk placing too much downward pressure on prices.
               However, between 2019 and 2020, Coles increased prices 2.4 percent while Woolworths
               charged 1.4 percent more. Exhibit 7 provides a breakdown of the market share in Australia.
               The good news for grocery stores in Australia is that solid growth is expected through 2026,
               and no major competitors appear ready to enter the market with the possible exception of
               AmazonFresh. This came as a surprise as major German Grocer Kaufland was investing heav-
               ily in real estate in Australia before deciding to forgo its plans and exit the market in 2020.
               This unexpected development makes Costco the last major retailer to enter the market, which
               it did over a decade ago, in 2009. It is interesting that both Coles and Woolworths are today
               shifting from competing on price to competing by offering more products that have a higher
               profit margin. Moreover, firms are expanding their loyalty programs and promotions rather
               than providing discounts.

                                   Conclusion
                                   Strategy Considerations
                                   Woolworths competes in a challenging, low profit-margin business in both Australia and New
                                   Zealand. However, as the old adage goes, “everyone has to eat,” and this fact protects grocery firms
                                   from major downturns in the economy. During rough times, grocery store firms can even experience
                                   an increase in revenues, as Woolworths did in 2020 despite divesting its petroleum business in 2019.
                                       Profit margins are generally low in the grocery business and inventory turnover attention is espe-
                                   cially important. To prosper in this business, it takes exceptional customer service, low prices, varied
                                   product offerings, excellent inventory management, and a well-developed strategic plan. Regarding
                                   the latter, Woolworths must be effective in allocating resources across its segments, particularly in
                                   determining how best to grow its BIG W and New Zealand Foods segments into stronger divisions.
                                       CEO Banducci is shifting Woolworths’ strategy to building more and smaller grocery stores
                                   in more local markets, competing more heavily with Aldi and the myriad other players in these
                                   markets. Perform a comprehensive strategic analysis to determine whether this is a good strat-
                                   egy. Would the future of Woolworths be brighter if it made plans to double its BIG W and New
                                   Zealand operations in 3 years? Be mindful that no firm can do everything that could benefit it;
                                   there is simply not sufficient capital. So tough choices must be made, and that is why strategic
                                   planning is so important.
                                       What would you suggest to CEO Banducci with respect to promotions and rewards versus
                                   flat out promoting the traditional discounts to get people into the store? What mix of products
                                   would you recommend the CEO shift to? How aggressively should firms in the industry switch to
                                   store-brand products over brand-name products? Recall that Exhibit 6 provided data on the most
                                   popular grocery items in Australian grocery stores.
                                       With respect to their Hotel and Endeavor Drinks businesses, should Woolworths divest these
                                   divisions and deploy those funds into other regions or products? As you can see, there are many
                                   strategic considerations for the company regarding how to allocate resources to best satisfy
                                   Woolworths’ shareholders and other stakeholders.
                                       After reading and studying this case and doing your own research regarding the latest trends
                                   in Australia and New Zealand, prepare a strategic plan for the CEO that includes your recom-
                                   mendations for the firm. Be sure not to simply report what the firm is doing or what you think
                                   they are going to do based on the news, unless of course you also feel this is the best option based
                                   on your analyses. Rather, imagine that CEO Banducci and the Woolworths board are paying you
                                   a large fee to develop an exemplary three-year strategic plan for the firm. What should be done
                                   with the WooliesX operations and the company’s hardware stores and hotels? Can Woolworths
                                   remain this diversified and stay successful going forward?
                                       You may need to develop a new vision and mission for Woolworths if your strategy rec-
                                   ommendations are significantly different from what the firm is currently doing in terms of the
                                   products, services, or regions. A new and improved organizational structure is needed to more
                                   clearly identify the accountability and responsibility of top executives, especially in light of your
                                   recommendations for the future.

               www.microsoft.com, MSFT
               Headquartered in Redmond, Washington, Microsoft is the world’s largest software company
               developing products for customers in over 190 countries. The company’s products include
               Windows Office, Windows 8 operating system for personal computers (PC)s, Windows,
               Windows Server operating systems, Windows Azure, Microsoft SQL, Visual Studio, Silverlight,
               and the popular Xbox gaming and entertainment console. Many PC makers such as Acer,
               Lenovo, Dell, Hewlett-Packard, and Toshiba pre-install Microsoft software on devices. The firm
               also offers consulting services, cloud-based services and training certifications as well as online
               products such as Bing, MSN, adCenter, and Atlas. Microsoft has strategic alliances with Nokia,
               NIIT, and Dominion Enterprises. The company owns Skype, LinkedIn, and offers the popular
               Surface tablet computer.
                   In May 2018, Microsoft announced its offering of AI for Accessibility, a new $25 million,
               five-year program aimed at harnessing the power of AI to amplify human capabilities for more
               than 1 billion people around the world with disabilities. This program aims to capitalize on smart
               devices proliferating in homes and businesses across the globe. Smart devices are today power-
               ing advanced ways to see, listen, reason, and predict, without constant connectivity to the cloud.
               That is the intelligent edge as Microsoft refers to the movement.

               History
               Founded by Bill Gates and Paul Allen in 1975, Microsoft was established to develop and sell
               BASIC Interpreters for the Altair 8800. The company rose to dominate the personal computer
               operating system market in the mid-1980s with their MS-DOS software, followed by the
               Microsoft Windows operating system, which was a graphical extension of MS-DOS. Microsoft
               went public in 1986, instantly creating three billionaires and 12,000 millionaires from Microsoft
               employees. In 1990, Microsoft introduced its software office suite, Microsoft Office, that bun-
               dled MS Word and MS Excel together.
                    Microsoft acquired Skype Technologies for $8.6 billion in 2011 in its largest ever acquisi-
               tion. Following the release of Windows Phone 7, Microsoft underwent a gradual rebranding of
               its product range throughout 2011 and 2012. Its logos, products, services, and websites adopted
               the principles and concepts of the Metro design language. Microsoft, in early 2012, introduced
               Windows 8, an operating system designed to power both personal computers and tablet comput-
               ers. Then, in May 2012, introduced its own tablet computer, called the Microsoft Surface. As
               the company continued to diversify away from operating systems, it paid $1.2 billion to buy the
               social network firm Yammer, and then launched its Windows Phone 8. To cope with the potential
               increase in demand for products and services, Microsoft is slowly but surely opening its own
               Microsoft Stores across the United States. Bill and Melinda Gates are today one of the richest
               couples on the planet, and one of the most giving couples in terms of philanthropy endeavors
               through the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.
                    In May 2018, DJI, the world’s leader in civilian drones and aerial imaging technology, and
               Microsoft began a strategic partnership to bring advanced artificial intelligence (AI) and machine
               learning capabilities to DJI drones. The two companies want to help businesses harness the
               power of commercial drone technology and edge cloud computing. This partnership entails DJI
               releasing its software development kit (SDK) for Windows to extend the power of commercial
               drone technology. Additionally, DJI selected Microsoft Azure as its preferred cloud-computing
               partner, taking advantage of Azure’s industry-leading AI and machine learning capabilities. The
               two firms desire to turn vast quantities of aerial imagery and video data into actionable insights
               for thousands of businesses across the globe.

                                            Vision/Mission
                                            On its website, Microsoft describes what could be taken as its vision statement: to empower people
                                            and businesses globally to attain greater success. The company uses the terms vision and mission
                                            interchangeably. Yet, later in the Form 10K when discussing the company’s cloud computing opera-
                                            tions it says (paraphrased): “Our vision is to develop and provide best-in-class platforms and services
                                            for an intelligent cloud infused with artificial intelligence.”

                                            Internal Issues
                                            Organizational Structure
                                            Microsoft’s website reveals that the company operates using a strategic business unit (SBU)
                                            type of organizational structure, with three SBUs and various divisions reporting to those Unit
                                            Head Persons. However, as indicated in Exhibit 1, the titles of Microsoft executives do not
                                            align well with those segments. Probably no one but Microsoft insiders know exactly who
                                            reports to who—but what is important for students is to devise a recommended reporting re-
                                            lationship, perhaps deleting some positions and creating others, to more clearly reveal for all
                                            insiders and outsiders the chain of command.

                                            In 2017, Microsoft spent $13 billion on research and development, a 9 percent increase over the
                                            previous year. The company develops most of their products and services internally using various

               Segments
               Microsoft operates under three segments: 1) Productivity and Business Processes, 2) Intelligent
               Cloud, and 3) More Personal Computing. Microsoft has become the second largest (­behind
               Amazon.com) company for businesses renting computing power and storage via cloud
               ­computing. For Q2 2018 that ended December 31, 2017, revenues at the company’s two biggest
                cloud-computing businesses, Azure infrastructure services and Office 365 online-productivity,
                grew 98 and 41 percent, respectively, following up on the previous quarters 90 and 42 percent
                gains. Revenues in Q2 2018 for the company’s Intelligent Cloud segment, which includes Azure,
                rose 15 percent to $7.8 billion, while revenues at the company’s Productivity and Business
                Processes segment, which includes Office, gained 25 percent to $8.95 billion.

               Productivity and Business Processes
               This segment includes the following four divisions:
               1. Office Commercial—includes Office 365 subscriptions and Office licensed on-premises,
                  comprising Office, Exchange, SharePoint, Skype for Business, and Microsoft Teams, and
                  related Client Access Licenses (“CALs”).
               2. Office Consumer—includes Office 365 subscriptions and Office licensed on-premises, and
                  Office Consumer Services, including Skype, Outlook.com, and OneDrive.
               3. LinkedIn—includes Talent Solutions, Marketing Solutions, and Premium Subscriptions.
               4. Dynamics Business Solutions—includes Dynamics ERP on-premises, Dynamics CRM
                  ­on-premises, and Dynamics 365, a set of cloud-based applications across ERP and CRM.

               Intelligent Cloud
               This segment includes the following two divisions:
               1. Server products and cloud services—includes Microsoft SQL Server, Windows Server,
                  Visual Studio, System Center, and related CALs, and Azure.
               2. Enterprise Services—includes Premier Support Services and Microsoft Consulting
                  Services.

               More Personal Computing
               This segment includes the following three divisions:
               1. Windows—includes Windows equipment, operating system, cloud services, patent licens-
                  ing, Windows Internet of Things (“IoT”); and MSN display advertising.
               2. Devices—includes Microsoft Surface, PC accessories, and other devices.
               3. Gaming—includes Xbox hardware and Xbox software and services.
               Exhibit 2 provides a revenue and profit breakdown of Microsoft’s three segments for 2017,
               2016, and 2015. Note that the company’s “More Personal Computing” segment generates the
               most revenue and operating income, but also is the only segment reporting declining revenues
               for three years.

                                   Finance
                                   Microsoft is a very transparent company in that their website provides full segment revenue and
                                   operating profit information, and the firm’s Form 10K is provided on the corporate website as
                                   a .docx file which is unusual. The company’s recent income statements and balance sheets are
                                   provided in Exhibit 3 and Exhibit 4 respectively. The company’s fiscal year ends June 30.
                                       Microsoft’s revenues for Q2 2018 increased 12 percent to $28.92 billion, but profits were
                                   negative $6.3 billion. The prior quarter reported an overall profit of positive $6.27 billion.
                                   Microsoft’s CFO Amy Hood said in February 2018 that she has no plans yet to bring back to the
                                   United States the company’s $142.8 billion in cash in overseas accounts.

                                   Competition
                                   Being so diversified, Microsoft has different competitors in different segments. The company’s
                                   Windows Operating System faces competition from Apple and Google who have their own op-
                                   erating systems. Microsoft’s server products face stiff competition from Hewlett-Packard, IBM,
                                   and Oracle, who all offer preinstalled operating systems on their server hardware. Microsoft’s
                                   cloud-based services compete with Amazon, Google, and Salesforce.com, while Microsoft’s
                                   SQL Azure faces intense competition from IBM, Oracle, and many other firms.
                                       The Microsoft Office package (Word, Excel, Access and other products) faces heavy com-

                                   tors offering word processing, spreadsheets, and databases. The company’s Entertainment and
                                   Devices segment, producer of Xbox360, faces intense competition from heavyweights Nintendo
                                   and Sony. The average life of an entertainment console is surprisingly long at more than 5 years
                                   and game selection is one of the largest factors in deterring the success of a gaming console.
                                       Microsoft’s new Windows smartphone competes with market share leader Apple with their
                                   iPhone, and Google with their Android platform powering Samsung, among other phones. Also,
                                   Research in Motion is revitalizing their once popular Blackberry. Microsoft’s alliance with
                                   Nokia to power Nokia phones with Windows 8 hopes to inch away at market share in the phone
                                   industry.
                                       Exhibit 5 provides a financial comparison of Microsoft’s with three competitors. Note that
                                   Microsoft has the lowest EPS among the firms included, partly due to having by far the most
                                   shares of stock outstanding.

               share for all mobile phones, but Samsung is the world leader in smartphone unit volume (most
               phones sold) because they produce multiple options for customers, rather then a one-size-fits-

                                   Cloud computing, supplying computing services via the Internet without having to utilize
                                   ­hardware or platform support, continues to grow in its use and offerings. Many businesses
                                    ­employ the technology to save on costs as they can lease data storage and computing capacity
                                     from Web-based providers. Advantages for businesses using cloud technology include reduced
                                     capital investments in equipment and software, while allowing for payments only for the ca-
                                     pacity needed. Traditionally, firms would buy their own in-house capacity and have to forecast
                                     future needs, often resulting in purchasing more capacity than was needed. Google is the lead
                                     company using cloud technology to support many of their offerings. However, there is still some
                                     concern among businesses that cloud computing offers less security and increased dependability
                                     upon a third-party vender, such as Google, to continually provide the service at an appropriate
                                     network speed is questionable. Nevertheless, cloud services are expected to yield revenues of
                                     $100 billion in 2016, up from $40 billion in 2011.
                                          Broadly speaking, there are hundreds of external opportunities and threats that impact
                                     Microsoft related to cybersecurity, intellectual property rights, anti-trust litigation, patent
                                     ­infringement, privacy issues regarding the collection and use of personal information, laws
                                      and regulation variation across countries, tax issues, rapid technological advancements across
                                      their diversified product line, artificial intelligence, quantum computing, robotics, and changes
                                      in levels of disposable income across countries. These issues are complicated by the fact that
                                      Microsoft has such different competitors across its three basic segments. For example, Facebook
                                      is a huge competitor to LinkedIn, whereas Amazon, Oracle, and Google are huge competitors
                                      in cloud computing. China in particular has firms gaining rapidly in the artificial intelligence,
                                      quantum computing, and robotics industries, so rival firms to Microsoft are not limited to
                                      American businesses.

                                   Future
                                   Microsoft’s plans going forward are to continue making acquisitions and entering into joint ven-
                                   tures and strategic alliances. The company took on substantial goodwill and intangible “dollars”
                                   with its LinkedIn acquisition—and expects to record perhaps a $5 billion impairment charge in
                                   2018 to draw down the high goodwill and intangible amounts shown on its balance sheets. Effort
                                   must be made to acquire firms at market capitialization value or less, not more.
                                        In early 2018, Microsoft formed a partnership with Sunseap Group that marked Microsoft’s
                                   first clean energy deal in Asia and will create the single-largest solar energy portfolio in
                                   Singapore to date. This 60 megawatt-peak (MWp) solar portfolio is to span hundreds of rooftops
                                   across the nation and is the first rooftop solar portfolio in the country focused on serving data-
                                   center energy consumption. Sunseap is a leading solar provider in Singapore. Microsoft began
                                   operations in Singapore in 1990, and now has over 850 employees. Singapore is also home to
                                   Microsoft’s datacenter services that deliver Microsoft Azure, Office 365 and numerous other
                                   cloud services for customers.
                                        Also in early 2018, Xiaomi Corporation and Microsoft signed a Strategic Framework
                                   Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) to deepen the partnership between the two companies.
                                   Founded in 2010, Xiaomi is one of the world’s most innovative technology companies offering

               smartphones, smart TVs, and a range of smart home products. Microsoft’s cloud computing and
               artificial intelligence (AI) technologies will help strengthen Xiaomi’s mobile, smart devices and
               services, and contribute to the acceleration of its international expansion. This partnership also
               allows Microsoft to reach more users around the world who are using Xiaomi products. Xiaomi
               and Microsoft’s cooperation will focus on the following aspects:
               1. Cloud support: The two firms will explore utilizing Microsoft Azure cloud platform to
                  support Xiaomi’s user data storage, bandwidth, computing and other cloud services in inter-
                  national markets.
               2. Laptop-type devices: Xiaomi gains Microsoft support on joint marketing, channel support,
                  and future product development for Xiaomi’s laptop and laptop-type devices to penetrate
                  international markets.
               3. Microsoft Cortana and Mi AI Speaker: Both companies desire to integrate Cortana with
                  Mi AI Speaker.
               4. AI services collaboration: Xiaomi and Microsoft intend to explore multiple cooperative
                  projects based on a broad range of Microsoft AI technologies, such as Computer Vision,
                  Speech, Natural Language Processing, Text Input, Conversational AI, Knowledge Graph
                  and Search, as well as related Microsoft AI products and services, such as Bing, Edge,
                  Cortana, XiaoIce, SwiftKey, Translator, Pix, Cognitive Services, and Skype.
                   Microsoft is looking to form other partnerships similar to the ones with Sunseap Group and
               with Xiaomi to extend Microsoft desires to further penetrate world markets with its unique prod-
               ucts and services. For example, in the summer 2018, Microsoft began working with Qualcomm
               Technologies to create a vision AI developer kit running Azure IoT Edge. This solution makes
               available the key hardware and software required to develop camera-based IoT solutions that
               can power advanced Azure services, such as machine learning, stream analytics, and cognitive
               services.
                   Microsoft needs a clear strategic plan going forward to manage and grow its worldwide
               footprint.

                                   Amazon.com—2018

                                   www.amazon.com, AMZN
                                   Headquartered in Seattle, Washington, the year 2017 was phenomenal for Amazon that over
                                   the last twenty years has grown from being solely an online bookstore to a worldwide pow-
                                   erhouse, selling virtually everything today to everybody. Amazon is the largest online retailer
                                   in the world as measured by both revenue and market capitalization. The second largest
                                   online retailer is Alibaba Group located in China. Led by their CEO, Jeff Bezos, Amazon has
                                   expanded heavily into smart homes and through its Alexa platform, and even into machine
                                   learning. In 2017, the firm shipped over 5 billion items with Prime worldwide with more
                                   paid members joining Prime in 2017 than any previous year, both in North America and
                                   worldwide.
                                       Amazon reported record revenues in 2017, up 31 percent—helped in part by Fire TV Stick
                                   and Echo Dot—that were the bestselling products across all of Amazon’s products sold. Tens
                                   of millions of Echo devices alone were purchased, but a portion of the revenue increase can
                                   be explained through the acquisition of Whole Foods. Amazon hired 130,000 new employees
                                   in 2017, globally, and employs over 17,500 veterans and their spouses in the United States. In
                                   2017, Amazon Prime Video reported over 18 million views from customers in 11 NFL games
                                   across over 200 countries on their smart TVs and other devices. Amazon also now holds the
                                   global TV rights to The Lord of the Rings. The company even launched two furniture brands
                                   in 2017.
                                       Amazon reports in three segments: North America, International, and Amazon Web Services
                                   (AWS). Amazon, in early 2018, launched a new service called “Shipping with Amazon” aimed
                                   at competing with FedEx Corporation and United Parcel Services (UPS). But the Amazon’s
                                   40 planes and 300 warehouses pale in comparison, for example, to FedEx’s 650 planes,
                                   150,000 trucks, 400,000 employees, and 4,800 operating facilities globally to handle about
                                   12 million shipments a day. UPS is even larger than FedEx and handles 20 million packages a
                                   day with service to more than 220 countries through a fleet of more than 500 planes and 100,000
                                   vehicles. At least for now, neither FedEx or UPS is concerned that Amazon wants into the ship-

                                   History
                                   Amazon opened for business in July 1995 as an online bookstore and has since grown into the
                                   largest e-commerce firm in the world. The name Amazon was chosen because the Amazon
                                   River region is “exotic and different” and the biggest river system in the world; founder Jeff
                                   Bezos planned to make his bookstore the biggest in the world. Amazon started an associate
                                   program where other websites could post on amazon.com; this led to allowing individuals to
                                   post items for sale. Online shopping became popular with the growth of the Internet in 1995
                                   with the world’s population percentage of using the Internet being 0.4 percent. That was a total
                                   of 16 million people using the Internet in 1995.
                                       After a decade, the world’s population percentage of using the Internet grew to 15.7 percent;
                                   which is a total of 1,018 million people. As of June 2017, the world’s population of using the
                                   Internet was 51.7 percent; which is a total of 3,885 million people. The demand for online shop-
                                   ping also has grown substantially.
                                       Amazon’s number of worldwide customer accounts has grown from 1.5 million customer
                                   accounts in the 1990s to over 500 million in 2018. In 2005, Amazon created the Amazon Prime
                                   membership program where members were eligible for faster 2-day, or even 1-day, shipping on
                                   their orders. The program also allowed members to have access to the Amazon Instant Video

               where members could stream videos. About 60 percent of Amazon users in the U.S. are Amazon
               Prime subscribers.
                     In 2007, Amazon began offering its Kindle 3rd-generation-readers, paving the way for
               ­e-books. Today, you do not even need a kindle to read e-books as the free kindle app is suf-
                ficient. The firm’s establishment of Prime offering free shipping and select audio and video to
                customers for free was a hit with consumers and now Amazon generates more revenues from
                Prime customers than from nonprime customers in the United States.
                     Amazon, in the last few years, is aggressively expanding its Amazon Web Services (AWS)
                business which focuses on machine learning, powering smart homes, and other data driven
                ­applications. Many people are familiar with Amazon’s smart speakers, or Alexa, who is ready to
                 help on many items.
                     In early 2017, Amazon acquired Whole Foods Market for $13.7 billion in at attempt to both
                 move into the brick and mortar business, but possibly as a means of delivering groceries in the
                 future. Whole Foods is a leader in organic foods in North America and has over 477 stores in
                 North America and the United Kingdom.
                     Amazon is locating a second headquarters in a city with at least a million people; the city is
                 to be revealed in mid-2018. The $5 billion second headquarters, starting with 500,000 square
                 feet and eventually expanding to as much as 8 million square feet, may have as many as 50,000
                 employees. The company is also building a new downtown Seattle building, expected to be
                 completed in 2020.


               Organizational Culture
               Amazon
               From his first Annual Report in 1996, CEO Jeff Bezos indicated that Amazon puts customers
               first, and even today, in the 2017 Annual Report, Amazon describes itself as on a mission to be
               the “Earth’s most customer-centric company.” Amazon also has a culture that promotes new
               ­inventions, long-term thinking, and operational excellence (being efficient).
                    Bezos has routinely reminded his employees and executives it is still Day 1 at Amazon, in
                fact, the building Bezos works in is named Day 1 and when they changed buildings, he took
                the name with him for the new building. As it would happen, an employee in 2016 finally
                summoned the courage to ask Bezos what all other employees for the last 20 years were prob-
                ably wondering, when does Day 2 start? In short, Bezos describes Day 2 as “irrelevance, and
                an excruciating painful decline followed by death.” And for this reason, it is always Day 1 at
                Amazon. To remain in Day 1, Bezos suggests to experiment, accept failures as part of busi-
                ness, plant and protect seeds, and maybe most important, ramp it up when you see delighted
                customers.
                    In May 2018, for the third year in a row, customers voted Amazon #1 in corporate
                reputation in the Harris Poll, a poll that surveys more than 25,000 people and evalu-
                ates public perceptions classified into six dimensions of corporate reputation: Workplace
                Environment, Social Responsibility, Emotional Appeal, Financial Performance, Vision &
                Leadership, and Products & Services. At about the same time, a poll of 50,000 U.S. consum-
                ers ranked Amazon #1 in the American Customer Satisfaction Index for the Internet Retail
                category for the eighth year in a row. Additionally, a poll of 10,000 U.K. customers ranked
                Amazon.co.uk #1 in customer satisfaction for the fifth consecutive time as reported by
                the U.K. Customer Satisfaction Index. Amazon recently received other accolades too, such as

               At Whole Foods Market, all employees, managers, and executives know what everyone else’s
               pay is at the company, including hourly wages earned, salaries, and bonuses. Headquartered
               in Austin, Texas, but now owned by Amazon, Whole Foods keeps its employees as informed

                                   encourage conversations about salary among staff members and to promote competition within
                                   the company. Whole Foods co-CEO, John Mackey, introduced the policy in 1986, just 6 years
                                   after he co-founded the company; the policy is part of the company’s culture.
                                           Whole Foods believes that when employees understand why some people are paid more
                                   than others, when workers understood what types of performance and achievement earned
                                   certain people more money, folks are more motivated and successful. John Mackey says: “I’m
                                   ­challenged on salaries all the time. How come you are paying this regional president this much,
                                    and I’m only making this much?’ I have to say, ‘because that person is more valuable. If you
                                    ­accomplish what this person has accomplished, I’ll pay you that, too.’ ”
                                           Whole Foods’ policy is for all its managers to post their store’s sales data each day
                                     and regional sales data each week. The company believes that a culture of shared informa-
                                     tion helps create a sense of a “shared fate” among employees. Mackey says: “If you’re
                                     ­trying to create a high-trust organization, an organization where people are all-for-one and
                                      ­one-for-all, you can’t have secrets.” The bottom line for Whole Foods is that its workforce
                                       has high-level access to the company’s financial data, and therefore a greater stake in the
                                       business, and this culture has resulted in outstanding customer service and a highly moti-
                                       vated workforce.

                                   Amazon’s vision statement (paraphrased) is to be the most customer-oriented company on the
                                   planet, where customers can find virtually anything they wish to purpose online. Amazon’s
                                   ­mission statement (paraphrased) is to offer customers the lowest possible prices, coupled with the
                                    best selection and the upmost convenience. On its website, Amazon lists its guiding principles:
                                    customer-centric culture, innovation, operational excellence, and long-term strategy.

                                   Organizational Structure
                                   Jeff Bezos is President, CEO, and Chairman of the Board of Amazon. The company apparently
                                   has two divisions: Amazon Web Services and Worldwide Consumer, but it is not clear what
                                   these divisions entail. The company’s top executives are listed in Exhibit 1 along with a possible
                                   organizational chart. Amazon does not make its organizational chart public so no one, except
                                   insiders, know who reports to whom.

               Current Strategies
               There are four key points used to develop Amazon’s strategy: 1) have an obsession with
               your customers, 2) resist proxies, 3) embrace external trends, and 4) make rapid decisions.
               Bezos says being truly customer focused is a better approach than focusing on competitors,
               products, technology, or even your business model. Surprisingly, Bezos’ take on why being
               customer focused is the most important is a bit of a negative reason. He contends that custom-
               ers are often dissatisfied, and sometimes significantly dissatisfied, yet will still report being
               happy all while your business is prospering. What Bezos is getting at here is the same line of
               logic Apple’s Steve Jobs mentioned countless times, customers don’t know what they want,
               therefore by default become dissatisfied with your products when a better option b­ ecomes
               available.
                   Bezos mentions the Prime membership program as one example where customers never
               knew they would want or desire such a platform, yet now millions use and love Prime. Steve
               Jobs often mentioned virtually no customer knew they would want or need a personal computer,
               yet the Apple II was a huge hit in the early 1980s, and the development of the smartphone in
               2006 was the same concept.
                   Avoiding proxies is another trait Bezos believes is important to remaining in Day 1. By
               proxy he means using one tool as a substitute for another (generally, the most important). He
               uses having a formal process as proxy instead of serving customers first. Really, since Bezos
               puts extreme emphasis on serving customers, any area that receives focus in lieu of customers
               can be considered a proxy. Areas to avoid with having a detailed process are letting the process
               become king and following it to a tee instead of routinely examining business outcomes. Bezos
               also cites beta testing and surveys as proxies but they, like having a formal process, should not
               be a replacement for heart, intuition, guts, and other variables, yet he still contends it is impor-
               tant to have a process.
                   Embracing external trends is also vitally important to avoiding Day 2. Currently, machine
               learning and data analytics are two huge external trends and Amazon is well positioned with its
               AWS Division.
                   Finally, being able to make rapid decisions is important to avoiding Day 2 according to
               Bezos. The difference in a Day 1 and Day 2 firm, is not based on good or poor decisions, but
               generally when the decisions are made. Day 2 firms make the decision too late, after it is clear
               to everyone, thus much of the money or opportunity is gone. Yet decisions should be two-way
               doors, there should be a way out if it becomes apparent a different decision should have been
               made. To act fast, make the decision with 70 percent information; waiting for 90 percent is what
               Day 2 firms do. Learn how to become good at correcting course because here it generally ends
               up far less costly to have a go with 70 percent knowledge and be wrong, than wait for 90 percent
               and miss the market.
                   Amazon is aggressively entering the AWS (Amazon Web Services) environment. The firm’s
               Alexa program far ­exceeded 2017 projections and CEO Jeff Bezos expects the company to
               “double down” on expanding and funding Alexa. As of early 2018, customers are able to control
               with Alexa over 4,000 smart home devices produced by 1,200 different brands.
                   Amazon used an unrelated diversification strategy to launch Rivet and Stone & Beam, two
               new furniture brands with the former focusing on mid-century modern furniture for smaller
               rooms, and the later focusing on durable and stylish furniture for larger areas. Possibly a related
               diversification strategy was the purchase of Whole Foods in 2017.
                   In several market development moves, Amazon started a third-party marketplace in Australia
               offering customers timely delivery products, many from small businesses. Launching Prime in
               the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg, providing Prime members there with free one- or
               two-day delivery and other Prime benefits for the inexpensive introductory price of €3.99 or
               around $5.00. Amazon reported negative EBIT in both 2016 and 2017 with EBIT losses over
               doubling in 2017. The inexpensive Prime membership in overseas markets may explain part of
               the losses; in the United States for comparison, Prime for one month cost $12.99.
                   Students in the United States may subscribe to Prime for generally half the retail cost.
               Prime in Singapore, India, and other locations also come with inexpensive introductory rates.
               Amazon is actively expanding third-party marketplaces around the world, not just in Australia,
               but in Brazil, India, Europe, and many other places. Amazon Prime in both North America and

                                   International markets allows customers to pay a monthly or yearly fee for free shipping. In the
                                   United States, the free shipping is promised with a two-day delivery window. In addition cus-
                                   tomers are provided Prime Music and Video as part of their subscription.
                                       Prime members spend over $700 more than non-Prime members—possibly by getting
                                   customers to sign up as they feel they should order more to justify the $99 annual membership
                                   (U.S. price). Or potentially, customers that order more are the majority of the ones that sign up
                                   for Prime potentially reducing Prime’s effectiveness somewhat. Amazon has angered some cus-
                                   tomers who are not Prime members though by taking 7 to 10 days to ship items ordered in the
                                   United States when free shipping is selected for orders over $50.
                                       Amazon has moved from books to retail products, to music, to online data procession, to
                                   the grocery delivery business, and even to package delivery. It seems just 5 years ago, in the
                                   United States, about the only food you could have delivered in most locations outside of a large
                                   city was pizza. Amazon is changing this by offering grocery delivery. The Whole Foods Market
                                   price paid by Amazon was possibly too high, but as Bezos mentioned earlier, he prides himself
                                   on acting quickly, and thought waiting would be more expensive than simply paying the price.
                                   If Whole Foods studied Bezos tendencies, (which they probably did) they knew this tendency
                                   when entering any negotiating. The Whole Foods acquisition, Amazon moved away from strictly
                                   online into the brick and mortar business. However, with the firm’s Echo, Dot, Plus, and other
                                   technologies used in the smart home, it will make ordering from home and having groceries
                                   delivered easier. It is just speculation at this point, what Amazon’s true intentions are with the
                                   Whole Foods acquisition, but gravitating into grocery delivery is certainly a plausible long-term
                                   rationale from the merger.

                                   Finance
                                   Amazon reported excellent earnings in 2017, up 31 percent from 2016 with net income up 28
                                   percent. It is important to note, however, in Exhibit 2, that EBIT actually decreased due to op-
                                   erating expenses, representing a larger percent of sales in 2017. The company was spared from
                                   a drop in net income due to a 46 percent drop in their tax rate. Also, the Whole Foods Market
                                   acquisitions can explain a portion of the revenue increases and likely explain a large portion
                                   of the additional goodwill in Exhibit 3. Note in Exhibit 3, the large increase in long-term debt.
                                   Amazon does not pay dividends either, but this is not a real surprise as the firm is ready to invest
                                   its capital in other ventures.
                                        For Q1 2018 that ended 3-31-18, Amazon reported that its sales increased 43 percent
                                   to $51.0 billion, compared with $35.7 billion in Q1 2017. The company’s operating income for
                                   Q1 increased 92 percent to $1.9 billion, while net income increased to $1.6 billion compared
                                   with net income of $724 million the previous year Q1.

               Segment Data
               Amazon Studios
               In early 2018, Amazon Studios became partners with Oscar-winning filmmaker Kenneth
               Lonergan to direct and write both film and television projects. Lonergan and Amazon Studios
               worked together in 2017 on the famous Manchester by the Sea film, which won Lonergan an
               Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay and a nomination for Best Director. Manchester
               by the Sea is available now for streaming and download on Prime Video. Lonergan’s upcoming
               projects include Howards End, a four-part limited series starring Hayley Atwell, and the play
               “Lobby Hero” starring Chris Evans, Michael Cera, Bel Powley & Brian Tyree Henry, that pre-
               miered on Broadway in 2018 at the Helen Hayes Theater as a Second Stage Production.
                   Amazon Studios produces series and films from top -ier and up-and-coming creators to
               customers in over 200 countries and territories. Original productions include Amy Sherman-
               Palladino’s award-winning The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel. In film, Amazon Studios produces
               and acquires original movies for theatrical release and early window distribution exclusively
               for Amazon Prime members. At the 2017 Academy Awards, Amazon Studios became the first
               streaming service to win Oscars for Best Screenplay, Best Actor, and Best Foreign film. A no-
               table recent release was The Big Sick.
                   Amazon’s Prime Video is a premium on-demand entertainment service that offers customers
               immense choices of movies, films, and television. Amazon channels provide over 140 channel

                                   subscriptions that Prime members can add to their membership, including HBO, Showtime,
                                   STARZ, Cinemax, PBS KIDS, Acorn TV, and more.
                                       Amazon reports in three main segments: Amazon Web Services, North America, and
                                   International—but says very little about its North America and International segments.

                                   Amazon Web Services (AWS)
                                   AWS helps clients with their machine learning processes, removing much of the traditional heavy
                                   lifting or need for many experts to start up such programs. Amazon’s EC2 P3 provides perfor-
                                   mance up to six fold better than existing GPU services available in the cloud as of the start of 2018.
                                        In 2017, Walt Disney named AWS its top choice out of all pubic cloud providers. Symantec,
                                   Expedia, Capital One, National Football League, Dow Jones, FICO, Bristol-Myers Squibb, and
                                   countless others all initiated either a new, or increased, presence with AWS. AWS is not limited to
                                   the U.S. market; France was recently provided service through AWS, and Bahrain, Hong Kong,
                                   Sweden, China, and a second GovCloud Region in the United States are all set to be active by
                                   2019. As revealed in Exhibit 4 and Exhibit 5, AWS revenues grew over 43 percent in 2017, and
                                   EBIT grew 39 percent. Both exceeded growth in Amazon’s t­raditional product offerings in both
                                   North America and International. Also, the profit margins from AWS are significantly higher
                                   than any other division, evidenced by significantly more operating income from this division in
                                   2017 than other divisions, with also astronautically lower sales. Amazon is attempting to expand
                                   AWS across the globe. In fact, on Amazon’s 2017 Q4 report, there was significant discussion on
                                   AWS and hardly any segment discussion on North America or International.

               Competition
               Offering a large variety of products and services both in the United States and abroad puts
               Amazon in competition with all kinds and sizes of firms from all around the world. A sam-
               pling of competitors for Amazon include: similar online sites to purchase goods, traditional
               ­brick-and-mortar stores, firms that provide e-commence services, and firms that provide stream-
                ing content. However, some big-time rivals to Amazon include Walmart, Trader Joe’s, Alibaba,
                Kroger, Target, Alphabet (owner of Google), and e-Bay.
                    One of Amazon’s competitive advantages in the industry is fulfillment since the company
                places great importance on being able to deliver goods quickly to the consumers. In addition,
                price, selection, and convenience are important factors to Amazon’s success. Exhibit 6 provides
                a snapshot comparison of Amazon with two rival firms. Note that Walmart has the highest rev-
                enue but Amazon has the largest market capitalization and cash reserves.
                    As per capita disposable income increased during recent years, many consumers have shifted
                to premium, organic, all natural brands, helping lift industry revenue. Overall, grocery indus-
                try revenue is expected to grow annually by .9 percent to $607.9 billion over the next 5 years.
                Consumers also shifted toward limited assortment and fresh format stores like Trader Joe’s
                that provide a simpler layout and primarily sell less costly store brand products. As consumers
                become more health conscious, measured by the healthy eating index, they tend to purchase
                a greater variety of all-natural and organic products. The healthy eating index is expected to
                slightly increase from year to year.
                    Over the past 5 years, limited assortment grocery stores like Trader Joe’s have experienced
                the most rapid growth in the grocery industry. Trader Joe’s stores are often located in popu-
                lous areas and are much more compact and efficient than traditional grocery stores. Rather
                than ­offering dozens of brands of the same product, these stores sell primarily private label
                products, which are both less expensive for consumers and more profitable for the industry
                operators. Trader Joe’s, the leading supermarket in sales per square foot, sells more than 80
                percent p­ rivate-label goods, all of which are free of GMOs, artificial coloring, trans fat, and
                high fructose corn syrup. While private-label brands are traditionally perceived as inferior,
                stores like Trader Joe’s have positioned their store brands as premium products without charg-
                ing premium prices.
                    Low profit margins and a highly competitive market have discouraged many companies
                from entering the grocery business—but not Amazon. Over the 5 years leading up to 2017, the
                total number of industry enterprises remained flat at about 42,205 companies. In addition to low
                profit margins, the steady rise of online grocery services has further deterred new operators from
                entering the industry. E-commerce sales are expected to rise at an annualized rate of 7.8 ­percent,
                indicating a continued shift toward virtual shopping. Despite the flat, no growth statistics,
                Amazon still “overpaid” for Whole Foods Market.

               Walmart, Inc. (WMT)
               Walmart consists of Sam’s Club, Walmart Supercenter, and the Neighborhood Market. Each
               week, over 260 million customers and members visit Walmart’s 11,695 stores under 59 banners
               in 28 countries and e-commerce websites in 11 countries. Walmart’s revenue was $485.9 billion

                                   for the fiscal year of 2017. Recently, the company implemented free 2-day shipping on more
                                   than two million items, with no membership required.
                                        Walmart has about 17 percent of the market share in the food and beverage industry. In
                                   spring 2017, the number of individuals who bought most of their groceries in their household at
                                   Walmart Supercenters was 45.15 million and 9.31 from Neighborhood Markets from the United
                                   States alone. Walmart plans to increase their market share and revenues with the convenience
                                   and growth of grocery pickup.
                                        When it comes to shipping, Amazon and Walmart are both trying to outdo each other.
                                   Walmart now offers free shipping to anyone ordering $35 in eligible items. Walmart is trying
                                   to win over consumers by offering free 2-day shipping without having to have a membership
                                   like Amazon. Amazon has Amazon Prime where consumers must pay $119 annually to get free
                                   2-day shipping. However, Amazon’s membership also includes having early access to some
                                   deals, unlimited photo storage, include Sunday delivery in many markets, and the company’s
                                   video streaming and music services. Walmart is often called the king of brick-and-mortar retail
                                   and remains to this day the world’s leader in revenues among retail stores. Walmart acquired
                                   jet.com in 2016 and is now offering same-day shipping to New York City. E-commerce rev-
                                   enues in 2017 were only $12 ­billion but Walmart looms as a potential 800-pound gorilla for
                                   Amazon in the online business, and certainly is a major threat and rival to Amazon with their
                                   thousands of free-standing mega stores offering groceries, electronics, toys, clothing, and ev-
                                   erything in between.

                                   Trader Joe’s
                                   Based in Monrovia, California, Trader Joe’s is owned by a German private equity firm. Trader Joe’s
                                   has about 500 stores in 45 states and Washington, D.C. All stores are compact and sell premium
                                   private-label foods that actually comprise 80 percent of all items sold in each store. This allows cus-
                                   tomers to choose between a select number of high-quality products rather than thousands of brand
                                   names. Millennials are the typical customer for Trader Joe’s as they are health conscious and value
                                   driven. About 42 percent of millennial grocery shoppers find private label foods more innovative
                                   than branded products, and about 70 ­percent believe that the quality of these store-brand products
                                   has increased in recent years. Trader Joe’s had 1.1 percent of the market share in 2016; the company
                                   is growing quickly from year-to-year. In spring 2017, the number of individuals in the United States
                                   who bought most of their groceries in their household at Trader Joe’s was 4.27 million. You can
                                   shop at Trader Joe’s through Amazon at the website: https://www.amazon.com/Trader-Joe-s/pages/

                                   Alphabet Inc. (GOOG)
                                   When it comes to the battle of online shoppers, Amazon and Google (owned by Alphabet) are
                                   competitors. Google is in the business of selling ads, whereas Amazon is in the business of
                                   delivering goods, but Google has introduced Google Express. Google Express is a delivery ser-
                                   vice designed to compete with Amazon Prime. However, roughly 33 percent of online shoppers
                                   start directly on Amazon, which is more than twice the number that start on Google. Therefore,
                                   every time someone bypasses Google, Google loses opportunities to show viewer ads. This also
                                   means that more consumers are seeing more advertisements on Amazon than Google.
                                       Google also has their own streaming videos and music services that are competing with
                                   Ama­zon’s streaming videos and music services. Google has Google Play, Google Chromecast,
                                   and their own Google Play Store. Whereas, Amazon has the Kindle Fire Tablet, Amazon’s Fire
                                   TV, and their own app store. These two behemoth companies compete more and more with each
                                   other daily as both firms become more and more diversified with overlapping businesses and
                                   interests.

               StubHub mobile apps and online ticket platform connect fans with their favorite sporting events,
               shows, and artists. eBay’s classifieds platforms include a collection of brands, such as mobile

               fieds to enable people to find almost anything they are looking for in their local communities.

               companies, auctioneers, catalog and mail-order companies, classifieds, directories, search

               Amazon because both companies are gigantic online retail establishments.


               External Issues
               A total of 16 million people used the Internet in 1995. As of June 2017, the world’s popula-
               tion of using the Internet grew to 51.7 percent; which is a total of 3,885 million people. The
               demand for online shopping is skyrocketing, and Amazon is the world’s largest online retailer.
               The e-commerce market in the United States is huge with revenues over $450 billion with
               growth expected through 2023 at 10 percent annually. There are over 135,000 businesses in
               the United States doing business through the Internet, ranging from a person selling custom
               made fishing lures to the king Amazon, which controls over 20 percent of the e-commerce
               market. Possibly surprisingly, the next largest player online is Walmart, yet they only control
               around 3 percent of the market. eBay controls less than 1 percent with Apple controlling ap-
               proximately 2 percent.
                   The most common items Amazon sells are selected for inclusion in Exhibit 7,with the bal-
               ance of items listed as “Other” making up 42 percent of the market. Of this 42 percent, about
               7 percent are derived from both sporting goods and medications, another 10 percent from beauty
               products, and the balance from tools, jewelry, and many other items.
                   The Exhibit 7 categories are so broad, for example, clothing includes footwear and acces-
               sories. As of 2017, 17 percent of clothing industry revenues in the United States were from
               e-commerce. Electronics is also a broad category, including computer hardware, software,
               phones, and even appliances. Like clothing, 17 percent of industry revenues are derived from
               electronics. Media and Entertainment includes books, music, and video, once Amazon’s top
               selling products. Today, industry-wide, media and entertainment only account for 8 percent of
               industry revenues.

                                       While many now may think e-Commerce equals or exceeds brick-and-mortar sales, that is
                                   not the case yet. As of 2017, about 10 percent of retail revenues are attributed to online, and the
                                   number is only expected to grow to 15 percent by 2023, so despite public assumptions, the old-
                                   time brick-and-mortar is hanging around, but customers are increasingly gravitating to o­ nline
                                   options as it is more convenient and delivery times are improving.

                                   Future
                                   In February 2018, Amazon, Chase, and Whole Foods Market announced that the new Amazon
                                   Rewards Visa Card can now be used to earn even more rewards when shopping at Whole Foods
                                   Market on everything from animal welfare-rated meat to sustainably caught wild and responsi-
                                   bly farmed seafood. In particular, with the announcement, benefits to Prime members increased
                                   to 5 percent back on Whole Foods Market purchases when using the Amazon Prime Rewards
                                   Visa Card, and 5 percent back on all Amazon.com purchases, 2 percent back at restaurants, gas
                                   stations, and drugstores, and 1 percent back on all other purchases.
                                       In May 2018, Amazon and Best Buy announced a multi-year, exclusive collaboration to
                                   bring the next generation of Fire TV Edition smart TVs to customers in the U.S. and Canada.
                                   The two companies are jointly launching more than ten 4K and HD Fire TV Edition models
                                   from Toshiba and Insignia brands, available for purchase in 2018 through Best Buy stores,
                                   BestBuy.com, and Amazon.com.
                                       In Q1 2018, Amazon acquired Ring, a home security company. Ring’s mission is to re-
                                   duce crime in neighborhoods with affordable, effective home security products and services.
                                   Also during the Q1 2018, Amazon introduced FreeTime on Alexa, the first Alexa experience
                                   designed just for kids. These new offerings bring Alexa-specific features and premium content
                                   to Amazon’s FreeTime and FreeTime Unlimited services, all available on Echo, Echo Dot, and
                                   Echo Plus devices. Amazon now offers Echo Dot Kids Edition, the simplest way to get started
                                   with FreeTime and FreeTime Unlimited on Alexa.
                                       Amazon has become one of the most diversified companies in the world, selling almost ev-
                                   erything to everybody. Managing diversified operations has increasingly been a bad strategy for
                                   companies. Led by General Electric, diversified companies between 2017 and 2020 were trying
                                   their best to become more homogeneous. How much longer can Amazon successfully buck this
                                   trend? Amazon’s culture, philosophy, or strategy of being willing to enter almost any business, at
                                   any time, is risky, and lucrative when it works out, but potentially devastating long term.
                                       A clear strategic plan for Amazon would be consistent with Bezos’ guiding principle to
                                   ­engage in long-term thinking and planning—and would help safeguard against entering too
                                    many bad ventures.

               Nike, Inc.—2018

               www.nike.com, NKE
               Headquartered in Beaverton, Oregon, Nike is a large sports apparel company providing apparel
               to athletic clubs, universities, fitness-minded people, and many others. Most products are de-
               signed for specific athletic activities, but many people wear the products for casual purposes. In
               addition to apparel and shoes, Nike sells sports bags, eyewear, watches, bats, gloves, and many
               other types of equipment. The firm also owns the Hurley and Converse brands. Nike has always
               been famous for hiring star athletes to market their brands; the company has three athletes,
               Michael Jordan, LeBron James, and Cristiano Ronaldo, signed to life-time endorsement deals.
               Jordan, from 1993 through 2016, was paid over $475 million from Nike even though Jordan re-
               tired from professional sports in 2003.
                   Nike has over 70,000 full-time employees, operates 384 U.S.-based stores and 758 interna-
               tional stores. Nike reported 2017 revenues and net income of about $34 billion and $4 billion,
               respectively, both figures increasing nicely from the prior year. However, for Nike’s second
               quarter (Q2) of fiscal 2018, revenues for the Converse division of Nike were $408 million, down
               4 percent, due to faltering sales in North America. Nike’s net income for Q2 2018 decreased
               9 percent to $767 million. For both Q1 and Q2 of fiscal 2018, the company’s footwear sales
               declined 5 percent and the company’s equipment sales dropped 8 percent in North America.
               Thus, rival companies are eating into Nike’s financial performance in the United States.
               However, outside North America, Nike is doing really well, growing both revenues and net
               income in double digits.
                   For fiscal 2018, Nike’s revenues rose 6 percent to $36.4 billion, up 4 percent. For fiscal 2018,
               NIKE Brand sales to wholesale customers increased 2 percent while NIKE Direct revenues grew
               12 percent to $10.4 billion, due primarily to a 25 percent increase in digital commerce sales, the
               addition of new stores, and 4 percent growth in comparable store sales. For fiscal 2018, Nike’s
               revenues for Converse were $1.9 billion, down 11 percent, as growth in Asia was more than
               offset by declines primarily in North America. For fiscal 2018, the company’s net income de-
               creased 54 percent to $1.9 billion.
                   Nike needs a clear strategic plan going forward, especially to revitalize its businesses in
               North America.

               History
               Bill Bowerman and Phil Knight founded Nike in 1964 as Blue Ribbon Sports and changed
               the name to Nike in 1971. The name comes from the Greek goddess of victory who was
               named Nike. Phil Knight was a University of Oregon track athlete and his coach was Bill
               Bowerman. Nike went public in 1981. Nike originally manufactured shoes in the United
               States but exited the U.S. manufacturing market in 1984. Nike’s trademarks such as “Just Do
               It” and the Swoosh logo are well known worldwide. Phil Knights stepped down as chairman
               of Nike in 2016.
                   Over the years, Nike has acquired many companies, including Cole Haan in 1988, Bauer
               Hockey in 1994, Hurley International in 2002, Converse in 2003, Umbro in 2008—but then
               began divesting companies, including Bauer Hockey in 2008, Umbro in 2012, and Cole Haan in
               2013.
                   Nike still today pays top athletes top dollar in many sports to use, promote, and advertise
               their technology, design, trademarks, logo, and products. Nike’s first professional athlete en-
               dorser was Romanian tennis player Ilie Nastase, soon followed by track star Steve Prefontaine.
               Michael Jordan signed on with Nike in 1984, followed by numerous others such as Spike Lee
               and Mars Blackmon.

                                             Vision/Mission
                                             Nike does not appear to have a formal vision statement. Nike’s mission (paraphrased) is “to
                                             inspire and facilitate every athlete in the world to achieve greatness.”

                                             Organizational Structure
                                             Nike does not make its organizational chart public but likely a division-by-product or division-
                                             by-region type structure would work well since the company reports revenues and operating
                                             profits both by product (footwear, apparel, and equipment) and by region (North America,
                                             Western Europe, China, and Japan). The company’s top executives are listed in Exhibit 1 along
                                             with a possible organizational chart. However, the existing executive titles do not match well
                                             with either of these reportable segment scenarios.

                                             Current Strategies
                                             Nike has built an empire based on product development followed by heavy marketing. Nike
                                             ­offers products in most major sports played worldwide and hires professional athletes to market
                                              their products, even signing Michael Jordan, LeBron James, and Cristiano Ronaldo to lifetime
                                              endorsement contracts. Nike has paid Jordan over $475 million in endorsements and the deals
                                              with James and Ronaldo are valued as much as $1 billion. The $1 billion number may seem
                                              high, but estimates are Ronaldo’s social media presence alone generated $475 million in value
                                              for Nike in 2016. Another study concluded that Ronaldo generates around $175 million for his
                                              sponsors annually, which is seven times what Stephen Curry, the second top-revenue g­ enerating
                                              athlete for sponsors. Based on data in 2016, of the 15 top athlete endorsement deals, Nike
                                              owns 11, with rival Adidas responsible for 3, and Li Nian accounting for one with their relation-
                                              ship with Dwayne Wade. Nike also has deals with many professional teams around the world to
                                              be the sole supplier of their uniforms.
                                                  Nike uses social media heavily, especially with the NikePlus membership, which is free. Nike
                                              offers two applications that include Nike Run Club and Nike Training Club used on ­mobile de-
                                              vices and Apple Watch, whereby users can track their progress through running or cross ­training
                                              programs. Nike has a partnership with Apple where the Nike logo appears on select Apple
                                              watches. Nike benefits by tracking tons of data on workouts from users across the world. In addi-
                                              tion to using the apps for free, customers earn Nike Fuel points whereby they can purchase items
                                              at discounts on Nike’s website and even purchase products not yet available to the public in stores.
                                                  Nike recently introduced the Air Tech Challenge, a strategy whereby the company offers ten-

               new running shoes developed by Nike are Free Flyknit and Free Hyperfeel. The firm also has a
               new pair of self-lacing shoes called the HyperAdapt 1.0.

               Manufacturing
               Nike produces 97 percent of its products through contractors in overseas markets, with Vietnam,
               China, and Indonesia accounting for 44, 29, and 21 percent, respectively. In total, 127 footwear
               factories in 15 different nations supply Nike, with no single factory responsible for more than
               8 percent of total footwear sales. Nike is supplied by over 369 apparel factories in 37 different
               countries, with the largest supplier accounting for 13 percent of revenues. Like shoe production,
               virtually all Nike apparel is manufactured outside the United States with China, Vietnam, and
               Thailand as the three largest suppliers of apparel.
                   With the Trump administration’s incentives to reshore manufacturing back to the United
               States, Nike has announced plans to build additional manufacturing plants in America. Presently,
               the company has 8 manufacturing facilities in the United States, accounting for about 8 percent
               of the company’s total manufacturing output. Nike is very transparent about its manufacturing of
               footwear, apparel, and equipment. Simply click on the website http://manufacturingmap.nikeinc

               Finance
               Nike’s fiscal year ends on June 30. Nike had an excellent fiscal 2017 with revenues up 6 per-
               cent and net income up nearly 13 percent as indicated in Exhibit 2. However, Nike received a
               tax benefit in 2017 or either reduced a tax burden from 2016, helping to partially explain the
               larger jump in net income than in revenues. Nike’s overseas revenues and profits are increas-
               ing nicely, but its North American financial results revealed in the company’s segment data
               are problematic.
                   Exhibit 3 reveals a strong balance sheet for Nike with relatively little goodwill or intangibles
               and a current ratio around 3.0. Despite increasing net income by $500 million in fiscal 2017
               to $4.2 billion, notice on Exhibit 3 that Nike’s retained earnings dropped 4 percent in 2017,
               explained partly through $1.1 billion in dividend payments, but also by an anomaly called
               “deferred compensation” revealed on the company’s cash flow statement. It is very unusual for
               any company to have some amount of net income, pay less in dividends than that net income,
               and then have its retained earnings to decrease on the balance sheet.

               Segment Data
               Being very transparent, Nike reports revenues in several different categories. The two principle
               brands owned by Nike are Nike and Converse; Converse accounts for only 6 percent of rev-
               enues. Men account for about 57 percent of Nike revenues, followed by women with 26 ­percent,
               and kids account for 17 percent of revenues. Revenues from all three groups are growing

                                   wear, running, and the Jordan brand account for 30, 19, and 11 percent of revenue, respectively.
                                   Sportswear enjoyed a 14 percent revenue gain in 2017 and the Jordan brand enjoyed a 13 per-
                                   cent increase in revenues from 2016, both coming off double-digit revenue growth the prior year
                                   as well. The lowest revenue generating brands include Nike Basketball and Women’s Training,
                                   each representing 4 percent of revenues, followed by Action Sports and Golf, each representing
                                   2 percent of revenues. The three lowest revenue-generating brands discussed above all experi-

                                   brands mentioned revenues falling between 6 and 9 percent. Each of the four worse performing
                                   areas suffered revenue drops from 2015 to 2016 as well, with golf reporting another 18 percent
                                   revenue drop during this time period. Moving forward, it will be important for Nike to decide
                                   how to allocate resources across these product lines.
                                        Nike is in the retail business, having forward integrated over the years. Nike operates 384
                                   factory stores in the United States and 758 factory stores outside the U.S. Exhibit 4 reveals rev-
                                   enues and EBIT for Nike (not including Converse) in 2017. Canada accounted for 54 percent of
                                   all revenue in 2017. China generated the most EBIT per dollar of revenue received, followed by
                                   North America. Central & Eastern Europe, followed by Western Europe, generate significantly
                                   lower EBIT for every dollar of revenue, compared to other parts of the world. Both regions in
                                   Europe also suffered from a 16 percent drop in their respective EBIT contribution for 2017.
                                   Exhibit 4 reveals that Nike revenues in all markets in fiscal 2017 experienced a net positive rev-
                                   enue change in 2017 with Japan and China experiencing 17 and 12 percent revenue growths and

                   Exhibit 5 reveals Nike’s revenues by product type. Footwear is far and away the largest
               revenue-generating segment of Nike, representing 66 percent of 2017 sales. Both footwear and
               apparel sales were up 6 percent in 2017, but equipment sales were down 5 percent. Notable 2017
               changes in revenue by region and product type are as follows: apparel sales up 15 percent in
               Western Europe; footwear and apparel sales each up 13 percent in China and 17 and 21 percent,
               respectively in Japan; footwear sales up 11 percent in emerging markets. The largest loser on a
               percentage basis was equipment sales in North America, that were down 10 percent in 2017 as
               this division across all nations continues to struggle for Nike.
                   Exhibit 6 reveals Nike (not including Converse) revenues by customer type; wholesale
               customers account for 72 percent of 2017 revenues. Wholesale customers include Foot Locker,
               Dick Sporting Goods, and other merchants that purchase and sell Nike products, while direct-to-
               consumer includes Nike stores and online sales.

               Competitors
               Nike is the largest seller of athletic footwear, apparel, and equipment in the world, but there are
               aggressive rival firms, including Adidas, Under Armour, New Balance, and Puma, along with a
               few others in the production of athletic gear. In addition, as a forward integrated company, Nike
               competes with retail stores such as Foot Locker and other shoe retailers who ironically also sell
               Nike products. Nike represents nearly 50 percent of the whole athletic sportswear industry based
               on market capitalization on U.S. stock markets, followed by V.F. Corp at 14 percent. U.S. based
               Under Armour only represents 2.5 of the industry.
                   Exhibit 7 gives a quick glimpse at Nike compared to two rival firms. Note that Nike is far
               larger than Under Armour and Adidas combined.

                                   Adidas (www.adidas-group.com)
                                   Headquartered in Herzogenaurach, Germany, Adidas was founded in 1949 and operates over
                                   2,800 stores. Adidas owns Reebok, TaylorMade, and CCM Hockey products. Adidas reported
                                   $54 billion USD in 2016 with net income of 1.3 billion. Adidas is the largest sportswear manu-
                                   facturer in Europe and the second largest in the world, behind Nike. In 2015, professional bas-
                                   ketball player James Harden left Nike for Adidas, reportedly signing a 13-year contract worth
                                   $200 million. Adidas’s strategic plan is very similar to Nike’s; both companies use product
                                   development followed by heavy marketing, signing teams and players across almost all sports to
                                   market and promote their products.

                                   Foot Locker (FL)
                                   Headquartered in New York City, Foot Locker’s stock price soared between 2012 and 2017 in-
                                   creasing around 300 percent despite revenues only increasing 15 percent, and operating income
                                   declining 12 percent over the same time period. Founded in 1879, the company operates nearly
                                   3,500 stores and employs 15,000 full time workers across the United States, Europe, Australia,
                                   New Zealand, and Canada. However 80 percent of company sales come from the U.S. Also,
                                   70 percent of Foot Locker’s inventory for sale is Nike merchandise.
                                       Foot Locker uses the store-in-a-store concept used by many retailers where they have 217
                                   House of Hoops shops offering premium basketball products. Foot Locker also offers Lady Foot
                                   Locker, Champs Sports, Footaction, Runners Point, Sidestep, and Kid’s Foot Locker stores. Foot
                                   Locker sells Nike products along with other brands. With Nike’s forward integration strategy
                                   of opening their own retail stores and selling online, they directly compete with Foot Locker
                                   and all other ­merchants that sell Nike products at the retail level. There are 62 franchised Foot
                                   Locker stores in the Middle East and South Korea, as well as 15 franchised Runners Point stores
                                   in Germany.

               Under Armour (UA)
               Headquartered in Baltimore, Maryland, Under Armour (UA) was founded in 1996 by a former
               University of Maryland football player who desired a t-shirt that would whisk away perspiration
               rather than get soggy wet. The company has grown to be one of the most sought after brands
               among athletes around the world, being worn by some of the largest American college football
               and European soccer teams. Colleges such as the Maryland Terrapins, Auburn Tigers, South
               Carolina Gamecocks, and many more have contracts with UA to outfit their teams. English
               ­soccer team Tottenham Hotspur, Greek team Aris F.C. and Mexican club Deportivo Toluca F.C.
                all are outfitted by UA. Mega stars such as Tom Brady, Cam Newton, Bryce Harper, Michael
                Phelps, and many more, all sponsor and market UA products currently or at one time.
                    Under Armour was one of the pioneers to produce the compression and performance work-
                out gear and in 2017 introduced bioceramic materials in their sleepwear line of clothing that is
                supposed to reduce inflammation. The firm reported revenues of $4.8 billion in 2016 up from
                3.9 billion in 2015. However, the firm’s stock price dropped 75 percent from the high in 2015 to
                the low in 2017. Under Armour is well known for its partnership with PGA golfer Jordan Spieth,
                who recently launched his own golf shoe, “Spieth One.” The company is also widely known
                for its partnership with NBA star Stephen Curry, who is considered to be the “face of Under
                Armour’s footwear line.” Just like Nike and Adidas, Under Armour’s strategy is to pursue prod-
                uct development and follow up with heavy marketing.

               External Issues
               Athletic Shoe Stores
               The athletic shoe store industry in the United States generates over $15 billion in revenue, annually,
               with growth around 3 percent expected through 2022. The industry is fragmented with over 3,000
               businesses, many small mom-and-pops, with the two top players, Foot Locker and Nike, accounting
               for 32 and 18 percent of sales, respectively. Unlike many retail outlets, the industry is healthy and
               growing since more and more consumers worldwide are becoming more health conscious. In addi-
               tion, a growing trend referred to as athleisure grew over 40 percent between 2009 and 2016, where
               consumers are increasingly wearing athletic apparel in every day settings, including at work. Many
               work environments are calling workers back to the office and requiring increased levels of dress
               code, so it remains to be seen if the athleisure industry can continue to grow at such a rapid pace.
                   Online athletic shoe merchants are also growing, and, as athletic apparel becomes more
               popular, department stores that tend to offer business casual clothing are increasing their athletic
               shoe store spaces. In contrast to most clothing categories where women are the primary custom-
               ers, men account for nearly 60 percent of athletic shoe sales, with women and children both
               around 20 percent. The industry enjoys a fairly even distribution of sales volumes from varying
               age groups, but customers under age 55 account for about 75 percent of sales.
                   The total footwear market in the United States is worth $65 billion, but the fastest growing seg-
               ment of this industry is athletic footwear. China supplies over 70 percent of all shoes sold in the U.S.

               Athletic and Sporting Goods
               Athletic and sporting goods industry accounts for over $8 billion in U.S. revenue, annually, but
               experienced a negative growth rate around 3 percent between 2010 and 2017. Moving forward,
               the growth rate is expected to improve to upwards of 1 percent through 2022. The main driver
               of revenue is golf-related equipment, accounting for nearly 50 percent of industry revenues,
               followed by playground equipment, and fishing tackle and equipment around 7 percent each.
               Other types of sports equipment make up the remaining 36 percent. Football, soccer, basketball
               and other products attribute little to overall industry revenues, but this is not totally surprising
               considering just how equipment-intensive sports like golf and fishing can be. Apparel and shoes
               are not considered in the industry. Nike controls around 9 percent of the industry revenues in the
               U.S., with rival firm Calloway Golf owning 5 percent.

               Technology
               In 1996, Under Armour started offering compression apparel that helped to regulate body tem-
               perature and keep athletes warm in the cold and cool in the heat. Today, firms are becoming more
               advanced by adding computer technology to their products. Many firms are now experimenting

                                   with a chip powered by Intel. Google and Levi have partnered to produce a smart jacket worn by
                                   cyclists. The athletic sportswear industry is getting more technical every day.

                                   Inventory Turnover Problems
                                   Inventory turnover ratios have been declining for the past 10 years in the athletic sportswear
                                   industry. In 2006, for example, the inventory turnover ratio for the industry was 4.0, but in 2017
                                   the ratio has steadily dropped to 3.0. Nike is doing better than its peers on this ratio, reporting
                                   an inventory turnover ratio of 3.8 in 2017. Many analysts suggest the drop is simply from firms
                                   overestimating their inventory needs and by weaker customer traffic. Footwear accounts for less
                                   of the drop in inventory turnover than apparel. Retailers are inclined to have enough products
                                   to meet demand as hot ticket items attract people into stores. Thus, a question arises regarding
                                   whether having a high inventory turnover ratio is worth possibly running out of hot ticket items
                                   that firms certainly lose sales on, but also risk losing sales on impulse purchases by customers
                                   coming into the store. Having excess inventory, however, trains customers to wait for the clear-
                                   ance sales, ultimately hurting revenues and profits. Inventory management is a strategic issue
                                   facing all retain firms including Nike.

                                   Brand Polygamist
                                   Some experts in the apparel field are dubbing customers today as being “brand polygamist”
                                   referring to customer decrease in brand loyalty over the last decade. Customers are now purchas-
                                   ing increasingly based on price or extra product features rather than simply buying for the status
                                   of a logo or brand name. The trend has cut into gross margins and increased rivalry within the
                                   athletic sportswear industry. It also allows newer start up firms a larger chance as customers are
                                   increasingly willing to look at all options closer. Nike, for example, now has a NikeID program
                                   where they allow shoppers to design their own shoes, apparel, bags, and other items online in an
                                   attempt to attract more customers through personalization. However, schemes such as this are
                                   expensive, and firms like Nike are often not able to charge significantly more to offset the extra
                                   costs of say, producing 100,000 of the same blue shirts. Do not mistake the value of brands such
                                   as Nike, Adidas, Under Armour and others; they remain a powerful force in the industry, but
                                   simply having customers to purchase based on a logo alone is becoming extinct as customers
                                   become more Internet savvy.

                                   Direct-to-Consumer Sales
                                   There is increased momentum in the athletic sportswear industry for direct-to-consumer sales
                                   through factory shops, thus using the Internet to bypass traditional retailing merchants. An ad-
                                   vantage to Internet sales other than cutting out a middleman is that firms can design customer
                                   products as Nike does with NikeID. In total, e-commerce sales as a whole, including all indus-
                                   tries, grew 15 percent in 2016 versus the less than 3 percent growth for retail sales over the same
                                   time period.
                                       Using the direct-to-consumer business model, firms are also able to collect accurate data
                                   on customer’s habits who purchase versus don’t purchase and tailor advertising and marketing
                                   strategies to customers based on their likelihood to purchase or not purchase. For example, pro-
                                   files are developed for customers who are not likely to purchase without a coupon versus cus-
                                   tomers who will likely purchase either way; in addition, profiles may be developed to determine
                                   what length of time after a purchase do you need to offer an incentive to attract the customer to
                                   purchasing again. The information garnered from having a robust direct-to-consumer sales me-
                                   dium is arguably priceless.

                                   Future
                                   According to Global Industry Analysts, Inc., the global market for Sports and Fitness Clothing
                                   is projected to reach $231.7 billion by 2024. More and more people are living healthier life
                                   styles and participation in sports and fitness activities is growing. This is great news for Nike.
                                   The research reveals that sportswear is turning into a highly popular style statement and

               fashion trend. Additionally, the report points out that the Asia-Pacific region is expected to be
               the fastest growing region.
                    Market research firm Euromonitor International reports that sales of sportswear, which
               includes items such as yoga pants and activewear, is growing faster than any other apparel or
               footwear category. Specifically, both sports-inspired footwear and apparel is growing at about
               10 percent and 6 percent annually. Regarding the growth of sportswear apparel and footwear
               across regions, emerging markets such as India and Thailand are growing fastest, but even core
               markets such as the United States are also producing significant sports-inspired growth.
                    A few new firms that Nike is monitoring in the sportswear industry include RYU Apparel,
               Inc. (TSX: RYU.V) that produces urban athletic apparel. Founded in 2005, RYU’s financial re-
               sults for the 6 months ended June 30, 2017 included revenues in the second quarter of 2017 of
               $641,231, 113 percent higher than revenue of $300,773 during the same period in 2016. RYU
               continues to show a balanced ratio of apparel sales between men and women at 46 percent and
               54 percent, respectively. By reaching an underserved gap in the industry for men, and develop-
               ing the Beautiful Tough brand positioning that’s resonating with women, RYU currently derives
               17 percent of revenue from e-commerce with a target of reaching 30 percent by the end of 2018.
                    Nike is also monitoring Lululemon Athletica, Inc. (NASDAQ: LULU), an athletic apparel
               company for yoga, running, and training. Lulu creates transformational experiences for people
               to live happy, healthy, fun lives. Seemingly new companies arise all across the globe each month,
               desiring a piece of Nike’s market share, so Nike needs a clear strategic plan moving forward.

                                   Headquartered in Baltimore, Maryland, Under Armour (UA) apparel is sold and worn world-
                                   wide by athletes at all levels, as well as by customers with active lifestyles. UA products are
                                   used in training, fitness, athletics, and outdoor activities. UA has three different product materi-
                                   als: HeatGear, ColdGear, and AllSeasonGear to be worn when the weather is hot, cold, or mild,
                                   respectively. UA apparel is designed to regulate body temperature and improve performance,
                                   regardless of weather conditions, to increase mobility and comfort.
                                        UA is involved in Connected Fitness, offering digital fitness platform licenses and subscrip-
                                   tions, with MapMyFitness, MyFitnessPal, Endomondo, and UA Record applications. The ma-
                                   jority of UA sales are generated through wholesale channels such as sporting goods chains like
                                   Dick’s Sporting Goods (DKS), department store chains, and other retailers, but UA also sells
                                   through retail channels such as athletic departments, colleges, leagues, and teams. UA also sells
                                   products direct-to-consumers through factory stores globally.
                                        Despite a booming stock market in 2017, UA stock was among the worst performers in the
                                   S&P 500 the past two years, falling 30 percent in 2016 and 50 percent more in 2017; the stock
                                   rebounded some in 2018. A huge problem for UA is that specialty sporting goods retailers such
                                   as Dick’s Sporting Goods and Foot Locker that sell UA products are losing market share to
                                   Amazon and Walmart. Other UA distributors such as The Sports Authority, Gander Mountain,
                                   and Sports Chalet have all gone bankrupt in the past two years.
                                        Especially in North America, UA is struggling to compete with Nike and Adidas that domi-
                                   nate the athletic footwear and apparel industries. In May 2018, UA reported that its revenue in
                                   North America dropped slightly from a year ago. However, outside of North America, UA is
                                   doing well. For example, in Q1 of 2018, UA’s sales in Latin America increased 21 percent from
                                   the prior year period, accompanied by a 23 percent increase in the company’s Europe, the Middle
                                   East and Africa segment, and a 35 percent increase in the company’s Asia operations as compared
                                   to Q1 of 2017 a year earlier. But the company’s strength outside the USA is not sufficient to over-
                                   come trouble in its domestic operations because UA’s sales in North America account for nearly
                                   three-quarters of its revenue. UA’s North America segment lost money in Q1 2018.

                                   History
                                   Under Armour (UA) was founded in 1996 by a former University of Maryland football player
                                   (CEO Kevin Plank) who desired a t-shirt that would wick away perspiration rather than get
                                   soggy wet. At age 23, Kevin Plank developed a new t-shirt in his grandmother’s basement in
                                   Washington, D.C. after noticing that his compression shorts always stayed dry, but t-shirts had
                                   to be changed frequently as they became sweat-soaked. This observation led Plank to create a
                                   new compression t-shirt that wicked away sweat. After graduating, Plank provided this t-shirt
                                   to his former teammates who were playing in the NFL. After positive reviews, UA had t-shirt
                                   orders totaling $100,000 in 1997. UA’s first big break came when USA Today pictured Oakland
                                   Raiders quarterback Jeff George wearing UA apparel. In late 1997, Georgia Tech asked for 10
                                   shirts, ultimately leading to deals with Georgia Tech, Arizona State, and North Carolina State
                                   universities.
                                        The company has grown to be one of the most sought-after brands among athletes around
                                   the world, being worn by some of the largest American college football and European soccer
                                   teams. Colleges such as the Maryland Terrapins, Auburn Tigers, South Carolina Gamecocks,
                                   and many more have contracts with UA to outfit their teams. English soccer team Tottenham
                                   Hotspur, Greek team Aris, F.C., and Mexican club Deportivo Toluca F.C. all are outfitted by UA.
                                   Megastars such as Tom Brady, Cam Newton, Bryce Harper, Michael Phelps, and many more, all
                                   sponsor and market UA products.

                     UA designs, develops, markets, and distributes apparel, footwear, and accessories for men,
               women, and children worldwide. The company offers apparel in three styles: compression, fitted,
               and loose, and is designed to be worn in hot, cold, or normal weather. Footwear products include
               cleats for most all sports, running and basketball shoes, and even hunting boots. Accessories
               ­include gloves for football, baseball, golf, socks, and team uniforms. UA’s ­moisture-wicking fabri-
               cations are engineered in many different designs and styles for wear in nearly every climate to pro-
               vide a performance alternative to traditional products. Its products are sold worldwide and worn by
               athletes at all levels, from youth to professional, on playing fields around the globe. UA’s European
               headquarters are in Amsterdam’s Olympic Stadium, with a­ dditional offices in Denver, Hong Kong,
               Toronto, and Guangzhou, China. With about 76,000 employees, UA distributes their products
               through specialty retailers, department stores, outlet stores, and institutional athletic departments.
                     In the 2000s, UA expanded rapidly after outfitting Warner Brothers with apparel for two films,
               and an advertisement placed in ESPN Magazine generated $750,000 in sales. In 2003, UA became
               the outfitter of the now defunct XFL football league and launched its first TV advertisement with
               the motto “Protect this House.” In 2011, the company purchased 400,000 square feet of office
               space for $60.5 million. UA has new contracts with the NFL, NBA, and MLB to produce footwear,
               apparel, and accessories. Many European football teams such as Tottenham Hotspur and other
               rugby teams are outfitted with UA products. In 2012, UA’s women’s apparel became a major focus
               with strong sells reported in the company’s Studio and ArmourBra products.

               Vision/Mission
               UA’s vision (paraphrased) is “to empower athletes globally by providing innovative products.”
               The company mission (paraphrased) is “to enhance athletes’ performance through exemplary
               design and relentless pursuit of innovation.” Regarding UA’s vision, CEO Plank recently said
               (paraphrased): “Our long-term vision is for our women’s business to one day be larger than our
               men’s business, footwear to be larger than apparel, and our international business to be larger
               than our U.S. business.” UA also has all employees to agree to “four wills (paraphrased):” I
               will act responsibly, I will think like an entrepreneur, I will be innovative, and I will be a great
               teammate. “The biggest, baddest brand in the world, bar none” is also how Kevin Plank likes to
               describe his vision (paraphrased) for what UA can ultimately become.

               Internal Issues
               Organizational Structure
               UA reports its finances under four geographic segments: (1) North America, (2) Europe, the
               Middle East and Africa (“EMEA”), (3) Asia, and (4) Latin America. However, based on titles of
               executives, it appears UA operates from a divisional-by-region type structure with one person
               (Jason LaRose) handling North America and one person (Colin Browne) handling outside-North
               America. Exhibit 1 provides a possible depiction of UA’s organizational structure.

    572    STRATEGIC-MANAGEMENT CASE ANALYSIS

                                        UA’s co-founder Kip Fulks announced in October 2017 he was taking a sabbatical. Also dis-
                                   turbing to investors is that UA’s footwear chief, head of women’s and kids’ apparel, and its chief
                                   marketing officer also announced they were leaving after the company reported weak Q3 2017
                                   results. UA is in some disarray and has hired Patrik Frisk, the former CEO of shoe retailer Aldo,
                                   as president and chief operating officer. Before that hire, Plank also served as president. Analysts
                                   have said the move is a sign that Under Armour realizes it needs some fresh blood to fix its many
                                   problems at home. On a positive note, UA’s leading endorser, Steph Curry of the Golden State
                                   Warriors just led his NBA team to defeat the Cleveland Cavaliers to win the NBA championship.
                                   Note in Exhibit 1 above that all eleven top executives are male.

                                   Current Strategies
                                   Similar to Nike, UA’s strategies largely focus on product development followed by heavy
                                   marketing. UA has contracts with many top professional leagues including the NBA and
                                   NFL. UA will become a Connected Fitness partner with major league baseball (MLB) start-
                                   ing in 2020. Connected Fitness offers digital fitness subscriptions to consumers through
                                   MapMyFitness platform and the UA Record platform. UA acquired both Endomondo and
                                   MyFitnessPal platforms which includes MapMyRun and MapMyRide. As of 2017, about
                                   2 percent of revenues were derived from Connected Fitness, but the platform keeps data on
                                   customers, exposes customers to UA, and allows users to be rewarded with discounted UA
                                   gear for using the apps and staying fit.

                                   Marketing
                                   UA develops and markets products primarily for use in athletics, fitness, and other outdoor
                                   activities. UA attempts to drive demand through brand equity and increasing consumer aware-
                                   ness of their superior product. UA growth is largely dependent on sales from Dick’s Sporting
                                   Goods (Dick’s) and Foot Locker, with which it has developed store-within-a-store sales chan-
                                   nels. However, UA has been making great strides selling its products directly to consumers,
                                   with 31 percent of revenue in the latest quarter coming from direct sales, up from 25 percent
                                   6 years ­earlier. Wholesale sales to retail companies such as Dick’s Sporting Goods account for
                                   65 percent of sales, with 4 percent of sales being derived from Connected Fitness and Licensing
                                   in fiscal 2016.
                                        Like Nike, UA pays big money to secure endorsements for their products from high
                                   performing athletes who have significant influence in the NFL, NBA, MLB, and even high
                                   school teams. Sports stars such as Cam Newton and Tom Brady endorse and wear UA prod-
                                   ucts. Many fans become familiar with UA products seeing them worn by high performing
                                   athletes on a year-round basis. In addition to focusing on the large market leagues, UA also
                                   focuses on brand authenticity from a more grassroots level by hosting camps, clinics, and
                                   other activities for young athletes.
                                        UA uses broadcast, print, and social media outlets to promote the firm’s product. UA also
                                   also owns 162 outlet stores and 19 brand house stores in North America. Plank and his team
                                   are excellent marketers; company ads resonate with athletes and those who aspire to become
                                   athletes. UA’s bold logo and brash and edgy marketing campaigns inspire movement and physi-
                                   cal fitness, positioning the company well within the healthier lifestyle megatrend. Plank and his
                                   team relish their underdog image versus big rival firms; they love to operate within and promote
                                   an “us versus them” philosophy. This competitive fire has served UA well and has encapsulated
                                   many athletes and fans.

                                   Seasonality
                                   UA generates a large portion of its revenue during the third (Q3) and fourth (Q4) quarters
                                   of each year. In fact, Q3 and Q4 account for 35 percent more revenues than Q1 and Q2, and
                                   ­account for about 58 percent of yearly revenues. Q3 and Q4 correspond to football season
                                    and the holiday and winter seasons in much of the world. Fall and cooler weather gear also
                                    cost more.

                                   Finance
                                   UA reported a 3 percent increase in revenues in 2017, but notice in Exhibit 2 a large drop in
                                   net income from $256 million to negative $48 million, mostly attributed to higher operating

                                   quarterly DIO only exceeded 150 days in Q2 of the calendar year as the company builds stocks
                                   in preparation for the holiday season. Given that it is not going to be any different this year, we
                                   should be expecting the DIO to climb above 170 days (and potentially above 180 days) in Q2,
                                   something that has not happened since the 2008–2009 recessionary period.

                                   By-Product
                                   Exhibit 4 provides a breakdown of UA’s revenues by product. Note that apparel continues to
                                   be the strongest product offered based on net revenues, but accessories such as bags, hats, and
                                   gloves experienced higher percent increases over the most recent fiscal year. License revenues
                                   decreased due partly to fewer orders of hats and bags. About 66 percent of company revenues
                                   are derived from apparel in 2017, down from 80 percent in 2010, as other product lines are
                                   growing at a quicker pace.
                                         UA apparel is specifically engineered to replace traditional non-performance fabrics
                                   and replace them with the most cutting-edge products available. UA’s three products are
                                   ­marketed under Heatgear, designed for hot weather, Coldgear, designed for cold temperatures,
                                    and AllSeasonGear, designed for between the extremes. In addition to the three temperature
                                    ratings, all products also come in three fit types: compression (tight fit), fitted (athletic fit), and
                                    loose (­relaxed). All UA appeal products are designed to wick water away from the wearer to
                                    keep them as dry and comfortable as possible in any temperature or type of activity.
                                         Designed to cushion and manage moisture, UA makes footwear for virtually all sports,
                                    including running and even hunting boots. Although there was only a 2.7 percent increase in
                                    footwear sales in 2017, there was a nearly 50 percent increase in footwear sales in 2016. Other
                                    UA revenues are derived from licensing and Connected Fitness but only accounted for 4 percent
                                    of sales in 2017.

                                   Geographic Region
                                   Exhibits 5 reveals UA’s recent revenues derived from North American versus International mar-
                                   kets. UA reports revenues in four distinct geographic regions: (1) North America, (2) Europe,
                                   the Middle East and Africa (“EMEA”), (3) Asia, and (4) Latin America. Each geographic seg-
                                   ment operates in the same manner, to design, develop, market, and distribute UA products. As
                                   of fiscal 2017, 22 percent of revenues are derived from international markets. UA breaks down
                                   revenues by the four geographic regions and by Connected Fitness.

                                        For Q1 2018 that ended 3-31-18, UA’s revenue increased 6 percent to $1.2 billion, but the
                                   company’s net income loss widened to $30.2 million, or 7 cents a share, compared with $2.3
                                   million, or a penny per share, during the same period one year ago. UA’s Q1 2018 sales in North
                                   America fell 0.4 percent, while those in international markets climbed 27 percent. Outside North
                                   America sales now represent 24 percent of UA’s total sales. On a positive note, UA’s men’s training
                                   category helped drive apparel sales up 7 percent during Q1 2018, ­accompanied by footwear and
                                   accessories sales increasing 1 percent and 3 percent, ­respectively. UA’s strongest international seg-
                                   ment in Q1 2018 was Asia-Pacific, where sales increased 35 percent.

                                   Competitors
                                   UA faces competition from Adidas, Nike, New Balance, Reebok, and Puma along with a few
                                   others in the production of athletic gear. In addition, being forward integrated, UA competes
                                   with retail stores such as Foot Locker, Dick’ Sporting Goods, Bass Pro Shops, and many other
                                   firms. Competitors such as Nike and Adidas have copied NA’s designs and technology. The
                                   fabrics UA uses are not unique to them, and they do not control any patents on fabrics or pro-
                                   cesses. This has always been a huge problem for UA. Thus, it is all about branding for UA.
                                        UA’s branding strategy has not been perfect because UA’s stock declined as much as 75
                                   percent from 2015 to 2017, while over the same period the S&P 500 increased nearly 50 percent
                                   and Nike increased around 10 percent. Nike and Adidas have much larger resources to draw
                                   upon, thus competing long term may be difficult for UA. Competing for floor space at large
                                   retailers is also becoming more difficult since many stores now have their own store brands, in
                                   addition to private label brands, all competing for floor space.
                                        Exhibit 9 provides some comparative information for UA, and rival firms. Note that Nike
                                   and Adidas are 7 and 5 times larger revenue than UA, respectively, and in teams of market capi-
                                   talization, both rivals are larger than UA.

                                   Nike, Inc. (NKE)
                                   Headquartered in Beaverton, Oregon, Nike has over 70,000 full-time employees, operates 384
                                   U.S.-based stores and 758 international stores. Nike reported 2017 revenues and net income of
                                   about $34 billion and $4 billion, respectively, both figures increasing nicely from the prior year.

               However, for Nike’s second quarter (Q2) of fiscal 2018, revenues for the Converse division of
               Nike were $408 million, down 4 percent, due to faltering sales in North America. Nike’s net
               income for Q2 2018 decreased 9 percent to $767 million. For both Q1 and Q2 of fiscal 2018,
               the company’s footwear sales declined 5 percent and the company’s equipment sales dropped
               8 percent in North America. Thus, rival companies are eating into Nike’s financial performance
               in the United States. However, outside North America, Nike is doing really well, growing both
               revenues and net income in double digits.
                    Nike has recently doubled down on designing shoes on an individual basis by building its
               new Nike By You Studio in New York City. The studio utilizes augmented reality and projec-
               tion systems to custom-design shoes that are then produced and available within an hour for the
               customer. The company has a team of 1,000 designers to oversee development and production of
               customer Nike shoes, incorporating such designs as Nike’s Pro Hijab for Muslim athletes.
                    Nike is in the retail business, having forward integrated over the years. Nike operates 384
               factory stores in the United States and 758 factory stores outside the United States. Exhibit 10
               reveals revenues and EBIT for Nike (not including Converse) in 2017. Canada accounted for 54
               percent of all revenue in 2017. China generated the most EBIT per dollar of revenue received,
               followed by North America. Central & Eastern Europe, followed by Western Europe, generate
               significantly lower EBIT for every dollar of revenue, compared to other parts of the world. Both
               regions in Europe also suffered from a 16 percent drop in their respective EBIT contribution
               for 2017. Exhibit 10 reveals that Nike revenues in all markets in fiscal 2017 experienced a net
               positive revenue change in 2017 with Japan and China experiencing 17 and 12 percent revenue
               growths and North America only growing revenue by 3 percent.

                                   manufacturer in Europe and the second largest in the world, behind Nike. In 2015, p­ rofessional
                                   basketball player James Harden left Nike for Adidas, reportedly signing a 13-year contract
                                   worth $200 million. Adidas’s strategic plan is very similar to Nike’s; both companies use
                                   ­product d­ evelopment followed by heavy marketing, signing teams and players across almost all
                                    sports to market and promote their products.

                                   Foot Locker, Inc. (FL)
                                   Like many players in the industry, Foot Locker’s stock rose hugely between 2012 and 2017
                                   ­increasing around 300 percent despite revenues only increasing 15 percent and operating ­income
                                    declining 12 percent over the same time period. The company operates nearly 3,500 stores and
                                    employs 15,000 full time workers across the United States, Europe, Australia, New Zealand, and
                                    Canada; however, 80 percent of sales derive from the United States. Foot Locker has bought into
                                    the store-in-a-store concept used by many retailers where they have 217 House of Hoops shops
                                    offering premium basketball products. Foot Locker also offers Lady Foot Locker and Kids Foot
                                    Locker stores. Foot Locker sells UA and Nike products along with other brands. UA competes
                                    with Foot Locker and all other merchants that sell UA products at the retail level.

                                   External Issues
                                   Athletic Shoe Stores
                                   The athletic shoe store industry in the United States generates over $15 billion in revenue annu-
                                   ally with growth around 3 percent expected through 2022. The industry is fragmented with over
                                   3,000 businesses, many small mom and pops with the two top players Foot Locker and Nike
                                   accounting for 32 and 18 percent of sales, respectively. Unlike many retail outlets, the industry
                                   is healthy as a growing number of consumers in the United States are world wild are becoming
                                   increasingly health conscious. In addition, a growing trend referred to as athleisure grew over
                                   40 percent between 2009 and 2016 where consumers are increasingly wearing athletic apparel
                                   in every day settings including at work. Many work environments are calling workers back to
                                   the office and requiring increased levels of dress code, so it remains to be seen if the athleisure
                                   industry can continue to grow at such a rapid pace. Online merchants are also growing, and
                                   as athletic apparel becomes more popular, department stores that tend to offer business casual
                                   clothing are increasing their athletic shoe store spaces. Unlike most all clothing categories where
                                   women are the primary customers, men account for nearly 60 percent of athletic shoe sales with
                                   women and children both around 20 percent. The industry enjoys a fairly even distribution of
                                   sales volumes from varying age groups but customers under 55 account for 75 percent of sales.
                                   Nike holds nearly 50 percent of the athletic-footwear industry based on market capitalization,
                                   followed by V.F. Corp at 14 ­percent. UA has only 2.5 percent of the athletic-footwear industry.

                                   Technology
                                   Many athletic apparel firms are now experimenting with t-shirts made of conductive yards that
                                   can even transmit heart rate and other data directly to the user’s doctor. A spinoff of Samsung,
                                   IOFIT is a sports-smart shoe where golfers have their swings and balance analyzed. Chinese
                                   based Xiaomi released in 2017 a smart running shoe with a chip powered by Intel. Google and
                                   Levi have partnered to produce a smart jacket worn by cyclists.

                                   Brand Polygamist
                                   Some experts in the apparel field are dubbing customers today as brand polygamists in reference
                                   to customers’ decrease in brand loyalty over the last decade. A decrease in brand loyalty is a
                                   serious problem for most firms in the industry as customers are now purchasing increasingly on
                                   price or extra product features rather than simply buying for the status of a logo or brand name.
                                   The trend has cut into gross margins and increased rivalry within the industry. It also allows
                                   newer start-up firms a larger chance as customers are increasingly willing to look at all options
                                   closer. UA has purchased several apps for phones and smart watches and developed their own to
                                   attract customers to the UA product lines. Nike for example now has a NikeID program where
                                   they allow shoppers to design their own shoes, apparel, bags and other items online in an attempt
                                   to attract more customers through personalization. However, schemes such as this are expensive
                                   and firms like Nike are often not able to charge significantly more to offset the extra cost of say,

               producing 100,000 of the same blue shirts. Do not mistake the value of brands such as Nike,
               Adidas, UA, and others; they remain a powerful force in the industry but simply having custom-
               ers to purchase based on a logo alone may be extinct.

               Direct-to-Consumer Sales
               There is increased momentum in the athletic sportswear industry for direct-to-consumer sales
               through factory shops, thus using the Internet to bypass traditional retailing merchants. An
               ­advantage to Internet sales other than cutting out a middleman is that firms can design customer
                products as Nike does with NikeID. In total, e-commerce sales as a whole, including all indus-
                tries, grew 15 percent in 2016 versus the less than 3 percent growth for retail sales over the same
                time period.
                     Using the direct-to-consumer business model, firms are also able to collect accurate data on
                customers’ habits who purchase and don’t purchase and tailor advertising and marketing strate-
                gies to customers based on their likelihood to purchase or not purchase. For example, profiles
                are developed for customers who are not likely to purchase without a coupon versus customers
                who will likely purchase either way; in addition, profiles may be developed to determine what
                length of time after a purchase do you need to offer an incentive to attract the customer to pur-
                chasing again. The information garnered from having a robust direct-to-consumer sales medium
                is arguably priceless.

               Future
               According to Global Industry Analysts, Inc., the global market for Sports and Fitness Clothing
               is projected to reach $231.7 billion by 2024. More and more people are living healthier ­lifestyles
               and participation in sports and fitness activities is growing. This is great news for UA. The
               ­research reveals that sportswear is turning into a highly popular style statement and fashion
                trend. Additionally, the report points out that the Asia-Pacific region is expected to be fastest
                growing region.
                      Market research firm Euromonitor International reports that sales of sportswear, which
                ­includes items such as yoga pants and activewear, is growing faster than any other apparel or
                 footwear category. Specifically, both sports-inspired footwear and apparel are growing at about
                 10 percent and 6 percent annually. Regarding the growth of sportswear apparel and footwear
                 across regions, emerging markets such as India and Thailand are growing fastest, but even core
                 markets such as the United States are also producing significant sports-inspired growth.
                      A few new firms that UA is monitoring in the sportswear industry include RYU Apparel,
                 Inc. (TSX: RYU.V), that produces urban athletic apparel. Founded in 2005, RYU’s financial
                 results for the 6 months ended June 30, 2017, included revenues in the second quarter of 2017
                 of $641,231, 113 percent higher than revenue of $300,773 during the same period in 2016. RYU
                 continues to show a balanced ratio of apparel sales between men and women at 46 percent and
                 54 percent, respectively. By reaching an underserved gap in the industry for men, and d­ eveloping
                 the Beautiful Tough brand positioning that’s resonating with women, RYU currently derives
                 17 percent of revenue from e-commerce with a target of reaching 30 percent by the end of 2018.
                      Some analysts contend that UA has lost its identity in the athletic sportswear space by col-
                 laborating with rapper A$AP Rocky to become more of a brand for everyday wear rather than a
                 performance line made famous for its compression tees. UA’s apparel for women definitely lags
                 niche competitors such as Lululemon, Fabletics, and Gap Inc.’s Athleta which are seen as more
                 fashionable.
                      UA is monitoring Lululemon Athletica, Inc. (NASDAQ: LULU), an athletic apparel com-
                 pany for yoga, running, and training. Lulu creates transformational experiences for people to
                 live happy, healthy, fun lives. Seemingly new companies arise all across the globe each month
                 desiring a piece of UA’s market share, so UA needs a clear strategic plan moving forward.

                                   Headquartered in Medina, Minnesota, Polaris operates mainly through four segments: Off-Road
                                   Vehicles (ORV), Snowmobiles, Motorcycles, and Global Adjacent Markets. Polaris is best
                                   known for their snowmobiles, yet that segment only represents 7 percent of total company sales.
                                   Polaris produces power-sports vehicles, including motorcycles, snowmobiles, and All-Terrain
                                   Vehicles (ATV). On May 21, 2018, Polaris announced that for the first time ever the company
                                   was named to the Fortune 500, coming in at a ranking of 496. The Fortune 500 for 64 years has
                                   been offered the premier ranking of U.S. companies by total revenues for their respective fiscal

                                        Polaris has a defense (military) segment. In November 2016, the U.S. Marine Corps signed

                                   Vehicle (UTV), the vehicle is designed to be diesel-powered and can run on JP-8 fuel. The
                                   Marines bought the unarmored ATVs because they can fit inside an MV-22 Osprey aircraft,
                                   enabling them to be deployed from long distances, to provide logistics support to ground combat
                                   units, assisting them to travel and transport supplies quicker and easier than previously on foot.
                                   The vehicles can carry four troops and have a small cargo bed capable of carrying 1,500 lb
                                   (680 kg) of payload.
                                        In 2017, Polaris issued nearly a dozen recalls on a number of products, and later that year
                                   recalled over 400,000 of its machines. However, in October 2017, Polaris reported that sales
                                   were up by 25 percent for the quarter, setting a record of $1.48 billion, and almost tripling net
                                   income at $81.9 million. Most companies would experience difficulty recovering from such
                                   catastrophic setbacks, yet Polaris charges ahead doing better than ever as the year 2017 ends at
                                   a record level.

                                   History
                                   Founded in 1954 in Roseau, Minnesota, Polaris’ legacy actually started back in 1945 with fore-
                                   runners Edgar Hetteen, his brother Alan, and their close friend David Johnson who together
                                   wanted a vehicle to ride on the snow. The three decided to start a never before heard of type
                                   of business—making snowmobiles. Edgar Hetteen would eventually be described in the
                                   Snowmobile Hall of Fame in St. Germain, Wisconsin, as the father of the snowmobile. Edgar
                                   dropped out of school after the eighth grade in 1934. The three guys founded a business and
                                   named it Hetteen Hoist & Derrick. The three guys desired to create a vehicle that could travel
                                   through snow to make hunting locations more accessible. No similar product existed at that time
                                   anywhere in the world.
                                       Producing a version of the snowmobile in 1955, the company earned a monopoly in the
                                   industry by demonstrating its toughness, reliability, and durability. However, in 1960, Edgar
                                   became disgruntled with his brother and their close friend, so Edgar quit working for Polaris
                                   and started his own snowmobile company that today is named Arctic Cat—a large, fierce rival
                                   to Polaris.
                                       Polaris throughout the 1960s produced snowmobiles amidst growing competition world-
                                   wide. In 1964, it released the Comet, in 1965 the Mustang, and in 1985 it released the Trailboss,
                                   and later the Polaris Rocky Mountain King (RMK). Polaris opened a manufacturing plant in
                                   Monterrey, Mexico, in 2010 to go with its sister facility in Osceola, Wisconsin, that still operates
                                   today. In January 2015, Polaris purchased the entire electric motorcycle business from Brammo,
                                   based in Ashland, Oregon. Production of electric motorcycles began at Polaris’ factory in Spirit
                                   Lake, Iowa, during the second half of 2015. Polaris also manufactured Victory and Indian motor-
                                   cycles at the Spirit Lake factory.

                    In 2016, Polaris opened a new 600,000-square-foot facility in Huntsville, Alabama, that
               employs about 1,700 workers. In January 2017, Polaris’ Chairman and CEO Scott Wine
               announced they would be shutting down Victory Motorcycles. However, the company will con-
               tinue to honor warranties and produce parts for Victory Motorcycles for the next 10 years.
                    Polaris snowmobiles hold the most number of wins in the “World’s Longest Toughest
               Snowmobile Race,” the Iron Dog—a 2,000-mile race across Alaska. Polaris is currently expand-
               ing into the clothing and accessory industry.
                    On May 10, 2018, Polaris announced formation of Club Slingshot, a national owners
               group that is designed to embrace and recognize the loyal Slingshot owners across the country.
               Slingshot is Polaris’ open air, three-wheeled roadster that delivers “The Ultimate Joyride,” for its
               more than 25,000 new and used Slingshot owners who will receive a complimentary one-year
               membership, which includes special offers, access to events and rides, as well as a first-edition
               Slingshot owners magazine. The Slingshot vehicle was initially offered in late 2014. New
               Slingshot vehicles are powered by 2.4L engines that provide 173 horsepower and 166 ft-lbs of
               torque. Prices range from $19,999 to $30,999.

               Vision/Mission
               Polaris’ vision focuses on excellence and innovation in its products and services, with the over-
               arching goal of generating excitement and enthusiasm among its customers around the globe.
               The vision can be viewed on the company’s website: https://www.polaris.com/. Polaris does not
               appear to have a formal mission statement but does have some guiding principles that are a few
               words: “best people, best team, safety and ethics always, and customer loyalty.”

               Internal Issues
               Organizational Structure
               Based on executives’ titles, Polaris appears to operate from a divisional-by-product type organi-
               zational design, but with no COO or CAO. This is a large organization for every top executive
               to report to the CEO. Note in Exhibit 1 there is only one female among the top executives, Stacy
               Bogart, the firm’s General Counsel.

               Strategy
               Polaris aims to become an $8 billion global enterprise by 2020. The company actively engages
               in strategic planning. Polaris has a history of successfully acquiring and divesting businesses to
               continue on a path of strategic improvement. Yet to their credit, Polaris reports minimal goodwill
               on their balance sheet. Some recent notable divestures include exiting the jet-ski market in 2004
               after a 12-year stint. Polaris ceased production of its Breeze line of on-road vehicles in 2011, and

    582    STRATEGIC-MANAGEMENT CASE ANALYSIS

                                   acquired GEM and Goupil to fill this void. Since 2014, Polaris has been striving to achieve the
                                   following strategic objectives (paraphrased):
                                       5–8 percent annual organic growth
                                       7$2 billion from acquisitions & new markets
                                       733 percent of Polaris revenue coming from outside the United States
                                       710 percent net income margin
                                        Polaris purchased Taylor-Dunn Manufacturing Company in 2016. Based in Anaheim,
                                   California, Taylor-Dunn produces industrial vehicles serving a broad range of commercial,
                                   manufacturing, warehouse, and ground-support customers. Also in 2016, Polaris entered into
                                   an arrangement with Transamerican Auto Parts (TAP), “a privately held, vertically integrated
                                   manufacturer, distributor, retailer and installer of off-road Jeep and truck accessories.” Polaris
                                   paid $668 million for TAP and used debt to secure the deal.
                                        In 2011, Polaris purchased the Indian Motorcycle Company. Polaris is committed to
                                   rebranding the product line, and 2017 seems to be a breakout year. For example, the 2017
                                   Slingshot, Victory, and Indian motorcycles offered an inventory of 24 models. The lower end
                                   of the price range will be $9,000 and the higher will be $30,000. Polaris will phase out the
                                   Victory line to continue to develop the Indian engine, the primary reason consumers purchase
                                   the motorcycle.
                                        Polaris purchased the electric energy company Brammo, Inc., in April 2015. Brammo
                                   ­designs electric vehicles and the two companies have been working together since 2011.

                                   Marketing
                                   In 2016, Polaris spent $342.2 million on advertising, promotion, and publicity, up from $316.7
                                   million in 2015 and $314.5 million in 2014. Polaris has a network of about 1,800 independent
                                   dealers in North America, 11 subsidiaries, and 45 distributors in 125 countries outside of North
                                   America. The company’s brands include RZR and Ranger ATVs, Indian and Victory motor-
                                   cycles, and Polaris Rush snowmobiles. Snowmobiles are sold to dealers in the United States and
                                   Canada; many dealers also carry Polaris ORVs. A little more than half of all Polaris dealers in
                                   North America sell snowmobiles.

                                   Finance
                                   Polaris’ financial statements are provided in Exhibits 2 and 3. Note the 20.19 percent increase in
                                   revenues in 2017. Note also the 24 percent decline in long-term debt in 2017.

                                   Segment Data
                                   Polaris is quite transparent in reporting its revenues and gross profit by product and region.

               Exhibit 5 that Polaris still primarily does business in the United States.

               Information Systems
               Polaris is expanding its RIDE Command, an onboard rider information system, across its Indian
               Motorcycle segment, as well as Polaris GENERAL and RZR product lines. The Ride Command
               connects Polaris customers to other riders and friends to plan an event and otherwise coordinate
               the entirety of the Polaris experience. Polaris likely generates access to a wide swath of user-data,
               preferences, and access to additional marketing opportunities for a strong core of Polaris users.

                                   This in turn can be used to more effectively target customers, identify customer trends, and

                                   Research and Development
                                   Polaris employs 850 personnel in the research and development (R&D) arm of the corporation.
                                   The company’s R&D function is divided into two segments: (1) improving existing products and
                                   (2) designing new offerings. Polaris places a premium on improving engine functionality, striv-
                                   ing to reduce noise levels, increase fuel efficiency, and generate more power. The company also
                                   owns Swissauto Powersports LTD, an engineering firm focusing on engine efficiency and inno-
                                   vative vehicles. In 2016, Polaris spent $185.1 million on R&D, that followed up $166.4 million
                                   and $148.5 million the prior two years, respectively.

                                   Production Activities
                                   Polaris assembles its products in 18 facilities in Minnesota, Iowa, Wisconsin, Mexico, and
                                   elsewhere in the world. To save costs and improve component part quality, many of the firm’s
                                   product lines are vertically integrated. Plastic injection molding, welding, clutch assembly, and
                                   painting are all produced in-house. Items such as fuel tank, tires, seats, and instruments are pur-
                                   chased from third-party vendors.
                                        Polaris has an effective inventory management process called the Maximum Velocity
                                   Program (MVP) where ORV orders can be placed at 2-week intervals for high volume dealers.
                                   Smaller dealers can utilize a similar process. The new process helps to keep costs down and keep
                                   inventories at manageable levels. While ORV orders can be placed at any time, snowmobile
                                   orders must be placed in the spring and secured by a deposit. Victory motorcycle orders are cur-
                                   rently under MVP testing.

                                   Operations
                                   While Polaris maintains its corporate headquarters in Medina, Minnesota, it sustains a
                                   nationwide presence with facilities in Wyoming, Minnesota; Roseau, Minnesota; Osceola,
                                   Wisconsin; Spirit Lake, Iowa; Milford, Iowa; Huntsville, Alabama; Vermillion, South Dakota;
                                   Spearfish, South Dakota; and Wilmington, Ohio. Internationally, Polaris has a manufacturing
                                   and distribution presence in a number of offices including, but not limited to, Winnipeg, Canada;
                                   Melbourne, Australia; Auckland, New Zealand; Coleshill, England; Askim, Norway; Ostersund,
                                   Sweden; Frankfurt, Germany; and an office near Barcelona, Spain. Exhibit 4 details those loca-
                                   tions. Polaris has about 1,800 dealers in North America and 1,700 dealers overseas through 80
                                   distributors. The company has about 400 dealers for its Victory and Indian motorcycles, and 200
                                   dealers in North America.

               major players in the ORV market are estimated to hold a combined market share of 57.7 percent.
               Concentration levels are much higher in the snowmobile segment, especially with major manu-
               facturers Polaris and Arctic Cat commanding the segment.
                    Honda and Polaris are the two major manufacturers of ATVs in the United States. Polaris
               itself accounts for 27.6 percent of total industry revenue. IBISWorld estimates that the level of
               industry concentration will gradually increase during the next 5 years. The supply chain of this
               market comprises raw material suppliers, component manufacturers, ATV manufacturers, dis-
               tributors, and buyers. The market for ORVs is highly consolidated with the presence of global
               as well as regional players. Major ORV manufacturers other than Polaris are Honda Motor
               Co., Ltd., Yamaha Motor Co., Ltd., BRP Inc., Arctic Cat Inc., Deere & Company (John Deere),
               Kubota Corporation, and Kawasaki Motors Corp.

               Bombardier Recreational Products, Inc. (BRP)
               Based in Valcourt, Canada, BRP designs, develops, manufactures, distributes, and markets
               power sports vehicles and propulsion systems. The company manufactures and sells all-terrain
               vehicles (ATVs), side-by-side vehicles (SSVs) and roadsters, as well as seasonal products
               consisting of Lynx snowmobiles and personal watercrafts (PWCs). Bombardier also produces
               propulsion products consisting of engines for outboard and jet boats, karts, motorcycles, and
               recreational aircraft. Bombardier’s diversified portfolio of brands and products includes Can-Am
               ATVs, SSVs and roadsters, Ski-Doo and Lynx snowmobiles, Sea-Doo PWCs, and propulsion
               systems consisting of Evinrude outboard boat engines and Rotax engines for jet boats, karts,
               ­motorcycles, and recreational aircraft. In addition, Bombardier operates a parts, accessories, and
                clothing (PAC) business. BRP products are sold through a network of dealers, distributors, and
                to original equipment manufacturers.

               Arctic Cat, Inc. (ACAT)
               On January 25, 2017, it was announced that Arctic Cat will be acquired by Textron in a $247
               million cash transaction. However, Arctic Cat is a North American manufacturer of s­ nowmobiles
               and all-terrain vehicles as well as snowmobile suits and accessories. Founded by Polaris
               founder, Edgar Hetteen, Arctic Cat was formed in 1960 and was originally based in Thief River
               Falls, Minnesota. In 2016, the headquarters was relocated to a more prominent location in down-
               town Minneapolis. Also in 2016, most of the ATV/UTV engineering was moved to St. Cloud,
               Minnesota, in the same facility that produces the Arctic Cat engines. Arctic Cat continues the
               majority of their manufacturing, along with snowmobile engineering, in Thief River Falls,
               Minnesota.

               Harley-Davidson, Inc. (HOG)
               Headquartered in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, Harley-Davidson (Harley) is an iconic brand world-
               wide and provides a unique customer experience few companies can match. Its ticker symbol
               HOG and its Harley Owners Group (H.O.G.) both stem from the nickname for the famous
               Harley motorcycle. Harley is America’s largest motorcycle producer with 2017 revenue of $5.6
               billion, down from $5.9 billion the prior year.. The company’s net income declined in 2017 to
               $521 million from $692 million the prior year. Harley has sales in about 97 countries and ser-
               vices over 1,400 independently owned dealers.

               Honda Motor Company Ltd. (HMC)
               Headquartered in Tokyo, Japan, Honda sells motorcycles, but also cars, outboard motors,
               ­generators, and other various power equipment products. For Honda’s last fiscal year ended on
                March 2017, revenues in the company’s motorcycle segment decreased 4.95 percent to ¥1,716.1
                billion ($15.77 billion). For that fiscal year, Honda’s motorcycle unit sales rose 6.3 percent to
                11 thousand motorcycles. Operating profit of the motorcycle segment decreased 6.1 percent to

                                   Improving their operating loss from ¥10.2 billion ($93.7 million) in 2015 to an operating loss of
                                   ¥0.9 billion ($8.2 million) in 2016.

                                   External Issues
                                   The global off-road vehicles (ORVs) market is projected to reach $11.1 billion in 2022. A
                                   booming global economy and increasing disposable income is spurring recreational and touring
                                   activities, an advancement in the ORV technology, and increasing usage of ORVs in the agricul-
                                   ture and military operations are the major factors proliferating the demand for ORVs globally.
                                   The United States is the largest ORV market due to its large stretches of natural terrain, unpaved
                                   roads, and large ranches and farms across the country.
                                        The global ORVs market is segmented based on vehicle type as ATV and SSV. SSV is likely
                                   to witness higher growth through 2020 due to a significant shift from ATVs to SSVs. SSV offers
                                   advantages over ATVs, such as better riding experience, rollover protection bars, and improved
                                   mobility. These factors significantly reduce the number of accidents and injuries as compared to
                                   ATVs.
                                        Based on region, North America is expected to remain the largest market for ORVs over the
                                   next 5 years. The United States accounted for more than 50 percent of the global ORV sales in
                                   2016. Asia-Pacific is relatively a small market but is likely to report the highest growth through
                                   2020, driven by an increasing demand for powersports in China, Australia, and India.

                                   Future
                                   Polaris’ Indian Motorcycle line is gaining market share against Harley-Davidson, and the
                                   company reported that retail sales were up 16 percent in Q3 of 2017. Polaris is eliminating the
                                   Victory brand in order to focus on Indian and could create a brand to rival Harley-Davidson in
                                   the long term.
                                        Polaris sales for Q4 of 2017 increased 18 percent to $1,431 million, up 17 percent, with the
                                   majority being from organic growth. Q4 2017 sales of $1,431 million were up 18 percent from
                                   $1,218 million for Q4 of 2016. The company’s Q4 2017 net income was $31 million, down from
                                   net income of $63 million the prior year quarter. Motorcycle segment sales totaled $103 million,
                                   a decrease of 2 percent compared to $104 million reported in Q4 of 2016. Gross profit from
                                   Motorcycle segment for Q4 of 2017 was $5 million compared to $1 million in Q4 of 2016.
                                        On May 17, 2018, Polaris announced that the U.S. Army was purchasing 20 of its MRZR
                                   X vehicles for soldier trials. The MRZR X is a robotic vehicle to be used by infantry brigade
                                   combat teams for the next year of trials as part of the Army’s Squad Multipurpose Equipment
                                   Transport (SMET) program. The vehicle can be manned or non-manned so it helps the Army
                                   transition from manned to unmanned vehicles. The new robotic vehicle complements the world-
                                   wide commonality with the MRZRs already in service in the United States and more than 30
                                   allied nations. The new vehicle has the capability for remote control, teleoperation, follow-me,
                                   leader-follower, and full autonomy. Thus the new vehicle can be used as an autonomous resup-
                                   ply vehicle, warfighter-driven squad carrier, logistics support vehicle, rescue mission enabler,
                                   and high-speed casualty evacuation capability. Polaris initially had teamed up in 2017 with
                                   Applied Research Associates Inc. (ARA), and Neya Systems LLC.
                                        Polaris has updated its strategic plan and aims to generate annual sales growth of greater
                                   than 5 percent compounded annually, and net income growth of greater than 15 percent through
                                   2022. The company could use a fresh look at its strategic plan since analysts agree that competi-
                                   tiveness in the industry is growing.

               PT Matahari Putra Prima Tbk.—2022

               hypermart.co.id
               Headquartered in Tangerang, Indonesia, PT Matahari Putra Prima Tbk. (Matahari) is a large
               Indonesian chain of retail stores with a product range that includes food, clothes, chairs, dog
               beds, cosmetics, tableware, and household appliances. The word “matahari” in Indonesian means
               “the sun”; many of the company’s products are handmade outdoors, in the sun, by local artisans
               in small villages throughout Indonesia and Southeast Asia. The company’s customers are primar-
               ily retail stores (online, catalog, and brick-and-mortar) and interior design firms. Matahari owns
               and operates Hypermart, Primo, Foodmart, Hyfresh, Boston Health & Beauty, FMX, and Smart
               Club across 200 locations in Jakarta and around Indonesia.

               History
               Founded in 1986, Matahari has become a trusted retailer in Indonesia. The firm became public
               in 1992 on the Jakarta and Surabaya Stock Exchanges and began supermarket operations in
               1995. Boston Health & Beauty was launched in 1995 and Hypermart in 2004. In 2012, the firm
               divested its non-core businesses. Matahari remodeled many of its locations in 2015 and con-
               tinued building new stores. In 2018, it reduced its exposure in the business-to-business (B2B)
               market and increased its focus on selling and providing services directly to consumers through
               its Hypermart and Foodmart locations before launching Hyfresh in 2019, further concentrating
               its efforts on the consumer.
                    The COVID-19 pandemic severely hurt Matahari and other supermarket retailers, as social dis-
               tancing and general travel restrictions in Indonesia were stringent. In response to the pandemic and
               the change in consumer behavior buying patterns, Matahari has been trying to become more of an
               online company, but so far that transition has been a challenge. The company is at a critical juncture
               in its history and needs a clear strategic plan to weather the continual storms it faces.

               Vision/Mission
               There is no posted vision or mission statement for the company at the corporate website or in the
               firm’s most recent Annual Report. A plausible vision statement for Matahari could read something
               like this: To become the premier, multi-format, go-to shopping destination throughout Indonesia.

               Internal Issues
               Organizational Structure
               Unlike most corporations, Matahari provides an organizational chart in its 2020 Annual Report
               to reveal its top executive reporting relationships. As shown in Exhibit 1, Matahari has no COO
               within its executive ranks; nor does it have presidents of divisions. The company does, however,
               have a Director of Large Stores Format and a Director of Small Stores Format, implying a decen-
               tralized design with two profit centers based on customer size. CFOs across the world are taking
               on more and more of the responsibility traditionally held by a COO, and perhaps that is also true
               of Matahari. If so, then Herry Senjaya, CFO of Matahari, is a busy person.
                    Being well organized is vitally important for success in any company, and there are guide-
               lines for when various types of structure should be utilized. You can find many of these guide-
               lines in Chapter 7, “Implementing Strategies: Management and Marketing Issues.” Based on
               the guidelines and various organizational structure journal articles listed in the References
               section of this case, it is clear that extensive improvements are needed in Matahari’s or-
               ganizational design. Probably the most effective type of structure for Matahari would be
               a divisional-by-product-type design, where the products are the various types of stores the
               company operates, such as Hypermart, Primo, Foodmart, Hyfresh, Boston Health & Beauty,
               FMX, and SmartClub. There should probably be a president or similar head responsible for

                                    each of these operations. Vagueness is disastrous both in strategic planning and in organiza-
                                    tional design, and at present there is too much vagueness in Matahari’s structure. In addition,
                                    this company seems sufficiently large to warrant having a COO for all those new presidents
                                    to report to, rather than everyone in the company reporting to the CEO.

                                    Financial Data and Statements
                                    As indicated in Matahari’s recent income statements provided in Exhibit 2, the company had a
                                    rough 2020, with the COVID-19 pandemic discouraging consumers and companies worldwide.
                                    Note that revenues were down 22 percent and the company’s net income was again negative,
                                    albeit a bit less so than the prior year. Matahari’s business apparently suffered in 2020 directly
                                    as pandemic lockdowns prevented people from getting out of their homes and going shopping.
                                    Trends such as this are quite worrisome for Matahari’s shareholders, who expect to see at least
                                    a 5 percent top-line (revenues) and for the bottom line (net income) to increase annually.
                                        As shown in Matahari’s recent balance sheets provided in Exhibit 3, the company’s property,
                                    plant, and equipment declined 15 percent in 2020, while long-term debt increased 396 percent.
                                    Basically, the company is apparently using debt to meet its payroll and pay expenses as profits
                                    have been nonexistent. Matahari needs a clear strategic plan moving forward.

               Strategy
               Matahari has vaguely disclosed that the company has two distinct strategies, the first focusing
               on consumer retailing and providing quality fresh products and the second on expanding its
               omnichannel online business and improving digital payments. The first strategy seems to imply
               an increased focus on fresh fruit and vegetables, but a closer reading of what the company calls
               “fresh” is much more broad; it also includes more emphasis on consumer goods and many other
               types of groceries. In fact, the term “fresh” mostly likely means any product that has a shelf life
               of perhaps less than a year.
                   Regarding the second strategy, Matahari is increasingly shifting toward an omnichannel pres-
               ence by forming partnerships with firms to become more virtual. In 2021, the firm expanded its
               partnership with Tokopedia, a technology company with the leading marketplace in Indonesia;
               Matahari opened 95 virtual stores on Tokopedia’s platform, which boasts more than 100 million
               active monthly users who purchase food and household products. While Matahari is by some
               estimates the fifth largest grocery store chain in the country, the company claims this agreement
               with Tokopeida makes them the largest online grocery platform in Indonesia. This agreement
               follows on the heels of the merger of Tokopeida and GoJek, another firm that Matahari works
               closely with, which launched 31 stores in 2021 before quickly expanding to 76 virtual stores.
                   In 2020, Matahari reported that 5 percent of its total sales were derived from online sources,
               compared to just 0.1 percent in 2019. Online sales were expected to amount to 10 percent of
               Matahari’s total sales in 2021—a rapid increase.

    590    STRATEGIC-MANAGEMENT CASE ANALYSIS

                                       While the firm calls the two above items strategies, they are perhaps best considered tactics.
                                   The true strategy of Matahari would center more around how to allocate resources around the
                                   large format Hypermart or the smaller format stores such as Foodmart and Primo. Both of what
                                   the firm calls strategies above can be applied to large or smaller format stores. But it is vital to get
                                   the large- versus small-store balance correct because having fresher products on the shelf may
                                   not matter much if you are operating the incorrect size-store balance or have stores in the wrong
                                   locations.

                                   By-Segment Information
                                   Broadly speaking, Matahari has three segments, 1) Large Stores, 2) Small Stores, and 3)
                                   Wholesale, as indicated in Exhibit 4. More specifically, however, the company has seven seg-
                                   ments or store chains, as discussed below.

                                   Hypermart
                                   As shown in Exhibit 5, Hypermart accounted for 85 percent of Matahari’s total revenue in 2020.
                                   Matahari is in the process of transforming Hypermarts into smaller, more efficient stores and
                                   increasing store numbers. In addition, much attention is being given to improving the shopping
                                   experience by modernizing existing stores to international standards and consistency. The com-
                                   pany’s Hypermart stores cater to everyone but target middle-income families, offering products
                                   such as groceries, fresh food, electronics, and soft-line products. Hypermart products are tracked
                                   closely to determine profit margins and best practices for distribution networks and centers to
                                   supply stores. Improved tracking has enabled Matahari to offer products with higher margins,
                                   focus more on high-demand products, and drop low-demand products. Hypermarts are shifting
                                   focus increasingly to individual consumers rather than B2B.

               Foodmart
               Foodmart, Matahari’s second largest brand, produces about 10 percent of its total revenues.
               Focusing on convenience and providing a modem atmosphere, the brand supplies a wide range of
               both local and international products. Customers also can purchase ready-to-eat meals to enjoy
               at home. Foodmart tends to focus on higher-quality products, especially fresh foods. Foodmart
               Primo is more upscale, focusing on affluent customers, and offers many international products, a
               greater variety, and a range of ready-to-eat take away meals. Matahari operates 25 such Foodmart
               Primo stores across Indonesia.

               Hyfresh
               The most recent new type of store owned and operated by Matahari is Hyfresh, which was
               launched in 2019. Hyfresh’s stores are smaller and focus on middle-class communities where
               customers need to shop every day due to smaller living spaces at home or inadequate means of
               keeping food fresh. Fresh groceries and attractive prices are part of Hyfresh’s strategy. There are
               9 Hyfresh stores as of 2020.

               Boston HBC
               Standing for Boston Health and Beauty, Boston HBC offers Indonesian customers a health and
               beauty concept, as the name suggests. Select stores offer health consultations and even a phar-
               macy. The brand struggled in 2020, opening no new stores and closing 7 stores permanently, for
               a total of 62 stores in operation. The closure of 10 percent of the stores in 2020 is concerning; it
               might be explained away by the pandemic, but 9 stores were closed in 2019, before the outbreak.
               Extra care should be taken when analyzing this concept’s fit going forward.

               FMX
               FMX is the convenience store arm of Matahari. These stores are located near malls, apartments,
               railway stations, and other high-traffic public places in local communities. FMX is different from
               other convenience stores in Indonesia in offering more modern layouts, huge ready-to-eat food
               and drink sections, and assortments of grocery items focusing on snacks. Customers can even
               pay their bills at FMX stores. Matahari is optimistic over FMX’s growth potential and plans to
               continue store expansion. However, in 2020, the company closed 2 FMX locations permanently
               and now operates 14 such stores.

               Supporting Function
               To service its range of stores, Matahari operates 3 distribution centers. Just over 50 percent of
               all sales are derived from merchandise flowing through these centers. Far and away the largest
               center is in Balaraja, with a capacity of 43,000 pallets, followed by the center in Porong, with a
               capacity of 30,000 pallets. The smallest distribution location is in Cibitung, with a capacity of
               4,200 pallets. Radio frequency scanning, voice picking technology, and single-pick technology
               allow for paperless fast operations and enhance data collection applications.

               Segment-based Performance Data
               As indicated in Exhibit 6, Matahari’s Hypermarts generate almost all of the company’s revenues,
               but moving forward, other segments may be expanded substantially even as the firm downsizes
               the average square footage of each Hypermart to the extent possible.

               External Issues
               Demographics of Indonesia
               It may come as a surprise to many non-Indonesians that the country is the fourth most populous
               nation in the world, with over 270 million people, behind China, India, and the United States.
               Nearly 60 percent of the population of Indonesia resides on the island of Java. The country is
               spread across hundreds of islands. The largest city, Jakarta, has nearly 10 million residents, fol-
               lowed by Surabaya, with nearly 3 million people. The country’s GDP per capita is $3,907 as of
               2021. Agricultural imports reached nearly $20 billion in 2020. The Indonesian government has
               set agricultural self-sufficiency as its goal.

                                       About 57 percent of Indonesians live in urban areas, with the main cities being Jakarta,
                                   Surabaya, Medan, and Bandung. The literacy rate in Indonesia is high at 95.7 percent, and the
                                   size of households is also pretty high—41 percent are comprised of 4–5 persons. The average
                                   monthly salary in Indonesia is Rp 12,100,000 ($862); women on average earn 23 percent less
                                   than men in Indonesia. There are several hundred ethic groups in the country, but the most com-
                                   mon are Javanese (42 percent), Sundanese (15 percent), and Malay, Madurese, and Batak (3
                                   percent each). Although Indonesia is a Muslim majority country, alcohol consumption is allowed
                                   nationwide except in the province of Aceh. Nevertheless, there are numerous constraints on ad-
                                   vertising alcoholic beverages.

                                   E-commerce in Indonesia
                                   Indonesians are rapidly embracing e-commerce, and the country’s e-commerce market is expected
                                   to grow from $32 billion in 2020 to $83 billion by 2025 (it was $21 billion in 2019). According
                                   to Statista, fashion is the largest category of goods being purchased online in Indonesia. Analysts
                                   report that about 50 percent of Indonesian consumers conduct Google searches and read customer
                                   reviews before making their purchase. The top four social media platforms utilized by Indonesian
                                   internet users are, in order of popularity, YouTube, WhatsApp, Instagram, and Facebook. The top
                                   four e-commerce sites in Indonesia in rank order are Tokopedia, Shopee, Bukalapak, and Lazada;
                                   Tokopedia and Shopee are nearly on par with each other and together garner about 80 percent of all
                                   views and purchases.
                                       Non-urban areas of Indonesia do not have access to regular banking services such as credit
                                   cards or bank transfers, so cash on delivery is commonly used. Any business that services such
                                   areas—like Matahari—should consider having a logistics partner to help facilitate the cash-
                                   on-delivery method of payment. However, the Indonesian government promises to soon have a
                                   standard single-code QR system (QRIS) as part of their Indonesia Payment Systems Blueprint
                                   2025. Go-Jek recently launched digital payment options such as GoPay and PayLater. Similarly,
                                   Shopee offers Shopee Pay. OVO is another popular eWallet payment option. There are even some
                                   “buy-now-pay-later” options in Indonesia, such as PayLater, which is the third most popular
                                   fintech in Indonesia (about 58 percent of the Indonesian population are aware of its offering). At
                                   end of Q1 2020, Matahari launched Chat & Shop by WhatsApp, which is supported by the Park
                                   & Pickup and BELLA (Single National WhatsApp Number) features.

                                   Annual Food Sales in Indonesia
                                   Exhibit 7 reveals the dollar amount of various types of food purchased by consumers in Indonesia
                                   in 2020. Notice that rice is number one, but surprisingly soft drinks are number two, followed by
                                   dairy products. Matahari is continually monitoring its own sales of different foods to determine
                                   the most effective mix to provide on the shelves of its various stores.

               The top 5 food retailers in Indonesia are shown in Exhibit 8. Note that Matahari’s largest chain
               of stores, Hypermart, comes in a distant fifth based on sales; it is sixth based on store numbers.
               In 2020, there were over 4.4 million traditional stores in Indonesia, which equates to about one
               for every 60 people. Convenience stores totaled just over 36,000, followed by supermarkets
               at 1,457. Forecourt and hypermarkets totaled 730 and 337, respectively. By comparison, there
               is one supermarket for every 185,000 people in Indonesia, revealing just how prevalent tradi-
               tional stores are.
                   Regarding the competitive landscape in which Matahari functions, Exhibit 9 reveals the top 5
               food retailers in Indonesia by percentage of outlets. Notice that Salim Group’s Indomaret domi-
               nates the food retailer industry in the country, followed by Alfamart. These two rival firms hold a
               whopping 94 percent of the outlets in the country (among the top five). Matahari (which placed

                                   Strategy Considerations
                                   Through 2021, the COVID-19 pandemic continued to wreak havoc on hypermarket and super-
                                   market chains in Indonesia, especially those located in malls or shopping centers, which seem
                                   to suffer the most from low to no customer traffic. For example, grocery retailer Hero Group
                                   (operator of the Hero and Giant stores) saw 2020 sales decline by 33 percent to $418 million
                                   compared to 2019, and in mid-2021 it was forced to close all Giant stores (approximately 75
                                   hypermarket and supermarket stores across Indonesia).
                                       Amid the hardship, some retail businesses in Indonesia are nevertheless growing. For exam-
                                   ple, convenience stores have benefited from having smaller locations closer to residential areas.
                                   Retailers such as Supra Boga Lestari (operator of Ranch Market, Farmers Market, the Gourmet
                                   and Day 2 Day) have launched their own online shopping apps to provide instant delivery to cus-
                                   tomers. This strategy enabled Supra Boga Lestari to report a sales revenue increase of 26 percent
                                   year-over-year in 2020 due to store expansion and increased efficiencies. Indonesia’s second
                                   largest convenience store, Alfamart, reported a 2 percent increase in revenues in 2020, reaching
                                   sales of $3.5 billion.
                                       There is hope, therefore, for Matahari to turn its faltering revenues and profits around, likely
                                   through more transitioning to online and to smaller store formats. But the company has seven
                                   segments, as described in the case, and allocating resources effectively across them is now more
                                   important than ever. Prepare a comprehensive strategic plan that includes a portfolio analysis,
                                   SWOT analysis, and QSPM analysis for the CEO of Matahari. Include in your plan a new and
                                   improved organizational chart for the company based on sound management principles. Recall
                                   that the majority of people purchase their food items from roadside stands or small shops. Should
                                   Matahari focus increasingly on smaller shops or are the large shops the way to go? Should the
                                   firm divest all operations from serving businesses and focus entirely on the consumer? What
                                   should the firm do with respect to its one large wholesale property? Being the fifth largest gro-
                                   cery in the country, Matahari is still small enough to really offer a distinctive service. Perhaps the
                                   firm should only focus on middle- to upper-income customers? The possibilities for Matahari are
                                   many and the firm is in desperate need of a strong strategic plan. Develop a set of recommenda-
                                   tions for CEO Dickson that you feel will lead Matahari to success, based on a thorough external
                                   and internal analysis of the competitive climate in Indonesia. With some rival firms closing and
                                   divesting stores and properties, there is opportunity for Matahari to capitalize on turmoil in the
                                   industry. Based on your analyses, what is your recommended course of action for the company
                                   to pursue over the 2021–2025 period?

                                   The name “Emirates Group” includes two entities: 1) the well-known Emirates Airline and
                                   2) the aviation services company Dubai National Air Transport Association (stylized as dnata).
                                   Headquartered in Garhoud, Dubai, near the Dubai International Airport, Emirates Airline (or
                                   simply Emirates) is the state-owned global airline of Dubai. The largest airline in the Middle
                                   East, Emirates provides passenger and freight services to about 100 countries, while dnata pro-
                                   vides ground handling, cargo, catering, and travel services in 35 countries. (Note that Emirates
                                   Airlines and dnata do not form a group according to International Financial Reporting Standards
                                   [IFRS], so much of the Emirates Group’s Annual Report presents separate data for the two enti-
                                   ties, but the name “Emirates Group” refers to the two entities combined.)
                                       More than 20 brands of the Emirates Group are described on its corporate website, including ev-
                                   erything from catering to food services, to travel agencies, to ground handling and cargo services—
                                   this is a diversified, backward- and forward-integrated, well-managed, fast-growing enterprise.
                                   Today, Emirates serves 155 airports in 81 countries from its hub in Dubai. However, the COVID-19
                                   pandemic hit the Emirates Group hard in 2020–2021, and corporate revenue dropped 65.8 percent
                                   to AED 35.586 billion, while the number of employees dropped 30.8 percent to 75,145. All flights
                                   to and from the UAE were suspended from March 25, 2020, to May 25, 2020. All UAE-based
                                   Emirates Group employees in 2020 took a six-month salary cut, and the Government of Dubai
                                   injected AED 11.3 billion into the Emirates Group in 2020 to keep the company solvent.
                                       Emirates’s response to the ban on air travel during the COVID-19 shutdown included modify-
                                   ing 19 Boeing 777-300ER passenger aircraft by removing seats in the cabin to make room for more
                                   cargo and then adding these to their 777-freighter fleet. Revenues from carrying cargo comprised
                                   60 percent of the Group’s revenues in 2020; nevertheless, dnata incurred its first loss ever (AED
                                   1.8 billion) in fiscal 2020. But even during the pandemic, dnata secured new contracts, such as
                                   ground handling in Australia for Qantas Airlines and a 5-year ground handling contract for services
                                   at Canada’s Vancouver International Airport. By March 31, 2021, the pandemic was under greater
                                   control—though by no means disappeared—and Emirates was flying again to 120 destinations.

                                   History
                                   The founder of the Emirates Group was Sheikh Ahmed bin Saeed Al Maktoum, who started the
                                   company under the name dnata in 1959. The name “Emirates” was conceived in March 1985
                                   with backing from Dubai’s royal family; its first flight was from Dubai to Karachi, Pakistan,
                                   in October 1985. The airline grew rapidly and by 2005 had a workforce of 25,000, making it
                                   Dubai’s largest employer. Emirates’s passenger numbers reached 23 million in 2009. At the end
                                   of March 2020, Emirates employed 59,519 persons, including 21,789 cabin crew, 4,313 flight
                                   deck crew, 3,316 in engineering, 12,627 listed as “other,” 5,376 employees at overseas stations,
                                   and 12,098 at subsidiary companies.
                                       In 2020–2021, for the seventh consecutive year, Emirates won the Best Airline award at the
                                   Business Traveler Middle East Awards, and won in the categories Best First Class, Airline with
                                   the Best Cabin Crew, and Best Airport Lounge. In December 2020, Emirates won the Airline
                                   of the Year award at the annual Aviation Business Awards Conference. Emirates is one of the
                                   world’s fastest-growing airlines, but the pandemic still plagues all airlines.

                                   Vision/Mission
                                   If the Emirates Group has a written vision or mission statement, it is not available on either the corpo-
                                   rate website or the 2020 Annual Report. A likely vision and mission could read something like this:
                                   Vision
                                   To provide passenger and cargo air flight services wherever people live and work, today and tomorrow.

               Strategy
               In 2020–2021, Emirates retired 9 Boeing 777 aircraft and 5 A380 aircraft while adding 3 new
               A380 aircraft. The company is committed to maintaining a young fleet of aircraft.
                   The Emirates Group is very active in three key areas of environmental sustainability: 1) emis-
               sions reduction, 2) responsible consumption, and 3) wildlife and habitat conservation. The com-
               pany’s 2020–2021 Annual Report (pages 58–64) details many activities the company engages in
               to assure its excellence in these areas.

                                   This services provider is subdivided into several revenue contributing parts:
                                    1. Airport Operations: Due to strong cargo business, this segment reported only an 8 percent
                                       decline in tons of cargo handled in fiscal 2020–2021, to 2.7 million tons.
                                    2. Catering: This segment reported a decline of 82 percent of meals uplifted, down to 16.9
                                       million, due to the ban on and restrictions on air travel.

                   3. Travel: Revenue in 2020–2021 also dropped 96 percent to AED 130 million due to
                      pandemic restrictions.
                   4. Airport Handling SpA: Dnata’s subsidiary in Italy now offers full ground and cargo
                      services at Milan Malpensa Airport (MXP).
                   In terms of actual segment reporting, however, dnata has five segments as revealed in Exhibit
               3, which provides financial highlights of dnata’s 2020–2021 fiscal year. Note the drastic declines
               due almost exclusively from COVID-19 bans on and restrictions on travel.

               Emirates Group Consolidated Financials
               As indicated earlier in the case, IFRS do not allow the Emirates Group to combine Emirates
               Airlines and dnata financials into the firm’s consolidated financial statements. The consolidated
               statements provided in Exhibits 4 and 5 are thus for the Emirates Group, excluding the dnata
               operations. Note the drastic declines along almost all rows of the statements.

                                   Competitors
                                   Emirates Airlines competes with dozens of airlines globally, but 5 seem to be the company’s
                                   major rivals: 1) Singapore Airlines, 2) Etihad Airways, 3) Air China, 4) Qantas Airways, and 5)
                                   Malaysia Airlines Berhad.

                                   Emirates Airline’s Competitors
                                   Singapore Airlines is based out of the Singapore Changi Airport and has been ranked as the
                                   world’s best airline at least four times by UK-based Skytrax and more than 20 times by Travel
                                   & Leisure magazine. As of August 2021, Singapore Airlines operates a fleet of 154 Airbus and
                                   Boeing passenger aircraft and 7 Boeing 747-400 cargo aircraft.
                                       Etihad Airways is headquartered near Abu Dhabi International Airport in the UAE and is the
                                   second-largest airline in the country after Emirates. Etihad operates about 100 Airbus and Boeing
                                   aircraft and flies to about 120 passenger and cargo destinations in the Middle East, Africa,
                                   Europe, Asia, Australia, and North America.
                                       Founded in 1988 and headquartered in Beijing, Air China is one of China’s big three airlines.
                                   As of March 2021, Air China operates 459 Airbus and Boeing aircraft, with another 110 planes
                                   on order. The company flies passengers and cargo virtually everywhere on the globe.
                                       Headquartered in the Sydney suburb of Mascot, New South Wales, Qantas Airways is the
                                   largest airline company in Australia. Qantas owns Jetstar, a low-cost airline based in Australia. In
                                   March 2021, Qantas reported a half-year revenue loss of AU$1.08 billion, a 75-percent decline
                                   from the prior year, and passenger counts dropped 83 percent. All airlines need COVID-19 to go
                                   away, and in August 2021 Australia was basically under lockdown due to the lingering pandemic.
                                       Malaysia Airlines is the flag carrier and largest airline company in Malaysia; it is also a
                                   member of the OneWorld Airline Alliance. With its headquarters at Kuala Lumpur International
                                   Airport, as of January 2021, Malaysia Airlines flies to 59 destinations in Asia, New Zealand, and
                                   Australia.

                                   Dnata’s Competitors
                                   The International Air Transport Association (IATA) reports that airlines outsource more than 50
                                   percent of the ground handling that takes place at airports globally. Ground handling includes
                                   everything a plane may need between the time it arrives at a terminal gate and the time it departs
                                   on its next flight. Speed, efficiency, and accuracy are important in ground handling services to
                                   minimize turnaround time, as faster turnarounds yield higher profits.
                                       Dnata competes with dozens of firms globally in providing airport and aviation services,
                                   such as Egypt Air Ground Services, HAVAS Ground Handling Company, Bahrain Airport
                                   Services, Qatar Aviation Services, New Star Aviation Services, Airmach Aviation, MDFS
                                   Philippines, SATS Ltd., and SAL Ground Services. Two of dnata’s rivals are 1) Angkasa Pura
                                   and 2) Shenzhen Airlines.
                                       Angkasa Pura, comprised of Angkasa Pura I and II, are government entities of the
                                   Indonesian Ministry of State Owned Enterprises. Pura I is headquartered in Kamayoran,
                                   Jakarta, while Pura II is at the Soekarno–Hatta International Airport in Tangerang, Banten.
                                   Much like dnata, Pura I provides ground handling services at about 20 airports in central

               and eastern Indonesia, while Pura II does the same at about 20 airports in western Indonesia.
               Angkasa Pura could easily expand to become a more serious rival for dnata.
                   Shenzhen Airlines is headquartered at Shenzhen Bao’an International airport in Shenzhen,
               Guangdong, China. A large airline and a member of the Star Alliance, Shenzhen Airlines has
               about 200 Airbus and Boeing jets currently in service flying throughout Asia, Africa, Middle
               East, Australia, and Europe. However, it also handles airport and aviation services at numerous
               locations.

               External Issues
               All airlines and airport ground handling service companies sorely need the COVID-19 pan-
               demic to terminate because any interruption to passenger travel for any reason seriously re-
               duces both revenues and profits. To make money, airlines need to keep their planes flying and
               ground handlers need planes to land and depart. Anything that keeps billion-dollar assets such
               as passenger planes from operating severely erodes profitability. Two-thirds of the world’s pas-
               senger planes in 2020 lay unused on runways or in hangars, and upwards of 18 airlines filed
               for bankruptcy during that time. The airline industry posted a loss of about $320 billion in
               passenger revenue in 2020.

               How Do Airlines Make Money?
               Airlines receive the bulk of their revenue from tickets but also generate income from fees, food,
               credit card usage, frequent-flyer programs, movement of cargo, and—at times—government
               bailouts. Emirates uses all these means to make money.
                   On average, business travelers account for about 12 percent of global airline-ticketed pas-
               sengers but 60 to 75 percent of revenues, as business-class tickets can cost upwards of 10
               times the price as coach. Corporations are often willing to pay for business-class flights as
               well-rested and less-stressed employees are worth the additional cost of business-class travel.
               Although the advent of Zoom and other means of video conferencing is curtailing business
               travel significantly, video conferencing is nothing new, and business travel has been in demand
               for the last 20 years.
                   Affluent travelers are a significant source of income for airlines as they often purchase
               business-class seating, and Zoom is no replacement for a fancy vacation. To take advantage
               of business and high-end vacation travelers, airlines are catering more and more to business-
               class customers. Even traditionally low-cost firms such as Texas-based Southwest Airlines and
               European carrier RyanAir are competing more aggressively for these customers.
                   Airlines benefit immensely from their frequent flier programs and also from credit cards
               linked to these programs. High-income customers tend to purchase more flights with these cards.
               Moreover, the use of these cards in day-to-day purchases provides significant data for marketing
               and strategy. These frequent flier miles programs can be worth more than the very airlines that
               own them; they are so profitable that airlines are able to offer more attractive pricing on tickets
               as well as more and better routes. Many of the rewards earned by customers are not redeemed,
               further profiting the airlines.

               Personalized Websites
               Customers today demand increased flexibility and options in the products and services they
               buy, and this is also true of how they purchase airline tickets. This shift in buying behavior has
               challenged airlines to produce increasingly modern websites that are even more user-friendly
               and personalized. Exhibit 6 reveals, perhaps surprisingly, that with respect to home pages that
               are dynamic and effective in nature, low-cost carriers are performing significantly better than
               full-service carriers. Offering customers customizable features, nudging tactics, personalized
               widgets, etc. create a meaningful experience and help increase brand loyalty.
                   Exhibit 7 reveals that airline travel in terms of passengers is increasing around
               3.5 percent annually and is expected to continue at this rate once travel restrictions normalize.
               The Asia-Pacific region leads the world, with 33 percent of all global travel originating or con-
               cluding in this region. However, one of the main drivers of growth in air travel is the doubling
               of low-cost carriers’ market share from 2005 to 2020. The global middle class is also rapidly
               growing, especially in China, and many countries and cities are actively engaged in airport
               infrastructure investment.

                                   Conclusion
                                   As the pandemic wanes, consumer demand for both business and leisure air travel is expected to
                                   return and grow upwards of 5 percent annually even as video conferencing and online meetings
                                   become the new normal. The Emirates Group has achieved a global reputation for excellence and
                                   seems poised to take advantage of the new normal. But Emirates faces many challenges, threats,
                                   and competitors.
                                       But there are opportunities for the Emirates Group too. For example, as mentioned in the
                                   case, the pandemic bankrupted numerous airline companies, and these could be acquired by
                                   Emirates at a good price. Similarly, there are also many airport ground handling service compa-
                                   nies that could be acquired by dnata. Can you identify the best candidates on both fronts for CEO
                                   Sheikh Al Maktoum to consider bringing into the fold?

                   There are many viable strategic options that could benefit the company moving forward.
               Strategic planning is about making tough choices, as no firm can do everything that will benefit
               the enterprise; there simply are not enough funds or people, especially in lean times with the
               effects of the pandemic still lingering.
                   The Emirates Group needs a comprehensive strategic plan developed to most effectively al-
               locate scarce resources. Can you conduct the research and perform the analyses necessary to
               provide this strategic report to the CEO and top management of the company? Make sure that
               your report includes a recommended new vision and mission statement for the company as no

                                   Headquartered in Boston, Massachusetts, General Electric (GE) ranked thirteenth among the
                                   Fortune 500 largest companies by gross revenue. In the 2017 letter to shareholders, GE CEO
                                   John Flannery promised to “own up” to the current state at GE with employees and sharehold-
                                   ers. 2017 was a difficult year for GE financially, losing over $5 billion with CEO Flannery call-
                                   ing 2017 “a very tough year.” Most people associate GE with some appliance in their homes or a
                                   light bulb, and GE does make these devices, but the firm also is heavy into building jet engines,
                                   high-tech medical devices, and wind turbines. Every two seconds around the world a plane takes
                                   off powered by a GE jet engine, and GE’s MRI’s (Magnetic Resonance Imaging) cat scans and
                                   other medical devices help doctors save over 3,000 lives daily.
                                        GE employs 313,000 people that live and work in over 180 countries. The company is still
                                   highly diversified. For example, in March 2018, GE’s Marine Solutions division was chosen by
                                   ASMAR Shipyards in Talcahuano, Chile, to provide an integrated marine propulsion system for
                                   the Chilean Navy’s new Antarctic icebreaking Polar Class vessel. The new vessel will anchor
                                   the Chilean navy’s Antarctic expedition for search and rescue missions, scientific research,
                                   logistic support, and resupplying bases in the Chilean Antarctic Territory. The 350-foot long
                                   vessel will have GE’s full marine propulsion system, including diesel-electric propulsion, GE’s
                                   International Maritime Organization’s (IMO) Tier 3-compliant diesel engine, a complete propul-
                                   sion shaft line and propeller, a tunnel thruster, SeaStream Dynamic Positioning (DP), and vessel
                                   automation system. With the GE installed power of 14.5 megawatts, the vessel will be capable of
                                   breaking 1 meter of ice at 3 knots.
                                        On May 23, 2018, GE’s corporate value declined about $10 billion in market capitaliza-
                                   tion that single day, in what amounted to the worst GE trading day percentage-wise loss since
                                   the height of the financial crisis in early 2009. That day GE’s stock price dropped 7.4 percent
                                   as CEO John Flannery spoke at an annual Electrical Products Group conference in Florida. GE
                                   is in financial trouble as it divests assets and faces a dilemma of whether to use those funds to
                                   shore up the firm’s balance sheet or distribute those funds to shareholders. The iconic American
                                   company needs a good strategic plan going forward.

                                   History
                                   In 1890, Thomas Edison brought his various businesses together under the name Edison General
                                   Electric Company. Upon a merger with then rival, Thomson-Houston Company, General
                                   Electric (GE) was formed. GE was incorporated in 1892 and in 1896 became one of the original
                                   12 companies listed on the newly formed Dow Jones Industrial Average. GE remains today the
                                   only original company listed on the Dow Index. GE has been buying and selling companies for
                                   over a century, becoming one of the most diversified companies on the planet. However, this
                                   diversification eventually led to its demise and today GE is divesting, trying to become more
                                   homogeneous. Under the leadership of Chairman and CEO Jack Welch from 1981 to 2001, GE
                                   became the classic, revered diversified company that many other firms tried to emulate. When
                                   Welch retired from GE in 2001, he received the largest severance payment ever— $417 million.
                                   Welch had joined GE in 1960 as a chemical engineer. From 1973 to 1979, Welch was head of
                                   GE’s strategic planning division. Welch became GE’s youngest CEO in 1981.
                                        In February 2017, GE announced intentions to close its gender gap by hiring 20,000 women
                                   in technical roles by the year 2020. GE is also seeking to have a 50:50 male to female represen-
                                   tation in all entry-level technical programs. In October 2017, GE announced they would be clos-
                                   ing research and development centers in Shanghai, Munich, and Rio de Janeiro. The company
                                   spends about $5 billion on R&D annually.

                    On May 9, 2018, GE Renewable Energy announced its first wind energy project in Chile
               with Arroyo Energy Compañía de Energías Renovables Limitada whereby GE will supply six
               3.6 MW wind turbines with 137-meter rotors and 110-meters tower. The machines will be in-
               stalled at Chile’s El Maitén and El Nogal wind sites in the south of the country, representing a
               total of 21,8 MW. Chile already has 1.7 GW of wind power capacity installed and 4.9 GW of re-
               newable energy capacity overall. The Chilean government’s “Energía 2050” plan calls for about
               60 percent of the country’s energy demands to be met with renewable energy sources by 2035,
               and 70 percent by 2050.
                    GE’s new $200 million new corporate headquarters will be named “GE Innovation Point.”
               Completion of the project is scheduled for mid-2019.

               Vision/Mission
               Although GE does not use the terms vision and mission, the corporate website implies that the
               firm’s vision is to become the world’s premier digital industrial company. The corporate website
               also implies that GE’s mission is “to be a focused industrial leader of unmatched scale and diver-
               sity, committed to shareholder value, with high-value businesses in critical industries, positioned
               to lead in a new digital era.”
                     GE is a customer-oriented company. Instead of solely focusing on the number of gas tur-
               bines, wind turbines, jet engines, or CT scanners produced and sold, the firm’s ultimate purpose
               is couched as follows (paraphrased): We work to help children in distant villages get access to
               electricity for the first time; we work to help travelers who get home safely; we work to help
               patients receive better diagnoses and treatments in the moments that matter most; we understand
               customer needs and deliver outcomes for them—when we all view business this way, we end up
               in a good place for our customers, employees, and owners.

               Internal Issues
               Organizational Structure
               CEO John Flannery was appointed CEO of GE in August 2017 and Chairman in October 2017.
               He has a 30-year career at GE, most notably on turning around GE’s Healthcare segment that
               generates about $20 billion in revenues annually. CFO Jamie Miller is new since November
               2017 along with four other new CEOs of divisions. Mr. Flannery is moving quickly in putting
               new people in high positions within the firm. In addition, GE’s 23-member board is being re-
               duced in 2018. As illustrated in Exhibit 1, GE’s organizational structure is basically divisional,
               with numerous CEO’s, but with all 24 top executives reporting to CEO Flannery.

    606    STRATEGIC-MANAGEMENT CASE ANALYSIS

                                   Current Strategies
                                   GE’s 2017 Annual Report describes the firm’s overall strategy as focusing upon four key areas:
                                   1) Outcomes for customers, 2) GE’s businesses, 3) Cash flow, and 4) Creating a culture of ac-
                                   countability. When discussing creating outcomes for customers, GE is not simply referring to
                                   the total number of jet engines or CAT scanners it manufactures, rather how the firm’s actions
                                   impact the lives of customers in addressing their needs. For example, GE also considers out-
                                   comes to be: providing cleaner energy, better diagnoses of diseases, or simply being there for
                                   customers when nobody else is. One of GE’s largest customers, American Airlines, through their
                                   CEO Robert Isom routinely thanks GE and says “American Airlines depends on a strong GE.”
                                   Using data analytics, GE produces a turboprop engine that has 10 percent more power than rival
                                   products with 20 percent fuel efficiency. This is just one example of many in how GE is working
                                   to improve the lives of its customers while providing measurable outcomes other than simply
                                   raw number of products produced to gauge its success.
                                        GE’s CEO announced in the 2017 Annual Report that the firm is moving forward to focus on
                                   three key business segments: aviation, healthcare, and renewable energy, which account for the
                                   bulk of the firm’s revenues and profits aside from the power division, which is currently struggling;
                                   GE appears to be moving away from devoting resources to power generation. Earnings were down
                                   45 percent for power in 2017, and it appears GE is currently entering a retrenchment strategy with
                                   this division, as their CEO says “resetting and refocusing.” This objective will mainly be executed
                                   through cost-cutting and counting on improved developments in sub-Saharan Africa. To date, there
                                   are 600 million people living in sub-Saharan Africa without electricity.
                                        GE is heavily focused on cash management, which is another way GE is saying it wishes
                                   to cut costs and become more efficient. In 2017, GE cut costs of $1.7 billion and has a target
                                   to cut an additional $2 billion in 2018. GE’s cost-cutting measures currently include reduc-
                                   ing dividends, laying off employees, reducing overhead, reducing inventory, and attempting to
                                   cut costs on all products. In addition, senior executive bonuses are being tied more closely to
                                   performance.

                                   Buying and Selling Divisions
                                   Consistent with the company’s long history of buying and selling businesses, in 2015, GE
                                   Capital divested its transportation-finance unit to Canada’s Bank of Montreal. In 2016, Haier
                                   Group acquired GE’s appliance division for $5.4 billion. In 2017, GE received final approval
                                   to combine its GE Oil and Gas segment with Baker Hughes to create a separate publicly traded
                                   company controlled by GE.
                                        GE acquired several firms in 2017 including ServiceMax and LM Wind Power. In total,
                                   the two acquisitions cost GE $2.6 billion, but should improve GE’s cloud technology and wind
                                   turbine production. LM Wind Power was one of the largest wind turbine blade producers in the
                                   world. GE divested its water business for $3.1 billion and has an agreement to sell its Industrial
                                   Solutions business for $2.6 billion to ABB Group based in Zurich, Switzerland. Both the Water
                                   business and Industrial Solutions business were contained within GE Power. GE expects to sell
                                   its non-U.S. lighting business by mid-2018, subject to completing the paperwork and passing
                                   legal compliance with various local and national governments.

                                   Finance
                                   The year 2017 was a difficult year for GE financially, with revenues down 1 percent, but net
                                   income down significantly due to increased cost of goods sold and operating expenses. The
                                   firm was forced to cut its quarterly dividend substantially from $0.24 per share to $0.12 cents
                                   per share and lay off thousands of workers, but still paid $12.1 billion in dividends and stock
                                   buybacks. The firm did benefit greatly from tax reform with over a $3 billion tax credit. CEO
                                   Flannery has indicated over $20 billion of industrial assets will be divested moving forward,
                                   including substantially reducing the size of its poorest performing division, GE Capital, which
                                   alone lost over $6 billion in 2017.
                                        GE’s recent income statements and balance sheets are provided in Exhibit 2 and Exhibit 3,
                                   respectively. Note the declines in both revenues and net income. Note also the $13 billion
                                   increase in Goodwill on the 2017 balance sheet, indicating that the company is still paying argu-
                                   ably too much for its acquisitions.

                                   regard. CEO Flannery has indicated GE will scale back its Capital Division and Expand Aviation
                                   and Healthcare along with Renewable Energy which is viewed as the future.

                                   GE Power
                                   GE Power has a mission to provide affordable, reliable and sustainable energy to custom-
                                   ers around the world. Major products GE produces within this division include: gas & steam
                                   turbines, generators, high voltage equipment, engines, and digital solutions. As revealed in
                                   Exhibits 4 and 5, revenues from the Power segment in 2017 declined slightly, but profits de-
                                   clined significantly in 2017. GE maintains a 50 percent market share in the heavy-duty turbine
                                   market; however this same market is plagued by overcapacity and declining prices and is a de-
                                   clining industry overall. With lower profit margins down 7 percent in 2017 alone, orders down
                                   13 percent, and GE being such a substantial player in the turbine market, resources devoted to
                                   this division may be diverted to faster-growing areas such as renewable energy.
                                        GE Power is further plagued by lower upgrade demand (customers are simply happy with
                                   their current products), supply chain over capacity, and difficulty in customers obtaining financ-
                                   ing. The outlook for this industry looks bleak moving forward with a possible tactic of focusing
                                   on operational efficiencies and slowly moving capital resources to other divisions. The Power
                                   Division at GE can be in some cases considered a Cash Cow on a BCG Matrix as GE is clearly
                                   the market leader, but industry-wide revenues/profits are not attractive. GE’s Power revenues from
                                   the United States totaled $11.3 billion with revenues from international operations totaling 24.7
                                   billion, led by the Middle East and Africa region at $8.0 billion in revenue. In total, worldwide,
                                   about half of the division’s revenue was derived from equipment and half from services.

                                   GE Renewable Energy
                                   GE Renewable Energy provides the same mission as its Power Division except with focus on
                                   renewable energy sources. Key products are wind turbines and hydropower solutions. Profit
                                   margins are up 7 percent in 2017 with a backlog increase of 15 percent indicating GE is not ef-
                                   fectively meeting demand. Increased competition resulting in lower prices and improvements
                                   in quality may keep pressure on profit margins in this industry moving forward. Revenues from
                                   the United States totaled $4.8 billion with revenues from international operations totaling $5.4

               billion, led by the Americas region with $2.0 billion in revenue. Equipment accounted for 79
               percent of the division’s revenues with services accounting for the balance. Onshore wind ac-
               counted for 86 percent of the division’s revenues; offshore wind only accounted for 3 percent.
               Hydropower accounted for the remaining 11 percent of divisional revenues.

               GE Oil and Gas
               GE Oil and Gas appears to be a relic of the past. GE does not engage in drilling like a large oil
               company, instead, GE provides the digital solutions and equipment that help oil firms find and
               extract oil and gas products. Key products include: turbo-machinery, equipment, and digital
               solutions. The division’s stated mission is to provide these products across the oil and gas value
               chain. Interestingly, GE used the term value chain here, as it is probable GE is operating on the
               least profitable area of the value chain in this industry, an area with very poor profit margins.
               The division’s profit margins declined 1.3 percent in 2017, but studying Exhibits 4 and 5, it is
               clear to see substantial revenue with minuscule profits. Orders were up 56 percent in 2017 for
               the division, so GE as a whole is actually increasing its commitment to the poorest performing
               division from a profit margin perspective other than GE Capital.
                    GE revenues from the U.S. Oil and Gas segment totaled $4.4 billion with revenues from
               international operations totaling $12.8 billion led by the Middle East and Africa region at $4.8
               billion in revenue. In total, worldwide, about 40 percent of the division’s revenue was derived
               from equipment and half from services.

               GE Aviation
               If constructing a BCG Matrix, GE Aviation likely lands in the Quadrant labeled Stars, certainly
               if the BCG focused on the narrow industry GE operates within in both segments. GE’s Aviation
               Division in 2017 enjoyed a profit margin increase of 24 percent with orders and a backlog
               up 12 and 10 percent, respectively. The division is on a mission to design and manufacture
               advanced engines and systems for its customers. The bulk of profits in this division are derived
               from both commercial and military engines, but the division also produces aviation systems
               and other machinery needed to support flight. The demand for aircraft engines is expected to

                                   are increasingly able to afford air travel. Revenues from the United States totaled $10.8 billion
                                   with revenues from international operations totaling $16.6 billion led by the Europe region with
                                   $6.2 billion in revenue. Equipment accounted for 36 percent of the division’s revenues with ser-
                                   vices accounting for the balance. Commercial engines and services accounted for 73 percent of
                                   the division’s revenues with military and systems only accounting for 14 and 13 percent.

                                   GE Healthcare
                                   GE Healthcare is a booming business as evidenced by Exhibits 4 and 5. Profit margins were up
                                   18 percent in 2017 with orders and backlogs up 6 and 8 percent, respectively. The division is on
                                   a mission to create precision healthcare through delivering outcomes. Interesting use of the word
                                   “outcomes” in the division’s mission as CEO Flannery suggested the firm will start measuring
                                   itself on outcomes rather than simply how many products were produced or what the quarterly
                                   or yearly income was for a division. Recall that CEO Flannery became CEO of GE after head-
                                   ing up the Healthcare Division. Growth in emerging markets is huge for this division and in
                                   markets such as the United States and Europe; populations are aging everywhere. Revenues
                                   from the United States totaled $8.6 billion with revenues from international operations totaling
                                   $10.6 ­billion led by the Asia region with $4.9 billion in revenue. Equipment accounted for 62
                                   percent of the division’s revenues with services accounting for the balance.

                                   GE Transportation and Lighting
                                   GE Transportation and Lighting only account for about 5 percent of 2017 revenues. GE transpor-
                                   tation supplies the railroad, mining, and marine industry with engines, equipment, locomotives,
                                   and digital solutions. GE Lighting focuses on LED technology and creating smart lighting situ-
                                   ations for homes and businesses. Both transportation and lighting saw profit margins, revenues,
                                   and profits all decline in 2017, however, neither business is a major player in GE’s overall port-
                                   folio of products. Currently, the majority of GE’s non-U.S. lighting business is expected to be
                                   sold in 2018, which accounted for $500 million in sales in 2017 compared to $1.5 billion for U.S.
                                   lighting operations. GE Transportation revenues for the United States were $2.4 billion to $1.8
                                   billion for non-U.S.

                                   GE Capital
                                   GE Capital helps to finance customers’ orders, provides product support, and invests in markets
                                   with longer-term hopes of turning a profit. Currently, GE is drastically reducing its exposure to
                                   this division, which lost $6.8 billion in 2017. About $4.4 billion in revenues were derived from
                                   the United States and $4.7 billion derived from outside the United States in 2017.
                                        Exhibit 6 reveals the bulk of GE’s 2017 revenues are derived from outside the United
                                   States. One interesting fact not revealed in Exhibit 6 is revenues in every region increased in

               2017 except for the U.S. division, where revenues declined enough to create an overall de-
               cline of 1 percent companywide. GE did not provide detailed breakdowns on product data in
               various regions, but from a close examination of Exhibit 4, it is difficult to attribute any one
               division’s sales in the United States as the principal culprit. Further suggesting that across all
               product lines, U.S.-based revenues simply lagged international derived revenues.

               Competitors
               Caterpillar, Siemens, and United Technologies are the largest GE rivals corresponding to the
               three main GE divisions (power turbines, diagnostic devices, and jet engines, respectively).
               However, Emerson Electric Company (EMS) and Haier Group Corporation (headquartered in
               Qingdao, China) are also competitors.

               Siemens AG
               Headquartered in Berlin and Munich, Siemens is very similar to GE. Siemens is the largest
               industrial manufacturing company in Europe, but the company has branch offices around the
               world. Siemens’ principal segments are 1) Industry, Energy, Healthcare and 2) Infrastructure and
               Cities. Siemens is a major producer of medical diagnostics equipment; its medical healthcare
               division generates about 12 percent of the company’s total sales and is its second-most profitable
               unit after the industrial automation division. Siemens and its subsidiaries employ about 372,000
               people worldwide and reported global revenue of around €83 billion in 2017.
                    Siemens produces gas and steam turbines; generators; compressors; on- and offshore
               wind turbines; high-voltage transmission products; power transformers; high-voltage switch-
               ing products and systems; alternating and direct current transmission systems; medium-voltage
               components and systems; and power automation products. The company also produces all
               kinds of lighting products such as incandescent, halogen, compact fluorescent, fluorescent,
               high-intensity discharge and Xenon lamps; opto-electronic semiconductor light sources such as
               light emitting diodes (LEDs), organic LEDs, high power laser diodes, LED systems and LED
               luminaires; electronic equipment including electronic ballasts; lighting control and management
               systems; and related precision components.
                    Siemens produces all kinds of medical products such as clinical information technology
               systems; hearing instruments; in-vitro diagnostics equipment; imaging equipment including an-
               giography, computed tomography, fluoroscopy, magnetic resonance, mammography, molecular
               imaging ultrasound, and x-ray equipment; and radiation oncology and particle therapy equip-
               ment. The company also produces transportation and logistics-related products such as equip-
               ment and systems for rail transportation including rail vehicles for mass transit, regional and
               long-distance transportation, locomotives, equipment and systems for rail electrification, central
               control systems, and automated train controls.

               Emerson Electric Company (EMS)
               Headquartered in St. Louis, Missouri, Emerson Electric is a technology and engineering com-
               pany that produces parts and products for the industrial, commercial, and residential markets
               worldwide. The company’s Automation Solutions segment most closely competes with GE.
               Emerson offers software; measurement and analytical instrumentation; valves, actuators, and
               regulators; industry services and solutions; process control systems and solutions; and digital
               plant solutions. Emerson serves oil and gas, refining, chemicals, power generation, pharmaceu-
               ticals, food and beverages, automotive, pulp and paper, metal and mining, and municipal water
               supplies markets.

               Caterpillar, Inc. (CAT)
               Headquartered in Deerfield, Illinois, Caterpillar manufactures and sells diesel and natural gas
               engines, industrial gas turbines, and diesel-electric locomotives for construction, resource,
               and energy and transportation industries. Many of these items compete with GE products.
               Caterpillar’s Energy & Transportation segment produces and markets reciprocating engine pow-
               ered generator sets; reciprocating engines; integrated systems used in the electric power genera-
               tion industry; turbines, centrifugal gas compressors, and related services; integrated systems and
               solutions for the marine and oil and gas industries; remanufactured reciprocating engines and

                                   directly with GE.

                                   Haier Group Corporation
                                   In 2016, GE sold its appliances business to Haier Group Corporation of China for $5.4 billion in
                                   cash. The GE divestiture included the stake of 48.4 percent that GE Appliances owned in Mabe,
                                   a Mexican appliances company. Qingdao Hai'er, a Chinese appliances company, had revenues of
                                   about $33 billion prior to acquiring GE Appliance. GE, however, even through 2018, continues
                                   to use the GE Appliances brand, and the unit’s headquarters remains in Louisville, Kentucky.
                                   Since the divestiture, Haier and GE have engaged in joint collaboration on many fronts, includ-
                                   ing healthcare and advanced manufacturing. In addition, since the acquisition, GE products have
                                   been distributed through Qingdao Hai'er in China. At the time of the acquisition, GE Appliances
                                   had revenue of about $6 billion and employed about 12,000 people.

                                   United Technologies Corporation (UTX)
                                   Headquartered in Farmington, Connecticut, United Technologies owns Pratt & Whitney (P&W)
                                   that competes directly with GE. P&W manufactures aircraft engines for commercial, military,
                                   business jet, and general aviation markets, and provides aftermarket maintenance, repair, and
                                   overhaul, as well as fleet management services—just like GE. In addition to P&W, United
                                   Technologies has an Aerospace Systems segment that provides electric power generation, power
                                   management, and distribution systems, as well as numerous air data and aircraft sensing sys-
                                   tems, engine control, intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance systems.
                                        Exhibit 7 provides a comparison of GE, Emerson Electric, and Caterpillar in 2018. Note
                                   that GE is substantially larger than Caterpillar and Emerson, but GE is unprofitable whereas the
                                   rival firms are doing quite well.

                                   External Issues
                                   Medical Devices
                                   The medical devices industry had revenues in 2017 of $340 billion, with growth around
                                   5 percent. One key advantage to doing business in this field is the aging population around
                                   the world and an increasing birthrate in the developing world. GE produces an array of ir-
                                   radiation devices, or diagnostic imaging devices, including CAT scanner, X-rays, beta-rays,
                                   and more. GE is the largest player in the irradiation device market with around 20 percent
                                   market share in the United States, followed by Siemens AG and Phillips Healthcare with
                                   10 and 7 percent market shares. Globally, Siemens has 20 percent more revenues than GE
                                   in diagnostic imaging sales and GE has 15 percent higher sales than Phillips. Globally, GE
                                   ranks eighth based on revenues in all devices under the medical devices umbrella, in which
                                   the industry is estimated to have sales over $340 billion. Estimating sales is difficult though

               because estimates may include hospital beds made by Stryker in some estimates, but other
               estimates may categorize hospital beds as something different than medical devices, which
               are generally thought of as MRI’s CAT scans, X-rays, and other devices discussed earlier. Of
               the various categories of medical devices in the industry, diagnostic imaging or irradiation
               devices are third in global sales behind both vitro diagnostics and cardiology. Growth rates
               are forecasted around 3.3 percent for diagnostic imaging devices but growth near 6 percent
               are forecasted for the two former areas of medical devices. GE is not a major player in either
               of these areas.
                    While the U.S. market is the world’s largest and most profitable on virtually everything
               medical, China, India, Latin America, and the Middle East are increasingly providing opportu-
               nities. Asia, in particular, has almost an epidemic, according to some medical experts, with an
               increasing number of smokers and an increased desire for fast food—accounting for 60 percent
               of cardiovascular deaths worldwide.

               Engines and Turbines
               Engines and turbines account for over $50 billion in annual industry sales in the United States,
               but growth is expected to continue to be flat moving forward. Most of the big players in this
               industry produce giant diesel engines, such as Caterpillar and Cummings, and these engines
               account for nearly 30 percent of the sales. Caterpillar and Cummings both operate in turbine
               power generation, and the largest portion of revenues, at 32 percent, are generated from turbines
               and turbine-related products. GE’s power division is most closely related to this industry, and to
               a lesser extent, GE’s renewable division only because renewables currently do not count for a
               large portion of either GE’s or the power generating industries revenues. Gas-powered turbines
               still dominate the industry with wind-powered turbines contributing practically nothing to over-
               all industry revenues. Overall, power production has been a poor revenue-generating industry
               with flat growth expected.

               Aviation
               The aviation industry in the United States accounts for over $230 billion in annual revenues, with
               half of that revenue going to exports. Growth has been 4 percent but is expected to decline to 1 per-
               cent annually, moving from 2018 to 2023. The industry includes both aircraft builders and engine
               builders, with GE being the market leader on aircraft engine production. The industry has benefited
               from an improving U.S. economy and a growing middle class abroad in emerging markets. In total,
               around 60 percent of industry profits are derived from aircraft construction, while the other 40 per-
               cent is split evenly between engines and miscellaneous aircraft parts.
                      GE’s largest aircraft engine competitor is Pratt &Whitney owned by United Technologies
               Corporation. Pratt & Whitney produces engines for commercial, military, and business. Rolls-
               Royce is also a player in the jet engine business, being about the same size as Pratt & Whitney,
               with both firms’ combined revenues from jet engines being about the same as GE’s. Both firms
               have larger revenues in the defense industry as a whole than GE. The three firms operate what
               some consider an oligopoly in the industry. However, Boeing, Airbus, and other airline custom-
               ers do have bargaining power over the engine producers, so much so that engine manufacturers
               will even take a loss on the sale of engines to ensure long-term parts, repairs, and maintenance
               business.
                      GE also competes to a lesser extent with Boeing, Lockheed Martin, and many others
               on various aviation services—mostly in the defense-related business, where GE only ranks
               ­twenty-fourth globally. Military spending is increasing both domestically and globally with
                China, India, and Russia leading the way.
                      There has been significant and growing demand for passenger airlines over the last
                ­several years. Boeing has routinely had around 5,700 aircraft on backorder, annually, while
                 over the same timeframe, Airbus has routinely had around 6,700 aircraft on backorder. With
                 this strong demand, both airline producers are continuing to increase production. This is
                 great news for firms like GE who produce the engines used on commercial aircraft. Two
                 aircraft areas that are not performing as well are the jumbo jets and business jets. Engine
                 suppliers are somewhat dependent on the airline manufacturers meeting demand in a timely
                 manner. GE can be as efficient as possible on producing jet engines, but if the planes are not
                 ready, GE suffers.

                                   Global Trade Trends
                                   There is an increased concern among corporations and nations over the rise in protectionism
                                   and nationalism. New fears of restrictions in global trade have made some business leaders such
                                   as GE’s CEO uneasy. GE, for example, sells 60 percent of what they make abroad and would
                                   be hampered by new tariffs, reductions to NAFTA and even trade tensions between the United
                                   States and China. The United States recently imposed tariffs on steel and aluminum imports.
                                   According to GE’s Global Innovation Barometer, 55 percent of executives around the world,
                                   ironically, indicate they believe further protectionist policies would be beneficial for their busi-
                                   ness operations. Global trade trends are, however, an issue to be mindful of going forward.

                                   While the world is significantly more developed than ever before, many people around the world
                                   still lack the basic necessities that many take for granted. Over 600 million people, for example,
                                   in sub-Saharan Africa, lack electricity, and in total, 1.5 billion people across the world, or about
                                   20 percent of the world’s population still lack basic healthcare, electricity, or modern transpor-
                                   tation. Many countries around the world are adding new infrastructure, including the United
                                   States; China, for example estimates that by 2020 it will need 3 million additional hospital beds.
                                   Southeast Asia’s infrastructure spending is increasing by $180 billion each year.

                                   Barriers to Entry
                                   A positive factor for GE going forward is that barriers to entry in both its healthcare and jet en-
                                   gine production are abnormally high. Several key reasons are both industries require high R&D
                                   expenditures along with legal and regulatory hurdles to jump. Smaller firms, even if they were
                                   able to produce viable products, would have to compete with the relatively few giant firms that
                                   produce these devices after extensive negotiations with potential customers. Medical devices
                                   also come with heavy patent protection and even if patents have expired, it is difficult to get doc-
                                   tors and hospitals to switch to products produced by a lesser-known firm if the products are not
                                   exceptionally better or less expensive upfront to operate. Product liability insurance for medical
                                   device manufacturers is higher than in other industries. The high barriers to entry in both indus-
                                   tries offer some protection for legacy firms such as GE.

                                   Future
                                   In March 2018, GE Renewable Energy revealed plans to develop the largest, most powerful
                                   offshore wind turbine on the planet: the Haliade-X. This turbine features a 12 MW direct drive
                                   generator and an industry-leading gross capacity factor of 63 percent. The Haliade-X will pro-
                                   duce 45 percent more energy than any other offshore turbine available today. GE is investing
                                   more than $400 million in 2018 to 2022 to develop and deploy the Haliade, which will tower 260
                                   meters over the sea, more than five times the size of the iconic Arc de Triomphe in Paris, France.
                                   The new Haliade-X 12 MW will house a 220-meter rotor designed and manufactured by GE’s
                                   LM Wind Power; the 107-meter-long blades will be the longest offshore blades in the industry.
                                   One Haliade-X 12 MW turbine will generate up to 67 GWh annually, enough clean power for
                                   up to 16,000 households per turbine, and up to 1 million European households in a 750 MW
                                   ­wind-farm configuration.
                                         Between 2018 and 2020, GE plans to sell its 62.5 percent stake in Baker Hughes to
                                    strengthen its balance sheet and simplify operations. In July 2017, General Electric had acquired
                                    Baker Hughes and merged the affiliate with its oil and gas equipment and services businesses.
                                    However, share prices of both the companies plunged after the acquisition and Baker Hughes
                                    has lost 39.2 percent of its value in the twelve months following the acquisition.
                                         GE needs a clear strategic plan to guide its path forward to reverse negative profitability.
                                    Shareholders, customers, employees, and creditors all expect GE top management to lead the
                                    way to a bright future.

               Barwa Group—2022

               barwa.com.qa
               Headquartered in Doha, Qatar, the Barwa Group (Barwa), provides real-estate develop-
               ment, construction, and related financial services throughout the Middle East. With about
               200 employees, the company builds residential housing, apartment complexes, condomini-
               ums, supermarkets, mosques, shopping centers, and tourist centers. Projects completed since
               2012 include properties at Mesaleed, Mesaimeer, Barwa Al Baraha, Madinat Al Mawater, and
               Barwa Village.
                   At year-end 2020, Barwa’s real-estate portfolio consisted of 8,148 residential apartments;
               336,552 square meters of shops, showrooms, and office space; 445,779 square meters of warehouses;
               and 701 hotel rooms. The average occupancy rate for Barwa properties exceeds 90 percent, so the
               company is doing quite well. In fact, 81.5 percent of the company’s revenue is generated from rental
               properties, 96.7 percent of the company’s operating profit is generated through recurring rental, and
               the company has a low debt-to-equity ratio of 1:2.
                   A key part of Barwa’s strategic plan for 2021 and beyond is to strengthen its partnership with
               the government of Qatar, which successfully bid for the 2022 FIFA World Cup, making it the first
               Muslim and Arab country to host the World Cup. This event is spurring real-estate development
               in Qatar, which is a further positive for Barwa. Qatar is also set to host the 2030 Asian Games.
                   Qatar is a country of 3 million people located in the Middle East, on a peninsula in the
               Persian Gulf. Qatar is known for its beautiful beaches, the Corniche waterfront promenade, the
               capital city of Doha, and ultramodern architecture. Qatar’s neighbor to the south is Saudi Arabia;
               the island country of Bahrain is to Qatar’s northeast. A very wealthy country due to its huge oil
               reserves, Qatar is basically surrounded by water in the Gulf of Bahrain. The world-renowned Al
               Jazeera Media Network is based in this country. The overwhelming majority of the country’s
               residents are expatriates, with migrant laborers making up a significant percentage, hence the
               Barwa Al Baraha project in the next section.

               History
               Barwa was founded in 2005 and is today listed on the Qatar Stock Exchange with the ticker sym-
               bol BRES. In 2009, the company began building 1,000 residential housing units in Mesaimeer
               along with a supermarket, nursery, and mosque. In 2010, the company completed is Barwa Al
               Baraha project, a city designed for laborers, in the Al Wakrah area. In 2017, Barwa began build-
               ing its Madinat Al Mawater project, designed to include hundreds of apartments as well as used-
               car lots, shops, and warehouses. Today, Barwa is Qatar’s largest real-estate development and
               managing company.

               Vision/Mission
               Barwa strives to help implement the Qatar National Vision 2030 sponsored by His Highness
               Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani, the Emir of Qatar. His family has ruled Qatar for two
               centuries.
                   In Barwa’s vision statement, featured on the corporate website, the focus is on reliability,
               values, and sustainability, centered on its stakeholders.
                   Barwa’s mission statement is a simple proposition of developing superior home, office, and
               entertainment spaces with efficiency. The vision and mission statements can be viewed on the
               company’s website: www.barwa.com.qa/en.

                                   Internal Issues
                                   Key Projects
                                   In their mid-year 2021 report, Barwa reported that work continues on several new projects,
                                   including the following:
                                    1. The third phase of the Mawater City Project, which began in August 2019 on 418,000
                                       square meters of land, includes 118 galleries, a hypermarket, car service centers, a car parts
                                       center, and a showroom for an automobile agency. This phase is an extension of Phases 1
                                       and 2 of the project.
                                    2. The Qatar Schools Project Development Agreement, implemented by Qatar’s Public-
                                       Private Partnership system, is expected to complete in May 2022 and service 6,000
                                       students, with Barwa receiving guaranteed rental income for a period of 25 years.
                                    3. Construction work continues on Madinatna, within the city of Al-Wakra, which is
                                       intended as a residential city for families, and in Baraha Al Janoub, which is a workers’
                                       city. Development work on the two projects is expected to be completed in April 2022.
                                       Madinatna has capacity for accommodate 6,780 residential apartments that can house
                                       a total of 27,000 people. Barahat Al Janoub is to consist of 1,404 apartments and can
                                       accommodate 67,360 workers.
                                    4. In 2020, Barwa started selling residential units of the Dara (A) project in Lusail City,
                                       consisting of 4 five-floor residential buildings that each comprise 271 apartments.
                                    5. The Mukaynis Compound residential city project consists of 3,170 residential villas that
                                       can accommodate more than 100,000 workers.
                                    6. Phase 2 of the Al Khor workers sports complex has 516 apartments, a hypermarket, and a
                                       multi-purpose hall.

                                   Segments
                                   Barwa operates under four broad segment categories: 1) real estate developments in Qatar, 2)
                                   international real estate, 3) business services, and 4) infrastructure services. However, the Barwa
                                   2020 Annual Report discusses the company’s segments in terms of 9 categories: 1) Residential,
                                   2) Mixed Use & Commercial, 3) Industrial, 4) Worker Accommodation, 5) PPP Development
                                   Program, 6) Land Bank, 7) International Real Estate Investments, 8) Independent Subsidiaries,
                                   and 9) International Associate Companies.
                                       The Residential segment includes Madinatna, Dukhan City Project, Alaqaria Tower, and
                                   Alaqaria Projects Mesaieed. The Mixed Use & Commercial segment includes Barwa Village,
                                   Madinat Mawater, and Barwa Al Sadd. The Industrial segment includes Umm Shahrain
                                   Warehouses (38 retail shops, 13 electrical substations, roads, and firefighting systems) and
                                   Al Baraha Workshops & Storage. The Workers Accommodation category includes Workers
                                   Accommodation in Barwa Al Baraha, Mukaynis Compound, Al Khor Workers Sports Complex,
                                   and Barahat al Janoub. “Public–Private Partnership” (PPP) Development includes the Qatar
                                   Schools operations. Land Bank includes Lusail Land and Phase 3 of Barwa Al Baraha, Phase
                                   3 of Barwa City, Phase 2 of the Dara project, and Barwa Al Doha. International Real Estate
                                   Investments include North Row and Cavendish Property in London, Marrakesh Project and
                                   Fez Project in Morocco, Larnaca Land in Cyprus, Bahrain Bay Project in Bahrain, and Riyadh
                                   Land Plot in Riyadh. Independent Subsidiaries include Waseef and Qatar Project Management.
                                   International Associate Companies include Nuzul Holdings in Bahrain and Shaza Hotels
                                   Company in Saudi Arabia, Oman, and the United Arab Emirates.
                                       As indicated in Exhibit 1, Barwa uses neither of the above-mentioned potential segment
                                   breakdowns when providing financial data to the public. Exhibit 1 provides revenue and profit
                                   information for Barwa by segment, but note that the segments are broad categories rather than
                                   specific projects, products, locations, cities, or regions. If the company has more revealing seg-
                                   ment data, and it quite assuredly does, it does not make such information available to the public.

                                   Organizational Structure
                                   Barwa has various segments described in nebulous ways on its corporate website and in its 2020
                                   Annual Report, and no organizational chart or clear specification of top executive responsibilities
                                   is given in either place. Based on what is provided, however, the company apparently operates

               utilizing a functional (centralized) organizational design, because there are no divisional head
               persons listed by title or otherwise, either on the corporate website or in the company’s 2020
               Annual Report.
                    Based on all the segment information provided above, albeit disjointedly in the company’s
               disclosures, Barwa is clearly a projects-oriented company, being a construction firm with various
               ongoing projects either in the construction phase or completed and managed. Historically, of all
               the types of organizational structure, a matrix-type design is generally the most effective and ef-
               ficient for this type of firm.
                    Let us examine how Barwa is currently organized. Exhibit 2 provides a list and array of
               Barwa’s top executives. Note that there are no top executives specified for the company’s various
               projects, products, regions, or otherwise, thus indicating a very centralized operation. Executive
               titles do not align with company segments, which is a problem for the firm.

               In August 2021, Barwa released its financial results for the 6-month period ending June 30,
               2021, revealing a net profit of QR 533 million, total assets of QR 35 billion, and total equity of
               over QR 20 billion. In the interim report, Barwa presented a 41 percent increase in rental income,
               accompanied by a 34 percent decrease in general and administrative expenses.
                   Barwa’s recent fiscal year-end 2019 and 2020 financial statements are provided in Exhibits 3
               and 4. Note the 8 percent drop in revenues and 19 percent drop in net income in 2020; the com-
               pany says that COVID-19 was the root cause.

               Strategy
               Barwa is currently studying the economic feasibility of many development projects put forward
               by the Public Works Authority under Qatar’s Public-Private Partnership system. Additionally,
               Barwa is studying its available space to determine optimal use, as the company owns large land
               holdings spread over various locations, including large plots in Lusail and other strategic sites
               in Qatar. Barwa says they strive to meet and exceed the needs of the Qatar real-estate market
               consistent with Qatar’s National Vision 2030 and the company’s desire for sustainable growth.

               External Issues
               Qatar is preparing for the FIFA 2022 World Cup by launching numerous large-scale infrastructure
               construction projects, including stadiums and other sporting facilities and significant investments
               in the expansion of the country’s road, seaport, airplane, and rail networks. In fact, the Qatari con-
               struction market is expected to register a CAGR of 9.6 percent over the period 2019–2024, making
               it one of the fastest-growing global construction markets in the world. The Qatar National Vision
               2030 is also spurring tremendous growth in the country, and Barwa is well-positioned to capitalize
               on this national mandate. In Lusail City, the 80,000-seat Lusail Stadium will host the opening and
               closing ceremonies for the 2022 FIFA World Cup. The stadium is nearing completion, and the city is
               home to a dozen hotels and more than 200,000 permanent residents. Also nearing completion is the
               Hamad International Airport Phase 1 expansion, intended to increase annual capacity to 53 million
               passengers by 2022, with Phase 2 increasing that still further to 60 million passengers by 2024.

               Qatar
               Qatar has the third-highest GDP per capita in the world and is classified as a World Bank high-
               income economy. Although small, the country has the world’s third-largest natural gas and oil
               reserves. The country is an absolute monarchy ruled by the House of Thani, or the Al Thani
               family, since 1868; today, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani holds all executive and legislative
               power and appoints both the prime minister and cabinet. Some 5-star luxury hotels in Qatar are
               allowed to sell alcohol to their non-Muslim customers. Qatar hosts the Al Udeid Air Base, where
               the United States and the United Kingdom hold strategic military operations.

               Tourism
               Summertime is the slowest tourist season for Qatar, so the government instituted a “Summer in
               Qatar” initiative to increase tourism during the summer, especially between Eid al-Fitr and Eid
               al-Adha. The country of Qatar has also introduced policies and laws to boost overall tourism,
               such as the introduction of visa-free travel from 80 countries. The demand for hotel rooms is out-
               pacing supply in Qatar, which is to Barwa’s advantage. Exhibit 6 provides information regarding
               the hotel room supply in Qatar. Exhibit 7 provides information regarding the source of Qatar’s
               tourists and visitors.

                                   Economy
                                   Qatar is instituting reforms aimed at spurring economic development nationwide. QR 19.2 billion,
                                   9.3 percent of the government’s total budget, has been allocated to develop the education sector,
                                   which includes QR 6.8 billion for the construction of new schools within 5 years. Another QR
                                   22.7 billion, or 11 percent of the total budget, is devoted to improving the country’s healthcare
                                   sector, which includes the construction of 5 new health centers. Barwa has positioned itself to
                                   take advantage of the government’s focus and expenditures on economic development. The gov-
                                   ernment of Qatar in March 2019 increased the number of freehold zones from 3 to 10 in Lusail,
                                   West Bay, and the Onaiza region. In addition, foreign investors now can hold full ownership in
                                   Qatar’s residential and commercial sectors, opening up new opportunities for Barwa to build
                                   more residential units under a built-to-sell (BTS) model.

                    The unemployment rate in Qatar is less than 1 percent, and no one lives below the poverty
               line. There are no taxes except on tobacco products and some junk foods. Qatar is an affluent
               country endowed with huge petroleum reserves and large refineries, all based in Umm Said.
               Qatar’s main seaport is Hamad Port, and this area is growing fast, but the country’s Ras Laffan
               Port on the northern coast exports more liquid natural gas (LNG) than any other facility in the
               world by a significant measure. Qatar Airways is one of the largest airlines in the world, and it
               often wins global best Airline of the Year awards. Qatar has the lowest illiteracy rate, about 3
               percent for males and 4 percent for females, in the Arab-speaking world; the country also has an
               excellent RAND Corporation developed K-12 education system.
                    Qatar’s residential real-estate market is growing by about 13 percent annually, boosted
               no doubt by the many people moving to the country. In 2021 alone, pending relief from
               COVID-19, about 8,200 new residential units were expected to become available in Qatar,
               especially in Lusail, The Pearl-Qatar, and in West Bay. About 530 new units were added in
               the country in Q4 2020, bringing the total residential stock to 303,015. The residential real-
               estate market in Qatar includes 1) condominiums, 2) villas, and 3) “other,” with the primary
               cities being Doha, Al Wakrah, Al Rayyan, and Umm Salal Muhammad.
                    The Qatar Free Zones Authority is attracting increasing investments from around the world,
               such as France’s Gaussin Advance Mobility Company and Qatar-based Al Attiya Motors, which
               recently opened the country’s first assembly plant of electric vehicles at Ras Bu Fontas. Microsoft
               is now building a public cloud data center in Qatar, and Google is building a Google Cloud facil-
               ity in Doha.

               Competitors
               Foreign firms are increasingly entering Qatar’s residential real estate market, especially in West
               Bay Lagoon and The Pearl, but it has domestic rivals such as United Development Company and
               Al Mana Real Estate. However, the four major rivals to Barwa are AREDC, Ezdan, Msheireb,
               and Qatari Diar, as indicated below.

               Al Asmakh Real Estate Development Company
               The ISO-accredited Al Asmakh Real Estate Development Company (AREDC) is the top real-es-
               tate company in Qatar. AREDC has been on the market for more than 30 years and is involved in
               property management, leasing and selling, development and acquisition, consultancy, and asset
               management. ARECD manages properties all over Qatar, especially in Doha. AREDC’s diverse
               portfolio consists of apartments, high-rise towers, compounds, villas, labor accommodations,
               commercial offices, and warehouses. Particularly renowned projects by AREDC include the Les
               Maisons Blanches compound in Lusail and the Paramount Residences at the Pearl Qatar, which
               consists of 196 luxurious properties.

               Ezdan Holding Group
               Ezdan is one of the largest real estate companies in the wider Persian Gulf region, with more than
               29,000 real estate units in Doha, Al Wakrah, and other areas. Headquartered in Doha, Ezdan has
               10,000 employees and is headed by CEO Ali Mohammed Al Obaidli. Notable major projects by
               Ezdan include The Curve, the Ezdan Palace, Ezdan Mall, and Ezdan Hotels. Ezdan’s reported
               rental revenue of QR 1.177 billion in 2020 is down from QR 1.267 billion in 2019, and profits of
               QR 1.088 billion in 2020 are down from QR 1.305 billion the prior year. Ezdan develops, con-
               structs, owns, rents, leases, and manages both residential and commercial properties, including
               apartments, hotels, restaurants, shopping malls, and commercial centers, mainly in Qatar but also
               as far away as Ethiopia.

               Msheireb Properties Company
               Established primarily to enable Qatar to achieve the country’s 2030 Vision, Msheireb is a subsid-
               iary of the Qatar Foundation. Msheireb has achieved ISO certification from the British Standards
               Institution for quality (ISO 9001:2015), environmental performance (ISO 14001:2015), occu-
               pational health and safety (BS OHSAS 18001:2007), and Risk Management Standards (ISO
               31000:2009). Msheireb Downtown Doha is the company’s prime example project for what it is
               doing to spur tourism and development in Qatar through 2030.

                                   Qatari Diar Real Estate Company
                                   Established in 2005 by the Qatar Investment Authority, the sovereign wealth fund of the State of
                                   Qatar, Qatari Diar is headquartered in Doha and has projects now spanning the globe, including
                                   in Washington DC, London, Dushanbe, and Tajikistan. The company’s flagship project is Lusail
                                   City, which launched in December 2005 and is still being added onto and modernized, consistent
                                   with the company’s primary mission to help Qatar fulfill its 2030 vision. In mid-2021, Qatari
                                   Diar had a shared capital of $8 billion, 50 investment projects under development in 22 countries,
                                   and a combined investment value of about $35 billion.​

                                   Conclusion
                                   As indicated in the case, foreign firms are increasingly entering Qatar’s residential and commer-
                                   cial real-estate market, and domestic rival firms such as United Development Company, Al Mana
                                   Real Estate, AREDC, Ezdan, Msheireb, and Qatari Diar are gaining momentum. Moreover, no
                                   top executives are specified for Barwa’s various projects, products, regions, or otherwise, indi-
                                   cating a very centralized operation. Executive titles do not align with company segments, which
                                   is a problem for the firm. Despite a prosperous country and a growing economy, CEO Abdullah
                                   Bin Jubara Al-Rumaihi needs assistance reorganizing Barwa and developing a clear strategic
                                   plan for the future.
                                       Given your expertise and based on what you have read in this book, prepare a comprehensive
                                   strategic plan for Mr. Al-Rumaihi. The CEO will appreciate your work because both local and
                                   global rivals are gaining market share and confidence. He needs a clear new vision and mission
                                   statement, a new research-based SWOT and BCG analysis, and projected financial statements to
                                   reveal the expected impact of your proposed strategic plan.
                                       Profit margins in every industry become slimmer as competitiveness increases. Barwa’s
                                   shareholders could defect unless some important strategy decisions are made to more effectively
                                   allocate resources across products, services, and regions in the area. Provide a 3-year roadmap to
                                   success for Mr. Al-Rumaihi to share with his top corporate comrades.

               Starbucks Corporation—2018

               http://www.starbucks.com; SBUX
               Headquartered in Seattle, Washington, and the world’s largest coffee company, Starbucks is a
               premier roaster, marketer, and retailer of specialty coffee in the world, with over 24,000 stores in
               76 countries. The company provides customers with the “Starbucks Experience”—comprised of
               excellent customer service, clean stores, appropriate music, and a comfortable setting. Currently,
               Starbucks in the United States segment generates about 69 percent of total revenues. Millions
               of people every day meet at Starbucks to talk, do business, and chat with friends. The music
               selected to play in the stores enhances the relaxed look and feel of the coffeehouse. Starbucks of-
               fers a full coffeehouse experience, complete with premium teas, fine pastries, and other sweets.
               The company also sells a variety of coffee and tea products through licensed stores, grocery
               stores, and foodservice accounts. Several brands associated with Starbucks are Teavana, Tazo,
               Seattle’s Best Coffee, Evolution Fresh, La Boulange, and Ethos.
                    In February 2018, Starbucks and JP Morgan Chase began offering the Starbucks Rewards
               Visa Card, a co-brand credit card integrated directly into the Starbucks Reward loyalty program.
               Customers using this Visa card earn Stars with every purchase, both in and out of Starbucks
               stores, and can redeem their Stars for food and beverage items at more than 8,000 participating
               Starbucks locations. Cardholders also become members of the Starbucks Rewards loyalty pro-
               gram comprised of more than 14 million members. Later in 2018, Starbucks and Chase plan to
               offer a second co-branded product, the Starbucks Rewards Visa Prepaid Card.
                    Starbucks’ strategic plan is to add about 600 new stores annually in China during 2018–
               2022, adding stores in 100 new cities to reach 230 cities across the country. The company plan is
               to more than triple revenue and more than double operating income in China between 2017 and
               2022. This plan calls for the company to double the number of Starbucks stores in China from
               the end of FY2017 to 6,000.
                    Starbucks’ fiscal year ends on September 30. For the company’s fiscal Q1 2018 that ended
               December 31, 2017, revenues increased 6 percent to a record $6 billion, with comparable store
               sales up 2 percent. For that Q1, company’s revenues from stores in China increased 30 percent,
               with comparable store sales up 6 percent. Starbucks as a whole is performing really well.

               History
               Starbucks was founded in Seattle in 1971 as a roaster and retailer of whole bean and ground
               coffee, teas, and spices in a single store in Seattle’s Pike Place Market. The company was named
               after the first mate in Herman Melville’s Moby Dick. The Starbuck logo was inspired by the sea
               and features a twin-tailed siren from Greek mythology. The company was incorporated in 1985
               and went public in 1992.
                    In November 2017, the company opened its first store in Jamaica and entered its seventy-
               sixth market globally. Together with its local business partner, Baristas del Caribe, LLC,
               Starbucks opened its first store in Puerto Rico.
                    In December 2017, Starbucks completed the sale of its Tazo Tea brand to Unilever; Starbucks
               desires to focus on a single tea brand, specifically its super premium tea brand, Teavana. Also
               that month, Starbucks was named fifth in Fortune’s World’s Most Admired Companies survey.
               Additionally, the company completed its acquisition of the remaining 50 percent share of its East
               China business from long-term joint venture partners, Uni-President (UPEC) and President Chain
               Store Corporation (PCSC). With this transaction, Starbucks assumed 100 percent ownership of
               over 1,400 Starbucks stores in Shanghai and in the Jiangsu and Zhejiang Provinces, bringing
               the total number of company-owned stores in China to over 3,100. On this same day, UPEC and
               PCSC acquired Starbucks 50 percent interest in President Starbucks Coffee Taiwan Limited and
               assumed 100 percent ownership of Starbucks operations in Taiwan.

    624    STRATEGIC-MANAGEMENT CASE ANALYSIS

                                                 On December 5, 2017, Starbucks opened its Reserve Roastery in Shanghai, China, now the
                                            largest Starbucks store in the world. The Roastery features onsite baking by Italian food pur-
                                            veyor Rocco Princi, for the first time ever in China, and features onsite roasting and brewing of
                                            Starbucks Reserve coffees.
                                                 In April 2018, Starbucks opened its first store in Uruguay, the city of Montevideo. The new
                                            store offers Starbucks 100 percent Arabica coffees from Latin America and around the world.
                                            International retail and restaurant operator Alsea exclusively owns and operates Starbucks stores
                                            in the country. Starbucks plans to open 10 stores and create 130 new jobs in Uruguay by 2020.

                                            Organizational Structure
                                            As indicated in Exhibit 1, Starbucks operates from using a strategic business unit (SBU) type of
                                            organization with numerous regional Presidents reporting to four CEOs and four COOs in the
                                            company. An illustration of the Starbucks organizational structure is depicted in Exhibit 1. Probably
                                            no one but Starbucks insiders know exactly who reports to who—but what is important for students
                                            is to devise a recommended reporting relationship, perhaps deleting some positions and creating
                                            others, to more clearly reveal for all insiders and outsiders the Starbucks chain of command.

                                            Starbucks’ vision statement is “To establish Starbucks as the premier purveyor of the finest cof-
                                            fee in the world while maintaining uncompromising principles while we grow.”
                                                 Starbucks’ mission statement blends a grand and uplifting goal—nourish the human spirit—
                                            with a message about how it delivers this—by catering to its individual customers and commu-
                                            nities. The vision can be viewed on the company’s website, in the “About Us” section: https://

                                            Starbucks is divided into four major operating segments:
                                                1.   Americas, including the United States, Canada, and Latin America
                                                2.   China/Asia Pacific (CAP)
                                                3.   Europe, Middle East, and Africa (EMEA)
                                                4.   Channel Development

                    All segments are comprised of stores, except “Channel Development” that includes all the
               Starbucks beverages and other branded products sold throughout the world through “channels”
               such as grocery stores, warehouse clubs, specialty retailers, convenience stores, and food-
               service accounts. The company has a few non-reportable operating segments, such as Teavana
               retail stores and Seattle’s Best Coffee, and Siren Retail that offers taste testing operations. The
               non-reporting segments are simply classified as Other Segments in the company’s financial
               reports. For fiscal 2017, Starbucks’ revenues by segment as a percentage of total net revenues
               were as follows: Americas (70%), CAP (14%), EMEA (5%), Channel Development (9%), and
               All Other Segments (2%). Thus, the Americas is by far the dominant segment for Starbucks.
               The Americas, CAP, and EMEA segments include both company-operated and licensed stores.
                    In order to examine what Starbucks is doing currently, Exhibit 2 provides a summary of
               Starbucks operations across segments for Q1 2018. Notice that 700 new Starbucks stores were
               opened that quarter, but the company’s overall operating income declined 1 percent, primarily due
               to the 11 percent drop in operating profits in the EMEA segment. That segment is lagging the others
               in overall performance.
                    Starbucks provides in their financial documents a breakdown of revenue by type of store.
               Revenue from company-operated stores accounted for 57 percent of total net revenues during fiscal
               2017. Exhibit 3 reveals that there are slightly more licensed stores than company-owned stores be-
               cause outside of the Americas, Starbucks prefers to utilize licensed stores rather than owning stores.

                                        For Q2 2018 that ended 3-31-18, Starbucks reported that its same store sales increased
                                   2 percent both globally and in the United States, and were up 4 percent in China. The company’s
                                   revenues in Q2 increased 14 percent to a record $6 billion. Specifically for Q2, Starbucks’ rev-
                                   enues from company-owned stores increased 15.1 percent to $4.828 billion, while revenues from
                                   licensed stores increased 14.4 percent to $625.6 billion. In the company’s Americas and EMEA
                                   segments, the trend is to add licensed stores, but in the China/Asia segment, Starbucks is primar-
                                   ily adding company-owned stores.

                                   Finance
                                   During Q1 of fiscal 2018 that ended December 31, 2017, active membership in Starbucks
                                   Rewards in the United States grew 11 percent versus the prior year to 14.2 million, with mem-
                                   ber spending comprising 37 percent of U.S. company-operated sales, and Mobile Order and
                                   Pay representing another 11 percent of U.S. company-operated transactions. The Starbucks
                                   Card was used for 42 percent of U.S. and Canada company-operated transactions. During Q1
                                   2018, Starbucks opened 700 net new stores globally, bringing total store count to 28,039 across
                                   76 counties. Also, during Q1, the company returned a record $2 billion to shareholders
                                   through a combination of dividends and share repurchases. Specifically, Starbucks repurchased
                                   28.5 million shares of common stock in Q1; approximately 52 million shares remain available
                                   for purchase under current authorizations.

                                   Coffee Industry Overview
                                   Coffee is the most commonly consumed beverage worldwide. The coffee market can be seg-
                                   mented into growers, roasters, and retailers. On the coffee-growing level, South America was
                                   ranked as the major coffee-producing region. Brazil produced and exported 43.2 million 60-kg
                                   bags of coffee in 2016. Other major producers are Vietnam and Columbia. Exporting countries
                                   tend to consume less coffee than their importing counterparts.
                                        The United States has the largest market share with 45.8 percent of global retail coffee sales
                                   in 2016, followed by single-cup coffee. Starbucks and Dunkin' Donuts dominate out-of-home
                                   retail market, with a combined market share of over 65 percent. Growth in coffee cup per capita
                                   consumption is recently up 18 percent in China, 13 percent in the United Kingdom, and 3.5
                                   percent in Japan. Consumers drink, on average, 1.64 cups of coffee per day, reporting that they
                                   drink it at home, on the way to work, and at work. People drink coffee to wake up in the morning
                                   or receive a burst of energy throughout the day. People drink more and more coffee as they get
                                   older, with the over-60 age group drinking more coffee than any other group.

                    From 2012 through 2016, coffee retail sales in the United States grew at a compounded
               annual growth rate (CAGR) of 4.6 percent. During this period of time, there was, however, a
               shift from single-cup coffee brands that made up just 21 percent of dollar sales, to now ac-
               counting for 41 percent. This means that all other categories of coffee shrunk during those
               5 years. For example, instant coffee and whole beans were both down by 11 percent, while
               ground coffee declined 9 percent. However, the single-cup market has matured, and 2017
               reveals virtually zero growth. A study by the National Coffee Association (NCA) shows that
               household penetration of single-cup brewing machines in the United States has peaked at
               around 30 percent, after growing rapidly from just 9 percent in 2011. Fewer consumers today
               are shifting from drip coffee makers or from instant coffee to single-cup, resulting in slowing
               growth rates.
                    Prices of single-cup coffee have declined over recent years to a level of what they were
               10 years ago. Although retail sales are slowing, out-of-home channel sales of coffee are ac-
               celerating. U.S. foodservice coffee sales ended 2016 at around 3.3 percent higher than in
               2015. This upward trend in out-of-home purchases of coffee is partly due to low unemploy-
               ment and continued economic growth, both of which enable consumers to increase their cof-
               fee consumption out-of-home; this trend should continue in 2018–2019. Shifts in household
               composition are favoring the steady rise in out-of-home coffee sales. Additionally, more
               single households and fewer homes with underage children are reasons why fewer families

                                   Starbucks’ primary competitors for coffee beverage sales are specialty coffee shops and quick-
                                   service restaurants (QSRs). In almost all markets, there are hundreds of competitors in the spe-
                                   cialty coffee beverage business, but Dunkin' Brands and McDonald’s Corporation are the two
                                   major rivals to Starbucks. Exhibit 6 provides a market share breakdown of coffee market share
                                   across these companies. Note that Starbucks is in the lead, but not by much, and McDonald’s
                                   leads outside the United States.

                                   Dunkin' Brands Group (DNKN)
                                   Based in Canton, Massachusetts and founded in 1950, Dunkin' Brands is arguably America’s
                                   favorite all-day, everyday stop for coffee and baked goods—and is Starbucks’ major rival firm.
                                   The Dunkin' Donuts segment of the company is a market leader in the hot regular/decaf/flavored
                                   coffee, iced coffee, donut, bagel, and muffin categories. The company has earned the number-
                                   one ranking for customer loyalty in the coffee, donut, bagel, muffin, and breakfast sandwich
                                   categories by Brand Keys for 9 years running. Dunkin has more than 11,500 restaurants in 40
                                   countries worldwide. The other big segment of the company is Baskin Robbins. Actually the
                                   company operates through four segments: Dunkin' Donuts U.S., Dunkin' Donuts International,
                                   Baskin-Robbins International, and Baskin-Robbins U.S. Its restaurants offer hot and cold coffee,
                                   baked goods, donuts, bagels, muffins, breakfast sandwiches, hard-serve ice cream, soft-serve ice
                                   cream, frozen yogurt, shakes, malts, floats, and cakes.
                                         In February 2018, Dunkin' Brands announced plans to add about 1,000 net new Dunkin'
                                   Donuts locations in the United States in 2018-2020 and says more than 90 percent will be built
                                   outside of the Northeast. In this same press release, Dunkin reaffirmed its intention to eventually
                                   have more than 18,000 Dunkin' Donuts restaurants in the United States. This is a shot over the
                                   bow to Starbucks.
                                         Dunkin is determined to maintain and increase the U.S.-based Dunkin' Donuts share of
                                   the morning before-11 a.m. food and beverage sales, which account for 60 percent of Dunkin’s
                                   ­system-wide sales—as well as strengthening the company’s afternoon growth opportunities through
                                    menu innovation and national value offers. Dunkin is also doing the following in 2018-2020.

                   1. Continued focus on Cold Brew, Iced Coffee, and Frozen Dunkin' Coffee, which resulted in
                      its highest quarterly beverage comparable sales of the year in the fourth quarter of 2017.
                      Extend its premium tea and frozen beverage lines and introduce more espresso products.
                   2. After a record year for breakfast sandwich sales in 2017, emphasize morning sandwiches,
                      both new and returning favorites, like the early-2018 reintroduction of the Sweet Black
                      Pepper Bacon Breakfast Sandwich, and offering additional flavored bacon on sandwiches
                      throughout the year.
                   3. Being the largest retailer of donuts in America, heavily promote its annual calendar full
                      of seasonal donut offerings ready-to-go, leveraging key holidays like Valentine’s Day and
                      Halloween, while ensuring that its Dunkin' Dozen—the brand’s 12 best-selling donuts—are
                      available in each restaurant.
                   4. Eliminate all synthetic dyes from its national food and beverage menu in the United States
                      by the end of 2018.
                   5. Launch Dunkin' Deals, a series of value offers that are expected to be available at partici-

               McDonald’s Corporation (MCD)
               McDonald’s is the world’s leading global food-service retailer with over 36,000 locations in
               over 100 countries. Millions of people enjoy going to McDonald’s to get coffee. More than 80
               percent of McDonald’s restaurants worldwide are owned and operated by independent local
               businessmen and women. For the full year 2017, some financial highlights of McDonald’s are
               as follows:
                   • Global comparable sales increased 5.3 percent, but consolidated revenues decreased
                     7 ­percent.
                   • Consolidated operating income increased 23 percent.
                   • Diluted earnings per share increased 17% (17% in constant currencies).
                   • Returned $7.7 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends.
                   • Beginning in Q4 of 2017, began a 7 percent increase in its quarterly dividend to $1.01, dem-
                     onstrating management’s continued confidence in the company’s performance.
                    For 2018, McDonald’s plans to invest about $2.4 billion of capital, the majority of which
               will be dedicated to reinvesting in our existing locations through accelerated deployment of
               Experience of the Future in the United States. In addition, the company plans to open about
               1,000 new McDonald’s restaurants, 75 percent of which will be funded by licensees and affili-
               ates around the world. Concurrently, the company plans to invest heavily in technology to mod-
               ernize their customer experience and redefine convenience.
                    Headquartered in Oak Brook, Illinois, McDonald’s operates and franchises restaurants in
               the United States, Europe, the Asia/Pacific, the Middle East, Africa, Canada, Latin America, and
               internationally. The company’s restaurants offer various food products, soft drinks, coffee, and
               other beverages. The company operates close to 40,000 restaurants globally.

               Keurig Green Mountain
               The big news in 2018 in the beverage industry is that Keurig Green Mountain, the maker of
               Keurig K-Cup coffee machines, is acquiring Dr Pepper Snapple. Keurig is privately owned by
               JAB Holdings, one of Europe’s largest investment firms; JAB also owns Peet’s Coffee, Panera
               Bread, and Krispy Kreme doughnuts; JAB is a privately held fund that manages the money of
               the Reimann family, one of Germany’s wealthiest families. This acquisition, pending approval in
               Q2 2018, is aimed directly at both Coca-Cola and Starbucks Corp. This acquisition puts Keurig
               in the global soda business and strengthens its coffee business. Euromonitor reports that sales
               of ready-to-drink coffees increased more than 17 percent in 2017. JAB’s partner in Keurig is
               Mondelez International, who holds roughly 24 percent of the stock JAB, but that percentage will
               drop to about 14 percent when the Dr Pepper acquisition is finalized. Keurig’s revenue for 2017
               is estimated to be $4.1 billion, and its market share in the coffee-pod industry has declined from
               40 percent in 2013 to 23 percent in 2017.

                                   On February 27, 2018, Starbucks opened (at its Seattle headquarters) its first Reserve store in
                                   the United States, a new store format from the company’s Siren Retail business dedicated to its
                                   premium Reserve brand. Starbucks has announced plans to build 20-30 Roasteries and 1,000
                                   Reserve stores, with 20 percent of the Starbucks store portfolio eventually becoming Starbucks
                                   Reserve bar locations. Starbucks recently opened its first international Reserve roastery in
                                   Shanghai and launched the first Princi location in the United States inside its Seattle Reserve
                                   roastery. The company is bringing stand-alone Princi stores to Seattle, Chicago, and New York
                                   and plans to open roasteries in Milan and New York in late 2018, in addition to Tokyo and
                                   Chicago in 2019.
                                        The new Starbucks Reserve stores offer a new premium retail format with a marketplace-
                                   style environment offering Reserve roasteries, freshly baked artisanal Italian food from Rocco
                                   Princi and Third Place experience. The Reserve roasteries bring to life the theater of coffee
                                   roasting and brewing and packaging for customers. The Siren Retail segment also includes
                                   Starbucks Reserve bar locations and Princi bakeries. Reserve stores offer customers the full
                                   beverage menu available at the Seattle Reserve roastery, but with a few new items including
                                   Nitro Draft Latte and Spiced Ginger Cold Brew on tap, as well as new espresso drinks such as
                                   the Bianco Mocha. The Princi menu continues to offer customer favorites including cornetti,
                                   brioche, Pizza Mozzarella di Bufala, focaccia sandwiches; the space includes a full mixology
                                   bar serving traditional Italian Aperitivo, aromatic Italian cocktails such as Aperol Spritz, Milano
                                   Torino,​and Negroni Sbagliato, for afternoon and evening customers.
                                        Starbucks pays above the minimum wage in all states across the country. In April 2018, all
                                   eligible U.S. Starbucks hourly and salaried partners received a second wage increase in addition
                                   to the annual increases they have already received this fiscal year. The company also provided an
                                   additional 2018 stock grant for all eligible full-time, part-time, hourly, and salaried U.S. partners
                                   across their stores, plants, and support centers. In addition, all Starbucks retail partners received
                                   at least a $500 grant, store managers each received a $2,000 grant, and plant and support center
                                   partner (non-retail) grants varied depending on annualized salary or level. Starbucks has also
                                   announced plans to create more than 8,000 new part-time and full-time retail jobs and an addi-

                                   States over the next 5 years. Starbucks remains committed to providing opportunities to tens of
                                   thousands of Americans from disadvantaged backgrounds.
                                        In May 2018, Starbucks announced its formation of a global coffee alliance with Nestlé
                                   S.A. to increase both the at-home and away-from-home coffee and related categories around the
                                   world. As part of the alliance, Nestlé obtains the rights to market, sell, and distribute Starbucks,
                                   Seattle’s Best Coffee, Starbucks Reserve, Teavana, Starbucks VIA, and Torrefazione Italia pack-
                                   aged coffee and tea in all global at-home and away-from-home channels. In return, Nestlé pays
                                   Starbucks $7.15 billion, with Starbucks retaining a significant stake as licensor and supplier
                                   of roast and ground and other products going forward. The agreement also provides for the
                                   Starbucks’ brands to be represented on Nestlé’s single-serve capsule systems.
                                        Dunkin' Brands has announced aggressive new growth initiatives aimed directly at captur-
                                   ing Starbucks’ market share. Starbucks needs a clear strategic plan to effectively and efficiently
                                   manage its worldwide building of more than 1,000 Reserve stores, coupled with converting
                                   existing Starbucks restaurants to the new format, and doubling down on its human resource

               Headquartered in Purchase, New York, PepsiCo is the second-largest carbonated soft-drink
               maker in the world, behind Coca-Cola Company. In North America, PepsiCo is the largest food
               and beverage company, having soft-drink brands that include Pepsi-Cola, Mountain Dew, and
               Diet Pepsi, as well as Tropicana orange juice, Gatorade sports drink, SoBe tea, and Aquafina
               bottled water. Unlike Coca-Cola, PepsiCo is diversified, owning Frito-Lay and Quaker Foods.
               Frito-Lay is the largest salty snack provider in the United States, having brands that include
               Lay’s, Ruffles, Doritos, Cheetos, and Fritos; Quaker Foods offers breakfast cereals (Life,
               Quaker Oats), rice (Rice-A-Roni), and side dishes (Near East).
                    PepsiCo’s products are available in more than 200 countries where the company special-
               izes in innovating/changing products to match local tastes and cultures. For example, in Jordan,
               Bario, a nonalcoholic malt drink is popular, and Tropicana Pulp Sacs are popular in China.
               Fifty percent of company revenue comes from outside the United States and that percentage is
               increasing. PepsiCo is the largest food and beverage business in Russia, India, and the Middle
               East, is number two in Mexico, and is in the top five in Brazil, Turkey, and many other emerging
               markets like Vietnam, the Philippines, Thailand.
                    PepsiCo is forward integrated, owning its two largest bottlers, Pepsi Bottling Group and
               PepsiAmericas. Pepsi products are available worldwide through a variety of systems, including
               direct store delivery (DSD), broker-warehouse, food service, and vending machines. Twenty-
               two of PepsiCo’s products have generated retail sales of more than $1 billion, including three
               brands that recently reached this milestone: Diet Mountain Dew, Brisk, and Starbucks ready-to-
               drink beverages.
                    On December 20, 2017, PepsiCo stock switched to trade on the Nasdaq Global Select
               Market rather than the New York Stock Exchange. PepsiCo stock continues to trade under the
               symbol PEP. PepsiCo has increased its annual dividend for over 41 consecutive years. PepsiCo

               History
               The secret formula for Pepsi was developed in the 1880s by Caleb Bradham, a pharmacist in
               Newbern, North Carolina. Caleb named his product “Pepsi-Cola” in 1898. As his product gained
               popularity, he created the Pepsi-Cola Company in 1902 and registered a patent for his recipe
               in 1903. Interestingly, the formula for Coca-Cola was developed in 1886 by pharmacist John
               Pemberton in Columbus, Georgia. The Coca-Cola formula and brand was bought in 1889 by
               Asa Candler who incorporated The Coca-Cola Company in 1892. Pepsi-Cola Company was first
               incorporated in Delaware in 1919.
                    In 1965, the Pepsi-Cola Company merged with Frito-Lay, Inc., to become PepsiCo,
               Inc., as the company is known today. Between the late 1970s and the mid-1990s, PepsiCo
               expanded via the acquisition of restaurants and other businesses outside of its core focus of
               packaged food and beverage brands. This was a big strategic mistake and the company exited
               these noncore business lines largely in 1997, selling some and spinning off others into a
               new company that is now known as Yum! Brands. A few brands formerly owned by PepsiCo

                                   include Pizza Hut, Taco Bell, Kentucky Fried Chicken, D’Angelo Sandwich Shops, Wilson
                                   Sporting Goods, North American Van Lines, and Stolichnaya. In December 2005, PepsiCo
                                   surpassed Coca-Cola Company in market value for the first time in 112 years since both
                                   companies began to compete.
                                        PepsiCo purchased Tropicana Products in 1998 and acquired Quaker Oats Company in
                                   2001. In 2010, PepsiCo acquired its two largest bottlers in North America: Pepsi Bottling Group
                                   and PepsiAmericas. In 2011, PepsiCo made its largest international acquisition by purchasing
                                   Wimm-Bill-Dann Foods, a Russian food company that produces milk, yogurt, fruit juices, and
                                   dairy products. This acquisition made PepsiCo the largest food and beverage company in Russia.
                                   This acquisition boosted PepsiCo’s nutrition portfolio. In January 2012, PepsiCo hired its first
                                   female CEO, Indra Nooyi, who remains CEO today.
                                        PepsiCo is having trouble with its Gatorade brand whose sales in the United States d­ eclined
                                   0.5 percent to $5.9 billion in 2017. This was the brand’s first decline in annual sales since 2012.
                                   Gatorade accounts for about 20 percent of PepsiCo’s North American drink volume. The company
                                   released Gatorade Organic in August 2016 and made $20 million on that product through the end
                                   of 2017. The sports-drink market is becoming highly competitive; even up-start BodyArmour, a
                                   distant third in market share, is gaining rapidly on PepsiCo in sports drinks, such as Gatorade.
                                        In May 2018, PepsiCo acquired Bare Foods, Inc., which makes Bare Snacks, a line of
                                   healthy fruit and vegetable snacks. Headquartered in San Francisco, California, Bare Foods is
                                   owned and operated by Bob and Diana Carroll. The purchase of Bare fits into PepsiCo’s strat-
                                   egy to diversify further into healthy and nutritious products. Bare began its business in 2001 by
                                   selling baked apple chips at local farmers’ markets and steadily expanded, becoming a leader
                                   in apple, banana, and coconut snacks, and recently adding vegetable chips to its line. All Bare
                                   products are baked, not fried, and are also Non-GMO Project-verified. Bare will continue to
                                   operate independently from San Francisco, with its leadership reporting to PepsiCo’s Frito-Lay
                                   North America Division.

                                   Values, Vision, and Mission
                                   Under the broad umbrella of “acting ethically and responsibly,” PepsiCo describes its values as
                                   the principles of workplace respect, integrity in the marketplace, the golden rule, and responsi-
                                   bility to its shareholders.
                                        A version of PepsiCo’s vision and mission statements can be found at the following company
                                   website: https://www.pepsicoindia.co.in/. Its vision reflects the goals of ensuring superior financial
                                   performance and achieving a positive social and environmental impact. What PepsiCo describes as
                                   its mission reflects a focus on product, with an emphasis on the wide range of its food and bever-
                                   age offerings around the world. It also states PepsiCo’s long-term goal of success through invest-
                                   ments in its employees, the company itself, and the communities of the markets it serves.

                                   Organizational Structure
                                   PepsiCo breaks down their business in the Americas by foods versus beverages, but their Latin
                                   America and outside North America business units include beverages, foods, and snacks. Yes,
                                   this is confusing and the company has changed it almost annually. PepsiCo’s top executives are
                                   listed in Exhibit 1 along with an organizational chart. The chart depicted reveals only three lev-
                                   els: the CEO, the functional-level executives, and the line/regional-level executives. Probably no
                                   one but PepsiCo insiders know exactly who reports to who—but what is important for students
                                   is to devise a r­ecommended reporting relationship, perhaps deleting some positions and creat-
                                   ing others, to more clearly reveal for all insiders and outsiders the chain of command. Likely,
                                   PepsiCo would function best with a strategic business unit (SBU) type structure comprised of
                                   two SBU’s—beverages and food—with regional presidents reporting to those two individuals.
                                   PepsiCo’s executive titles should match with the company’s segment titles FLNA, QFNA, NAB,
                                   Latin America, ESSA, and AMENA.

                                   Segments
                                   PepsiCo is transparent in its reporting of financial information by segment. PepsiCo ­monitors
                                   and reports results of their operations in six segments as given below. Note that in Latin
                                   America and outside North America, PepsiCo’s beverages and snacks are combined as segments
                                   (ESSA and AMENA).

                    Exhibit 2 provides a breakdown of PepsiCo’s revenues by division for 2016 and 2017.
               Notice that NAB is the largest revenue contributor but this segment’s revenues decreased
               in 2017. Note also that the ESSA segment reported the largest percentage increase in revenues in
               2017. Note the 5 percent decrease in AMENA compared to the 8 percent increase in ESSA.
                    Exhibits 3 and 4 provide a breakdown of PepsiCo’s 2017 operating profit (EBIT) compared
               to the prior year. Note the decrease in QFNA and NAB but the near doubling in AMENA. Note
               the 29 percent decrease in NAB for 2017 compared to the 173 percent increase in AMENA.

               Finance
               In early 2018, PepsiCo announced a new repurchase program of up to $15 billion of PepsiCo
               common stock commencing on July 1, 2018 and expiring on June 30, 2021. This will replace
               the $12 billion repurchase program which commenced on July 1, 2015 and expired on June 30,
               2018. Also in early 2018, PepsiCo announced a 15 percent increase in its annual dividend per
               share to $3.71 from $3.22 per share, such that total dollar of dividends to be paid to shareholders
               in 2018 would be about $5 billion, compared to about $2 billion being devoted to buying back
               shares of stock.

                      Pepsi’s share price has struggled in the first half of 2018, down about 19 percent in the
               first five months of the year to just below $100 per share. The key reason why Pepsi’s stock
               ­demise has been that the company’s largest market segment, North American Beverages (NAB),
                ­consistently reports flat revenues and declines in operating profits. The NAB segment makes
                 up more than 33 percent of the company’s total revenue, and that segment’s operating profit
                 ­decreased 23 percent in Q1 of 2018 when compared to Q1 of 2017.

                                            Competitors
                                            Coca-Cola Company and Dr Pepper Snapple are Coke’s two primary competitors, but other rival
                                            firms include Nestlé SA, Groupe Danone, Suntory Beverage & Food Limited (“Suntory”), and
                                            Monster Beverage Corporation. Unlike Coke, PepsiCo derives most of its revenues and growth
                                            from its snack food business rather than its beverages. Danone competes to a lesser degree with
                                            Coke. The number-three soft drink producer, Dr Pepper Snapple, produces and markets non-
                                            alcoholic beverages in the United States, Canada, Mexico, and the Caribbean. Exhibit 7 reveals
                                            the top 10 beverages sold in the United States. Note that Coke, inclusive of Coke Zero, Diet
                                            Coke, and other brands, lead among the top 10, but PepsiCo has four brands in the top 10. Down
                                            the percent change column in Exhibit 7, notice that bottled water has the largest growth.
                                                 As indicated in Exhibit 8, PepsiCo is 10 times larger than Dr Pepper Snapple and based on
                                            market capitalization (stock price times number of shares outstanding). However, PepsiCo is
                                            much larger than Coke on numerous other variables as given.

                                            Headquartered in Atlanta, Georgia, Coca-Cola Company (Coke) is the world’s largest producer and
                                            distributor of beverages, marketing over 500 nonalcoholic brands in more than 200 countries. Coke
                                            has 21 billion-dollar brands, 19 of which are available in lower- and no-sugar options. Four of the

               top five beverages sold globally are Coca-Cola, Diet Coke, Fanta, and Sprite. Other Coke products
               include AdeS soy-based beverages, Ayataka green tea, Dasani waters, Del Valle juices and nectars,
               Fanta, Georgia coffee, Gold Peak teas and coffees, Honest Tea, Minute Maid juices, Powerade
               sports drinks, Simply juices, Glaceau Smartwater, Sprite, and Zico coconut water. However, the
               company’s revenues for 2017 declined 15 percent so rumblings are spreading within the firm.
                     Coke brands sold mostly outside the United States include Ayataka green tea in Japan, I
               LOHAS water in Japan, Ice Dew water in China, FUZE TEA outside the United States, Minute
               Maid Pulpy in Asia Pacific, Georgia coffee in Japan, and Del Valle in Latin America. Five large
               independent bottling companies supply Coke with 39 percent of their bottling needs. The largest
               independent bottler is Coca-Cola FEMSA who supplies central Mexico and countries in Latin
               and South America.
                     Company revenues have declined every year for nearly a decade. Coke’s net income also
               declined. Since 2005, sales of diet soda, in general, have dropped every year, a combined 34
               percent. Although Diet Coke is the weakest link in the company’s whole soda lineup, the brand
               is still the third-best selling carbonated drink in the United States.
                     Even environmentalists are complaining, saying Coke produces 110 million plastic bottles
               annually that end up in landfills and oceans. To combat this complaint, the company launched in
               2018 its “World Without Waste” initiative. Coke needs a good strategic plan since its customer
               base is eroding and its shareholders want sustained 5 percent annual growth in revenues and
               profits—not declines every year.

               Dr Pepper Snapple Group, Inc. (DPS)
               Headquartered in Plano, Texas, DPS manufactures nonalcoholic beverages in the United
               States, Canada, Caribbean, and Mexico. It also markets ready-to-drink teas, juices, juice
               drinks, water, and mixers. The company offers brands such as: 7UP, A&W, Bai, Crush,
               Canada Dry, Schweppes, Sunkist, Squirt, Hawaiian Punch, and RC Cola. DPS m         ­ anufactures
               and sells Mott’s applesauce. DPS’s revenues increased slightly from $6.2 billion in 2014
               to $6.3 billion in 2015, to $6.4 billion in 2016, to $6.7 in 2017. DPS’s net income also has
               increased slightly every year. DPS recently acquired Bai Brands for about $1.7 billion. DPS
               currently has about 8.5 percent of the U.S. nonalcoholic beverage market, according to
               Euromonitor International.
                    DPS owns 7 of the top 10 non-cola soft drinks on the market. Third quarter (Q3) 2017
               results showed DPS’s carbonated soft drinks decreasing 1 percent while its non-carbonated
               beverages increased 6 percent. Q3 showed flat sales in the United States and Canada, but sales
               in Mexico and the Caribbean increased 2 percent. Also for Q3, the DPS brand named Clamato
               grew 7 percent and Mott’s applesauce sales grew 5 percent, but Snapple sales declined 5 percent.
                    The big news in 2018 in the beverage industry is that Keurig Green Mountain, the maker of
               Keurig K-Cup coffee machines, acquired Dr Pepper Snapple in 2018. Keurig is privately owned
               by JAB Holdings, one of Europe’s largest investment firms; JAB also owns Peet’s Coffee, Panera
               Bread, and Krispy Kreme doughnuts. JAB is a privately held fund that manages the money of
               the Reimann family, one of Germany’s wealthiest families. This acquisition, pending approval

               Keurig in the global soda business and strengthens its coffee business. Euromonitor reports that
               sales of ready-to-drink coffees increased more than 17 percent in 2017. JAB’s partner in Keurig
               is Mondelez International that holds roughly 24 percent of the stock JAB, but that percentage
               dropped to about 14 percent when the Dr Pepper acquisition was finalized. Keurig’s revenue for
               2017 was about $4.1 billion and its market share in the coffee-pod industry has declined from 40
               percent in 2013 to approximately 23 percent in 2017.

               Groupe Danone
               Headquartered in Paris, France, Groupe Danone is the number-one producer of yogurt in the
               world, the number-two bottled water, and baby nutrition manufacturer, number-one in manu-
               facturing fresh dairy products, and the European leader in medical nutrition. Danone’s primary
               brand in bottled water is Evian. Danone sells flavored waters and focuses on health-conscious
               consumers. One brand is Levite, a big success in Mexico. Danone continues to add new drinks in
               different markets, such as Taillefine Fiz in France, which is a zero-calorie soda that has achieved
               a number-2 ranking in the French low-calorie segment. Danone is present in over 130 markets

                                   Monster Beverage Company (MNST)
                                   Headquartered in Corona, California, Monster Beverage develops, markets, sells, and dis-
                                   tributes energy drink beverages, sodas and/or concentrates for energy drink beverages, under
                                   brand names such as Monster Energy, Monster Rehab, Monster Energy Extra Strength Nitrous

                                         Coca-Cola owns 16.7 percent of the Monster Beverage, which it purchased in 2015 for
                                   approximately $2.15 billion. In October 2017, Coca-Cola transferred ownership of all of its
                                   worldwide energy businesses including NOS, Full Throttle, and nine smaller brands to Monster
                                   Beverage Company. At the same time, Monster transferred all of its non-energy drink businesses
                                   to Coca-Cola, including Hansen’s natural sodas, Peace Tea, Hubert’s Lemonade, and Hansen’s
                                   juice products. As shown in Exhibit 10, energy drinks comprise 4.8 percent of all nonalcoholic
                                   beverages sold.
                                         Monster Beverage’s sales for Q3 2017 that ended September 30, 2017 increased 11.5 percent
                                   to $2.6 billion from $2.3 billion versus the prior year. Net income for Q3 was $619.4 million,
                                   compared with $539.7 million the prior year. Net sales for Monster’s Strategic Brands segment,
                                   which includes the various energy drink brands acquired from Coke, increased 6.2 percent to
                                   $76.6 million for that Q3, up from $72.1 million the prior year. Monster’s sales to customers
                                   ­outside the United States increased 36.3 percent to $260.1 million in that Q3, up from $190.8
                                    million in the prior year period. Net income for Q3 increased 14.1 percent to $218.7 million from

                                   Bottled Water
                                   In 2016, bottled water surpassed carbonated soft drinks as the largest beverage category in the
                                   United States by volume. Per capita consumption of bottled water reached more than 39.0 gal-
                                   lons annually, compared with around 38.5 gallons for carbonated soft drinks. Within the next
                                   decade, bottled water consumption per capita is expected to surpass 50 gallons. The U.S. bottled
                                   water market showed strong growth in terms of volume and revenues in the past 3 years. Bottled
                                   water sales are booming, up 7.3, 7.9, and 8.6 percent in 2014, 2015, and 2016, respectively. By
                                   comparison, carbonated soft drink volumes declined 2.1, 2.4, and 0.8 percent during those years.

               According to BMC, in 2017, bottled water sales are projected to grow 8 to 9 percent, remaining
               the top nonalcoholic beverage for years to come—further confirmation of the shift in consumer
               preference toward healthier and lower-calorie options.

               Sparkling Water
               Sparkling water is projected to outpace even bottled water in the next decade as consumers search
               for tastier but healthier options. In fact, sparkling water sales surged more than 20 percent in 2017.
               Flavored sparkling water sales grew by more than 15 percent in 2017 to $2.4 billion. To better
               reach this flavored sparkling water market, in early 2018, PepsiCo released its seltzer water brand
               called Bubly. Other beverages also growing in sales are flavored and enhanced ­water, ready-to-
               drink coffee, and energy drinks. Specifically, sales of flavored and enhanced water in the United
               States increased 12.3 percent in 2016, followed by ready-to-drink coffee up 11.0 p­ ercent, and en-
               ergy drinks up 4.8 percent.
                    Given the above positive trends, carbonated soft drinks still account for 83.5 percent of
               the beverages industry’s market capitalization as of September 2017. In 2016, soda consump-
               tion in the United States fell 0.8 percent, continuing the downward trend. Consequently, in Q2
               2017, Coke reported a 16 percent drop in net revenues to $9.7 billion. In that Q2, Coke reported
               increased volume for juice, dairy, and plant-based beverages (with 3% growth), tea and coffee
               (2%), as well as water, enhanced water, and sports drinks (1%). Coke is shifting its portfolio
               toward smaller-sized packages and healthier beverages. In August 2017, Coke replaced its
               Coke Zero products with the zero-sugar and zero-calorie brand Coke Zero Sugar. For PepsiCo,
               food and snacks volume increased 2 percent in the first half of 2017, while beverages declined
               1 percent.

               R&D
               To reverse revenue declines, beverage firms boosted R&D spending at an average annual rate
               of nearly 20 percent over the past 5 years. R&D spending is likely to remain high in 2017 and
               2018 as beverage companies strive to rejuvenate revenue growth. Developing flavored sparkling
               waters is an example.

                Outside the United States
                In 2016, international operations represented 62 percent of total non-bottling revenues at Coke
                and 42 percent at PepsiCo. Coke does business in countries using currencies other than the
                U.S. dollar, including the euro, the Japanese yen, the Brazilian real, and the Mexican peso.
                Coke uses 72 currencies in addition to the U.S. dollar. Unfavorable foreign currency exchange
                rates can have a significant effect on reported revenue growth for global beverage manufactur-
                ers, ­especially since the U.S. dollar’s value relative to foreign currencies is on average at a
               ­three-year low.

               City, County, State, and Federal Taxes
               Public health advocates are actively lobbying for soda tax referendums and legislation in more
               U.S. cities. Companies such as Coke and PepsiCo Soda spent nearly $70 million from 2009 to
               late 2016 lobbying against soda taxes and warning label measures in U.S. cities and states, as
               well as an average of about $15 million annually on federal lobbying, according to the consumer
               advocacy group Center for Science in the Public Interest (CSPI). For example, beverage compa-
               nies spent about $9.4 million between January 2016 and June 2016 to oppose the Philadelphia
               City Council’s soda tax proposal, according to CSPI’s estimates. Philadelphia eventually
               ­imposed a soda tax in June 2016, the first major U.S. city (and the second city after Berkeley,
                California) to do so. In November 2016, three cities in California (San Francisco, Albany, and
                Oakland) passed their own soda tax laws, as did Cook County, Illinois (which includes Chicago)
                and Boulder, Colorado. In June 2017, Seattle implemented a tax of $1.75 cents per ounce on
                sugary drinks and soda. Chicago’s soda tax began in Fall 2017.
                     Taxes on sugary beverages came into effect in Mexico on January 1, 2014, in an effort to
                combat obesity in the country; higher product costs are likely to dampen demand, and tax rev-
                enue could help to fund costs related to preventive actions and medical treatment. Mexico is the
                country with the biggest obesity problem in the world, according to the Food and Agriculture
                Organization of the United Nations. This will be a game changer for beverage companies

                                    Price-sensitive consumers are turning away from buying soda products.

                                   Beverage Caloric Intake in the United States
                                   In December 2017, the American Beverage Association reported that the average American
                                   drank 201.2 calories a day in 2016, up slightly from 2015. More than offsetting the decline
                                   in sales of soda and juice in cans or bottles, sales of soda from fountains in restaurants are
                                   ­increasing. And Americans are drinking more and more sweet tea at restaurants. In terms of
                                    liquid ­intake, the average beverage calories consumed in the United States per capita, per day
                                    in 2016, was sodas (126.7), juice (42.5), teas (11.2), sports (10.6), and other (10.2)—according
                                    to the Beverage Marketing Corporation. Consumption of diet and low-calorie soda continues
                                    to fall, but consumption of sports and energy drinks continues to rise at a faster rate. Exhibit 10

                                   Impulse Buying
                                   PepsiCo is reinvesting some of the millions of dollars it is saving under the new tax laws in
                                   ­e-commerce, which today accounts for roughly $1 billion in the company’s annual retail sales.
                                    PepsiCo is also investing savings in training for workers, cash returns for shareholders, and
                                    $100 million in employee bonuses. The rise of online shopping is bad news for Coca-Cola
                                    and PepsiCo because impulse buying makes up roughly 30 percent of overall beverage sales.
                                    Without customers grabbing a Diet Pepsi while checking out at Walmart or a two-liter bottle of
                                    Coke Zero at the grocery store, the beverage companies would be in big trouble. Sales of soft
                                    drinks by volume have dropped for 12 consecutive years in the United States, so companies like
                                    Coca-Cola and PepsiCo need impulse buying, which is being eroded by more online shopping.
                                    Coca-Cola is currently investigating click-and-collect grocery sales, bundled deals (such as meal
                                    kits), and new impulse “triggers” online.

                                   Future
                                   International operations represent about 62 percent of total non-bottling revenues at Coca-Cola
                                   and 42 percent at PepsiCo. PepsiCo obtains approximately 60 percent of its revenues from its
                                   food divisions. Last year, PepsiCo and Coca-Cola invested in craft soda brands trying to reverse
                                   decreasing soda volume sales. After acquiring two craft soda brands from Monster Beverages,
                                   Coca-Cola recently relaunched Blue Sky and Hansen’s. A few days later, PepsiCo launched
                                   the 1893 Original Cola and Ginger Cola lines, which are made with sparkling water, kola nut
                                   ­extract, and Fair Trade certified sugar.
                                         In August 2016, PepsiCo released a craft carbonated beverage brand called Stubborn, pri-
                                    marily targeting millennials, who prefer healthy beverages. The product uses stevia leaf extract
                                    instead of artificial sweeteners; Stubborn is available in unusual flavors such as black cherry
                                    with tarragon, lemon berry acai, and orange hibiscus. According to PepsiCo, craft sodas are a
                                    growing product line opportunity.

                    PepsiCo is having trouble with its Gatorade energy drink brand whose sales in the United
               States declined 0.5 percent to $5.9 billion in 2017. This was the brand’s first decline in annual
               sales since 2012. Gatorade accounts for about 20 percent of PepsiCo’s North American drink
               volume. The company released Gatorade Organic in August 2016 and made $20 million on that
               product through the end of 2017. The sports-drink market is becoming highly competitive; even
               up-start BodyArmour, a distant third in market share, is gaining rapidly on PepsiCo in sports
               drinks, such as Gatorade.
                    The steady decline in consumption of carbonated beverages necessitates that PepsiCo for-
               mulate and implement new strategies going forward. The company needs a full-blown, compre-
               hensive strategic plan in order to determine specific actions needed under the following general
               categories of strategies:
                   1.   Further global expansion to tap markets not yet saturated
                   2.   Continued product development to introduce new healthy drinks
                   3.   Acquisition of small rival firms to gain growth in revenues
                   4.   Continued market penetration with extensive advertising and promotion to shift consumer
                        perception away from unhealthiness to treating yourself with a soda
                   5.   Continued shift to smaller cans and package sizes
                   6.   Perhaps diversification into snacks and foods as PepsiCo has successfully done
                   7.   Push aggressively into bottled water to capitalize on rapid growth in that sector
                   8.   Develop natural sweeteners to replace artificial sweeteners
                   9.   Increase lobbying to curtail city, county, and state sugar taxes

                                   http://www.audubon.org/
                                   Headquartered in New York City, the National Audubon Society (NAS) is a non-profit organization
                                   dedicated to conservation with special emphasis on bird protection. It is one of the oldest of such
                                   organizations in the world and uses science, education, and grassroots advocacy to advance its con-
                                   servation mission. The organization is named in honor of John James Audubon, a Franco-American
                                   ornithologist and naturalist who painted, cataloged, and described the birds of North America birds in
                                   his famous book Birds of America published in sections between 1827 and 1838.
                                        At the website www.audubon.org/news/how-birds-would-fare-under-white-house-budget-and-
                                   infrastructure-proposals, the NAS news release on February 14, 2018, named many birds that will
                                   be hurt if the Trump administration’s infrastructure proposals get approved. Such birds mentioned
                                   include the tricolored blackbird common loon, yellow-billed cuckoo, snowy plover, reddish egret,
                                   and roseate spoonbill. NAS claims to be non-political but the flavor of their website reveals a strong
                                   Democratic backing. NAS opposes oil drilling, for example, along the U.S. Pacific and Atlantic
                                   coasts, etc. It might benefit NAS going forward to list on their website both side’s arguments, such as
                                   benefits to communities and citizens versus benefits to birds, so as not to come across as being politi-
                                   cally one-sided on key issues.

                                   History
                                   The year was 1896 and both Harriet Hemenway and her cousin Minna Hall were outraged—
                                   millions of water birds had been slaughtered in order to make plumes for women’s hats. Harriet
                                   and Minna initiated a campaign targeted at convincing Boston society ladies to stop wearing
                                   hats with bird feathers. This campaign led to the establishment of the Massachusetts Audubon
                                   Society the same year. Within 2 years, what started as a series of talks during afternoon tea had
                                   grown and spread across the country. State-level Audubon Societies sprang up in New York,
                                   Washington, D.C., Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Connecticut, New Hampshire, Illinois, Maine,
                                   Wisconsin, Rhode Island, Ohio, Indiana, Tennessee, Minnesota, California, and Texas.
                                         In 1900, Audubon member Frank M. Chapman proposed the first yearly Christmas Bird
                                   Count as an alternative to the Christmas “Side Hunt” tradition, the latter of which was a com-
                                   petition between hunters to kill as many mammals as possible, including birds. The Christmas
                                   Bird Count (CBC), which has become a long-standing tradition, involves volunteers from across
                                   North America counting bird sightings from December 14 to January 5 and creating a census
                                   of bird populations. Every November, tens of thousands of volunteers sign up on Audubon’s
                                   website to participate in the CBC, even in the harshest of weathers. The Christmas Bird Count
                                   is the country’s most lasting community science bird project, and it contributes a great deal to
                                   Audubon’s work. It is funded completely by donations which go toward supporting compilers
                                   and volunteers on count day and maintaining technology infrastructure.
                                         In 1903, the state-level Audubon Societies joined efforts to help establish the National
                                   Wildlife Refuge in Florida. To leverage their size and combined strength, the state-level societies
                                   came together and founded the National Association of Audubon Societies in 1905 with an
                                   agenda which prioritizes the protection of water birds, including gulls, terns, egrets, and herons.
                                         The 1918 signing of the Migratory Bird Treaty Act (MBTA) by President Wilson constituted a
                                   regulatory landmark year in the efforts to protect North American birds. This law places all migra-
                                   tory birds under federal protection and still remains one of the strongest laws enacted to protect birds.
                                   Soon after its passing, the NAS started a system of waterbird sanctuaries in seven eastern states which
                                   initiated scientific conservation endeavors on a large-scale across the country. In 1940, the National
                                   Association of Audubon Societies officially became the National Audubon Society (NAS).
                                         In 2011, NAS developed a strategic plan aimed at creating one Audubon, both in practice
                                   and in writing. This plan helped establish partnerships throughout the United States and fostered

                                                                                                CASE 29 • National Audubon Society—2018    643


               collaborations among chapters, and resulted in growth in NAS’s annual budget from $73 million
               to over $100 million. Audubon’s initiatives broadened focus from single local efforts to a focus
               on full-lifecycle conservation of birds across the Americas, including five habitats that birds
               need to thrive: Coasts, Working Lands, Water, Climate, and Bird-Friendly Communities.
                    In early 2018, there are 23 NAS state offices, 41 nature centers, 454 independent local
               ­chapters, and 23 sanctuaries, all of which work together.

               Vision/Mission
               NAS does not appear to have a formal vision statement. However, the organization’s website
               states (paraphrased) that, “Our vision is to create a world in which people and wildlife thrive.”
               NAS’s mission is perhaps captured in a statement (paraphrased) saying “we strive to conserve
               and restore natural ecosystems, focusing on birds, other wildlife, and their habitats for the ben-
               efit of humanity and global biological diversity.” Other wording could reflect upon the mission
               of NAS such as to protect birds and the places they need, today and tomorrow, throughout the
               Americas using science, advocacy, education, and on-the-ground conservation.
                    Audubon’s state programs, nature centers, chapters, and partners reach millions of people
               each year to inform, inspire, and unite diverse communities in conservation action.

               Internal Issues
               Organizational Structure
               In January 2018, NAS hired several new executives who come with extensive experience. For
               example, Sarah Rose, CEO of the California League of Conservation Voters, has years of experi-
               ence forming important relationships with key public policy officials and politicians.
                    NAS appears to operate using a divisional organizational structure by flyway, yet the
               Atlantic and Pacific flyways are not represented in executive titles. Perhaps no one but NAS in-
               siders know exactly who reports to whom among the current executives, but what is important in
               this case is for students to recommend an effective organizational structure going forward rather
               than trying to decipher the existing structure of the organization. Exhibit 1 provides a list of the
               NAS top executives and a possible existing organizational chart for the current organization.

                                   Strategic Plan
                                   NAS posts its strategic plan on the organization’s website. Four key pillars are the focus of
                                   NAS’s 2016–2020 strategic plan: Conservation, Network, Science, and Durable Public Will.

                                   Conservation Programs
                                   Conservation programs are NAS’s largest expense, constituting 82 percent of total expenses in
                                   2017, or $104.5 million. The conservation programs are categorized as either field conserva-
                                   tion programs or national conservation programs. Field programs are implemented by NAS’s
                                   23 offices across different states and regions. The ultimate goal of field programs is to achieve
                                   complete lifecycle conservation for all bird species within its focus areas. Field programs con-
                                   stitute the majority (~70–75%) of conservation expenses, with national programs constituting
                                   the remaining 25–30 percent. Some of NAS’s national conservation programs include: Climate
                                   Initiative, Network, Science, Policy, Marketing & Engagement, Hemispheric Strategy, and
                                   Diversity & Inclusion.

                                   Network
                                   Audubon’s network consists of state offices, nature centers, volunteers, chapters, employees,
                                   donors, and partners. Recognizing the importance of its network, NAS recently added the new
                                   Chief Network Officer position which is held by David Ringer whose focus is on leading growth
                                   and expertise development across the Audubon network. He coordinates activities among NAS
                                   offices, centers, and chapters. Audubon’s network includes its nature centers which receive one
                                   million visitors per year. NAS partners with BirdLife International to implement conservation
                                   programs in the United States. NAS contributes data and scientific research to other organiza-
                                   tions both nationally and internationally, and partners with five countries on implementing
                                   policy changes that are favorable to bird populations.

                                   Science
                                   NAS leverages its volunteer-based bird monitoring to collect data which serves as the foundation
                                   for the organization’s development of conservation and bird advocacy programs, while also fos-
                                   tering local engagement and building public interests in bird science. The organization conducts
                                   scientific research to influence strategic goals, and gathers data along flyways on bird habitat, how
                                   bird species are responding to changes in climate, etc. Through events such as the Christmas Bird
                                   Count (CBC) and Great Backyard Bird Count, NAS encourages local participation in data gather-
                                   ing, engages with communities and citizens, and strives to raise awareness in bird issues. Details
                                   gathered from science programs gives NAS a unique data point for its conservation efforts.

                                   Durable Public Will
                                   Public will is essential for bird well-being, so NAS works to ensure that public policy and
                                   private enterprises avoid engaging in activities which may be harmful to birds or their f­uture

               environments. For example, in 2018, a jetty was to be constructed at Shallotte Inlet near
               Ocean Isle Beach, North Carolina, but a lawsuit by NAS alleging the jetty would harm nesting
               bird populations shut down the project to the dismay of many local boaters. NAS is an activist,
               continuously engaging with the public to keep bird and conservation-related issues at the top of
               citizens’ minds throughout the Americas.
                       The NAS works to encourage the passage of bird-friendly policies and legislation that
               ­increase the use of renewable energy. Such efforts are bipartisan in nature and take full advan-
                tage of NAS’s one million members and allies. NAS has achieved success over the years in
                areas such as: 1) restoring large ecosystems such as the Arctic Slope in Alaska, the Everglades
                ­wetlands, and the Mississippi River Delta; 2) protecting nearly 3,000 important bird areas cover-
                 ing ­approximately 400 million acres of public and private lands; and, 3) supporting laws like the
                 Clean Air Act, Clean Water Act, Endangered Species Act, and the Neotropical Migratory Bird
                 Conservation Act.
                       To accomplish its “durable public will” goals, engagement with grassroots supporters is key,
                 but NAS also uses its website, social media platforms, marketing through email, and AUDUBON
                 magazine, which has a readership of 1.5 million people. Through digital applications, the NAS
                 has achieved over 1 million downloads of its nature guides.

               Strategy
               NAS strives to educate schoolchildren, families, and nature lovers of all ages by offering infor-
               mative materials and programs at the Audubon centers and sanctuaries, as well as through the
               Audubon Magazine. Using its network, NAS develops conservation plans and then works with
               lawmakers and other agencies to implement programs to promote bird welfare and petition or
               file lawsuits against initiatives that could harm birdlife.
                     NAS volunteers and bird enthusiasts for more than a hundred years have participated in
               ­annual “citizen science programs” aimed at collecting census-type data of birds throughout the
                Americas. Today, this data is used by Audubon, as well as other wildlife agencies, conservation
                biologists, etc. to assess the current state of bird populations, identify trends in the evolution and
                health of bird species, reveal changes in migratory or flight patterns, and to ultimately guide the
                development of necessary conservation initiatives.
                     NAS’s strategy for bird conservation focuses in five key areas: 1) Coasts, 2) Working Lands,
                3) Water, 4) Climate, and 5) Bird-Friendly Communities. These areas aim to cover the f­ ull-lifecycle
                of bird breeding, wintering, and migration throughout the Americas.

               Coasts
               The NAS’s conservation efforts on coasts are focused on protecting and rehabilitating coastlines
               to give shorebirds a better chance of survival. NAS does not like the rise in sea levels due to
               climate change and works its network to change policies at the local, state, and national level
               to favor birdlife. The NAS partners with organizations with similar interests in Latin America.
               Coastal area initiatives and programs represent the greatest cost to NAS, and it allocates $18–
               $20 million annually of its budget to conservation efforts in this regard.

               Working Lands
               Nearly half of the land in the lower 48 states are referred to by NAS as “working lands.”
               Audubon partners with forest, ranch, and farm landowners, land managers, private industry
               ­organizations, and governmental agencies to enhance the condition of bird habitats, promote
                bird-friendly practices, and devise policies for large-scale land management conversation prac-
                tices. NAS tries to get landowners to adopt methods that are beneficial to birds, and annually
                allocates about $8–10 million to “take care of birds on working lands.”

               Water
               The NAS’s conservation efforts in this area are around getting the public involved on water rights
               and improving the quality of water, rehabilitating bird habitats beside the rivers, and l­everaging

                                   other open market initiatives that can help to achieve its goals. NAS allocates $12–15 million of
                                   its budget to these efforts.

                                   Climate
                                   NAS scientists have concluded that North American bird species face the possibility of losing at
                                   least half of their habitat by the year 2080 due to rising sea levels. To combat this, NAS spends
                                   between $10–12 million annually of curtailing global warming by working with local, state, and
                                   federal officials to help birds by reversing global warming. Some analysts say NAS is too harsh
                                   on Americans since much of the cause for global warming falls on other countries such as China.
                                   In Bangkok, Thailand, for example, air pollution was so bad in 2018 that residents were encour-
                                   aged to wear masks outside of homes and buildings.

                                   Bird-Friendly Communities
                                   NAS allocates $12–14 million of its annual budget to the work of creating bird-friendly com-
                                   munities. The organization especially wants to protect breeding places for birds, especially along
                                   coastal areas.

                                   Finance
                                   NAS’s fiscal year ends on June 30. The organization’s income statements and balance
                                   sheets are provided in Exhibit 3 and Exhibit 4, respectively. NAS generated revenue of
                                   $112.2 ­million during 2017, up 9.33 percent from the previous year. Most of the revenue
                                   (69 percent) came from contributions and grants from donors and members; 12 percent
                                   came from bequests; 8 percent of the revenue stemmed from earned income; 9 percent
                                   from investment earnings, and the remaining 2 percent of revenue came from royalties.
                                   Total ­expenses in 2017 were $104.5 million, resulting in $7.7 million in earnings before
                                   tax. Eighty-two percent of expenses were from conservation programs (59 percent field
                                   programs and 23 percent national programs); 14 percent was for fundraising activities
                                   (5 ­percent for membership development and 9 percent for other development activities), and
                                   4 percent was spent on general management expenses. Endowments for fiscal 2017 grew by
                                   $53.4 million to $185.3 million.
                                        Notice on the balance sheets that NAS is very liquid having a current ratio over 7. Some
                                   select financial ratios are provided in Exhibit 5 and reveal that NAS is quite liquid, has
                                   ­improving margins, and has reduced its debt situation—so fiscal 2017 was an improvement
                                    from 2016 for the organization. Exhibit 6 provides a further breakdown of NAS’s spending in
                                    2016 and 2017.

               tion’s hunting and fishing heritage. Dale Hall, CEO of Ducks Unlimited, says his organization
               “looks forward to working with the Department of the Interior to help identify opportunities to
               increase access for sportsmen and women.”
                    National Wildlife Refuges in the United States currently have more than 53 million visitors
               a year. Among these lands, 337 wildlife refuges and 37 wetland management districts are open to
               hunting in accordance with state regulations. If the new proposal is approved, 377 refuges would
               be open for hunting opportunities. Greg Sheehan, U.S. Fish Wildlife Service (USFWS) principal
               deputy director, fully supports the proposal, saying “Hunters and anglers have provided critical
               funding for wildlife conservation in America for more than a century.” The National Wildlife
               Refuge System is made up of about 750 million acres of water and 100 million acres of land in the
               United States. The USFWS is currently seeking public comments to the proposed rule for 30 days.

               Philanthropic Giving
               According to Giving USA 2017: The Annual Report on Philanthropy for the Year 2016, released
               on June 12, 2017, total charitable donations in the United States rose 2.7 percent in 2016 to
               $390.05 billion. Giving USA is the longest-running and most comprehensive report of its kind
               in the United States. The Report is published by Giving USA Foundation, part of The Giving
               Institute housed at the Indiana University Lilly Family School of Philanthropy. Details of the
               Report ­reveal that giving by individuals and foundations rose, but giving by bequest or estates
               fell sharply. The Report issued in June 2018 showed substantial increases in giving in the United
               States as the nation’s economy and stock markets improved substantially. The Lilly School at
               Indiana University also publishes The Philanthropy Outlook that currently projects increases in
               giving in the United States.

               Bird Watching
               The Department of Interior’s September 7, 2017, report shows that the largest increases in par-
               ticipation involve wildlife watching in recent years has come from observing and photographing
               wildlife. These activities surged 20 percent from 2011 to 2016, from 71.8 million to 86 ­million
               participants during that time. Expenditures by wildlife watchers rose sharply (28 percent)
               ­between 2011 and 2016, from $59.1 billion to $75.9 billion. Around-the-home wildlife watching
                increased 18 percent from 2011, from 68.6 million in 2011 to 81.1 million participants in 2016.
                Lower increases were reported for away-from-home wildlife watchers: 5 percent increase from
                2011 to 2016, from 22.5 million to 23 million participants.

               Competitors
               NAS competes indirectly with all wildlife or conservation-oriented nonprofit organizations
               that depend on donations to fund operations, including World Wildlife for Nature, Sierra Club,
               National Wildlife Federation, Ocean Conservancy, Defenders of Wildlife, Nature Conservancy,
               Cornucopia Institute, Friends of the Earth, Duck’s Unlimited, and even 350.org. However, one of
               these nonprofit organizations is most similar to NAS in focusing on bird conservation in North
               America; the entity is Duck’s Unlimited.

               Ducks Unlimited
               DU is an American nonprofit, volunteer-based 501(c) organization dedicated to the conservation
               of wetlands and associated upland habitats for waterfowl, other wildlife, and people. Founded
               by Joseph Knapp in 1937, DU has maintained a worldwide presence of about 700,000 members
               and 40,000 volunteers. As of January 1, 2017, DU had 620,853 adult members and 45,357 youth
               members, whereas DU Mexico had 4,662 members and DU Canada had 130,000 members.
                    DU looks to partner with a wide range of corporations, governments, communities, land-
               owners, and private citizens to restore and manage wetlands that have been degraded and to
               prevent ­further degradation. DU sources of revenue include federal and state habitat reimburse-
               ments, conservation easements, sponsors and members, major gifts and donations, and royal-
               ties/advertisement. Through its conservation activities, DU benefits biodiversity, water quality,
               the environment and the economy in the areas in which it is active.

    650    STRATEGIC-MANAGEMENT CASE ANALYSIS

                                        DU is the world’s largest private organization devoted to waterfowl habitat conserva-
                                   tion. Although ducks and geese are the primary beneficiaries of DU operations all over North
                                   America, all kinds of wildlife, people, and communities benefit from DU programs and
                                   initiatives.
                                        DU’s fiscal year ends on June 30. The DU FY17 saw the organization’s revenues decline
                                   slightly to $224 million as more than 58,000 DU volunteers hosted over 577,000 attendees at
                                   4,050 events, a slight increase over the prior year’s 3,900 events held. DU’s FY17 also benefited
                                   from 5,000 major donors and 700,000 members contributing over $86 million to the organiza-
                                   tion, an increase of $1.8 million over the prior year. Fully, 83 percent of all DU revenues in
                                   FY17 went to conservation. DU has an important partnership with Bass Pro Shops (BPS); BPS
                                   promotes DU on its BPS Chevrolet at NASCAR’s Coke Zero 400 in Daytona, Florida.
                                        In FY17, DU obtained 39 percent of its revenue from federal and state habitat support
                                   and nongovernmental partnerships while 25 percent was derived from events, sponsorships,
                                   and memberships. About 19 percent of DU’s funding came from donated conservation ease-
                                   ments and public service announcements, while another 12 percent came from major gifts and
                                   ­endowments. The remaining 5 percent came from royalties, advertising, and other sources. DU’s
                                    goal for its Rescue Our Wetlands campaign is to raise $2 billion for wetlands conversation by
                                    December 2018. DU’s FY17 ended with $1.82 billion raised, so the organization is close to
                                    reaching its $2 billion goal.

                                   Future
                                   Karen Thorne, an ecologist with the U.S. Geological Survey, revealed in early 2018 that as sea
                                   levels rise, waters will inundate all coastal marshes in California and Oregon, and most of those
                                   in Washington by 2110. However, Thorne reports that sea level rise will progress slowly through
                                   2050, then accelerate, giving today’s managers enough time to prepare marshes, and their birds,
                                   for the changes to come. Aududon plans to be at the forefront of initiatives to save birds on the
                                   U.S. west, Gulf, and east coasts.
                                         Some analysts suggest that Audubon should become less political in its approach to saving
                                   birds, being more compassionate to people affected by rising sea levels and other issues and
                                   initiatives. For example, Audubon often files lawsuits to shut down jetties being built in inlets
                                   and staunchly opposes oil drilling off the east coast of the United States, and a multitude of other
                                   initiatives. Analysts suggest that Audubon consult with local residents more genuinely before
                                   ­filing lawsuits, thus being less—or as some would say—staunch liberals.
                                         Audubon is concerned that philanthropic giving and donations may drop precipitously in
                                    2018–2020 given the new federal tax code that basically takes away philanthropic giving as a tax
                                    deduction. Audubon needs a clear strategic plan going forward as seas are rising and birds and
                                    people are being impacted.

               MTN Group Limited—2022

               www.mtn.com
               Headquartered in Johannesburg, South Africa, and with nearly 20,000 employees, MTN Group
               Limited (MTN) is a large mobile telecommunications company that provides Africa, the Middle
               East, and Asia with phone and Internet services. At year-end 2020, MTN reported having 280 million
               subscribers, making it the eighth largest mobile network firm in the world, and by far the largest
               phone and Internet provider in South Africa. MTN is active in 20 countries, but in Nigeria, the firm
               has 35 percent market share, and the country contributes a third of MTN’s total revenues. MTN’s
               common stock is listed on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange (JSE) under JSE: MTN.
                   In August 2020, MTN divested its stakes in various companies in Syria, Afghanistan, and
               Yemen and also sold its 49 percent minority holding in Irancell over time. The reason given by
               MTN for these actions was that overall the Middle East contributed less than 4 percent to Group
               earnings in the first half of 2020.
                   In February 2021, MTN partnered with Mastercard to facilitate global e-commerce payments
               of the MTN customer base in 16 African countries. This business action included a Mastercard
               virtual payment platform being linked to MTN MoMo (Mobile Money) wallets.
                   In March 2021, MTN CEO Ralph Mupita announced that the group was considering spin-
               ning off its mobile money activities. The estimated value of the group’s mobile money arm is at
               least $5 billion.

               History
               MTN was founded in 1994 when the South African government assisted a firm named M-Cell
               in beginning its operations. In 2009, MTN completed its purchase of Verizon Business South
               Africa, which provided network data services to five African countries. In both 2014 and
               2015, MTN was named the Most Admired and Most Valuable Brand in Africa. In September
               2020, MTN hired a new CEO, Ralph Mupita, to replace Rob Shuter, who had been the CEO
               of MTN for 4 years.
                   In 2020, MTN obtained 504 million licenses in Yemen, 1.19 billion in Ghana, 32 million in
               Nigeria, 24 million in Afghanistan, and 1.774 billion in Uganda, in comparison to the prior year’s
               31 million in Zambia, 51 million in Benin, 104 million in Ghana, 249 million in Nigeria, and 2 mil-
               lion in Uganda. MTN reported a profit after tax for 2020 of R$ 19.6 billion, up from the prior year’s
               R$ 10.8 billion. The company paid no dividends to shareholders in 2020.

               Mission/Vision Statement
               MTN seemingly does not have a written, published vision or mission statement, so proposed
               statements are provided below:

               Vision Statement
               To provide everyone in Africa with an affordable, modern, quality, and connected life.

               Mission Statement
               MTN is on a mission to provide leading digital solutions for Africa. We believe everyone in
               Africa deserves to have a modern, connected life through digital and financial inclusion. We will
               work diligently to fill the gaps and help supply Africa with more comprehensive coverage. We
               are working hard on providing 5G to our customers and achieve all we do through excellent and
               talented employees.

                                   Organizational Structure
                                   T. Molefe took over as CFO of MTN in mid-2021. R.A. Shuter resigned from the position of
                                   Group President and CEO in August 2020 and was replaced by R.T. Mupita, who was previously
                                   CFO of MTN. Exhibit 1 provides an organizational chart for the company. Note that numbers
                                   10, 11, and 12 report to number 2, indicating that the company operates from a divisional-by-
                                   region organizational design. However, only 3 of the 14 regional segments that are mentioned
                                   in the MTN Annual Report are clearly represented, so improvements are needed in the struc-
                                   tural alignment of MTN. Four of the 12 top executives—Y. Cuba, Lele Modise, T. Molefe, and
                                   F. Sekha—are female, which is a positive start.

                                   Financial Data and Statements
                                   As indicated in Exhibit 2, MTN reported an 18 percent revenue increase in 2020 and an 81 ­percent
                                   increase in net income versus the prior year, with Network Services accounting for most of the
                                   income. Recall from the chapters that shareholders expect at least a 5 percent top line (revenues)
                                   and bottom line (net income) growth from any firm annually, so MTN is doing very well based
                                   on that criteria.
                                       MTN’s balance sheets provided in Exhibit 3 reveal that the total equity in the firm increased
                                   23 percent in 2020. The firm combines goodwill and intangibles into one line item, so the ab-

                                   MTN reports segment data annually by both region and product. The regions are 1) South
                                   Africa, 2) Nigeria, 3) South and East Africa and Ghana (SEAGHA), 4) West and Central Africa
                                   (WECA), and Middle East and North Africa (MENA). SEAGHA is now called SEA as Ghana
                                   has been moved to WECA.
                                       Exhibit 4 provides a 2020 segment breakdown of MTN’s revenues across both regions and
                                   products. Note the bulk of revenue is from Network Services, but don’t forget about digital and
                                   fintech (financial technology). Fintech is a popular way to pay for goods and services across Africa
                                   and a key area of growth moving forward. Fintech is also related to and depends on the other divi-
                                   sions, so increases in fintech revenues will also increase revenues from the other segments.

                                             3. Disposal of the company’s 49 percent holdings in Uganda Tower InterCo and Ghana Tower

                   Of MTN’s revenue in 2020, outgoing voice calls led all income sources, accounting for
               over 64 percent more revenue than data, which was the second largest revenue driver. With the
               increased use of smartphones in Africa, which are slowly replacing feature phones, data will
               close in on voice calls as a revenue generator. At 20 percent, MTN’s Fintech and Mobile Money
               (MoMo) is the mobile money arm of the firm. Many people across Africa do not have bank ac-
               counts and do not carry money around with them, so MTN’s Fintech provides a secure, safe,
               and reliable way to pay for items. MoMo grew by 55 percent in the 2 years from March 2018 to
               March 2020, adding 12 million new active subscribers, with another 12 million added by March
               2021, bringing the total number of customers using the service to 47 million.

               Competitors
               MTN has more than 50 competitors around the world, but in South Africa, the company’s pri-
               mary competitors are Vodacom, Cell C, and Telkom Mobile.

               Vodacom South Africa
               Headquartered in Johannesburg, South Africa, and founded in 1994, Vodacom is 60.5 percent
               owned by Vodafone, one of the world’s largest telecommunications companies. Vodacom serves
               296 million people in Africa, especially in South Africa, Tanzania, the Congo, Mozambique,
               Lesotho, and Kenya. In July 2021, Vodacom and Nokia announced their successful trial of a
               high-speed optical transmission network that will support 5G and high-tech transmissions from
               Midrand to Cape Town in Africa.
                   Vodacom spent R$ 67 million in their fiscal year that ended March 31, 2021, deploying 3G
               and 4G Internet services at new sites in deep rural areas in Bethlehem, Fouriesburg, Clocolan,
               Fauresmith, Griekwastad, Bothaville, Kroonstad, Portsmaburg, Jagersfontein, Parys, Qwa-Qwa,
               Prieska, Kgalagadi, Theunissen, Ubuntu, Joe Morolong, Siyancuma, Tokologo, Mangaung,
               Tswaing, Ga-Segonyana, Kagisono-Molopo, Dikgatlong, Matjhabeng, Sol Plaatje, Dihlabeng,
               and Naledi. Vodacom’s Rural Coverage Acceleration Program is committed to expanding Internet
               coverage for people who live in deep rural areas of South Africa and beyond. This effort is hav-
               ing a significant positive societal impact in Africa: It allows tens of thousands of school-going

                                   banking services are now doing this on their smartphones at home.

                                   Cell C
                                   Founded in 2001 as a mobile communications company in South Africa, Cell C was appointed in
                                   March 2021 as one of the preferred service providers to the South African government for phone
                                   services from April 2021 to March 2026. One of the requirements for a firm looking to provide
                                   this nationwide phone service was that it had to already have at least 80 percent network cover-
                                   age throughout South Africa.
                                       Cell C reported revenues of R$ 13.8 billion in fiscal 2020, an 8 percent drop from the prior
                                   year, along with a net income loss of R$ 5.5 billion, on the heels of a loss of R$ 4 billion in fiscal
                                   2019. Cell C reports revenue by five types: Prepaid, Contract, Broadband, Mobile, and Other,
                                   which in millions of rand in fiscal 2020 were 6,191, 3,451, 703, 10,345, and 2,644, respectively.
                                   All of these revenue numbers were down on average 11 percent from the prior year. However,
                                   the company’s total subscriber base at the end of the fiscal year 2020 was 12.5 million, up from
                                   11.7 million the prior year.

                                   Telkom Mobile
                                   Founded in October 2010 and headquartered in Centurion, South Africa, Telkom is a large mobile
                                   telecommunications company. Telkom provides voice and data products and services using 2G and
                                   3G networks. The company offers both business and residential customers integrated voice, data,
                                   fixed voice, mobile IT, and data center solutions and services. Telkom reported revenues for their
                                   fiscal year that ended March 31, 2021, of R$ 43.2 billion, up from R$ 43.0 billion the prior year.
                                   The company’s profits reported on that date were R$ 2.4 million, up from 540 million the prior year.
                                   The South African Government owns 40.5 percent of Telkom, while 49.6 percent of the company
                                   shares are held by institutional shareholders. Telkom’s active mobile subscriber numbers were
                                   9.7 million in fiscal 2019, 12.0 million in fiscal 2020, and 15.3 million in fiscal 2021, up
                                   27.8 percent over those years, so the company is doing great. Telkom’s broadband subscriber
                                   numbers were 6.4 million in fiscal 2019, 8.2 million in fiscal 2020, and 10.3 million in fiscal 2021,
                                   up 25.6 percent over those years, which is more evidence that this is a major rival to MTN.

                                   External Issues
                                   There is a high positive correlation between increased Internet access and economic growth, so
                                   by providing connectivity in rural areas of Africa, MTN and Vodacom are spurring prosperity
                                   on the continent. A World Bank study recently concluded that a 10-percent increase in fixed
                                   broadband penetration could increase gross domestic product (GDP) growth by 1.21 percent in
                                   developed economies and 1.38 percent in developing ones. New Internet services in Africa are
                                   benefiting all segments of society, such as e-health, e-education, and e-commerce.
                                       Though spreading slowly throughout Africa, 5G delivers faster download and upload speeds,
                                   decreases the time it takes devices to communicate with wireless networks, and enables greater
                                   connectivity of devices than 4G or 3G networks; it would allow use of the cloud, big data, AI,
                                   and the Internet of Things (IoT), ultimately improving human lives.
                                       The World Economic Forum (WEF) recently reported that 5G will change the world even
                                   more profoundly than 3G and 4G and that it will be as revolutionary as electricity or the auto-
                                   mobile, benefiting entire economies and entire societies. Specifically, 5G will enable more ef-
                                   ficient manufacturing through predictive intelligence, improve workplace and worker safety, and
                                   enhance operational effectiveness in industries. For example, in the African agriculture sector,
                                   5G enables farmers to monitor the health of crops and livestock. An increase in broadband pen-
                                   etration is closely linked in Africa with job creation, improved education, better service delivery,
                                   and increased rural development.
                                       The eventual rollout of mobile broadband across Africa will spur new businesses and promote
                                   existing ones such as Uber, Facebook, and AirBnB as well as virtual classrooms and remote medi-
                                   cal service deliveries, changing the way people in Africa live. In fact, the WEF forecasts that 5G
                                   technology will create approximately R$ 55 trillion in economic output and 22.3 million jobs by
                                   2035 in South Africa alone. For example, within the energy sector, utilities, towns, cities, and vil-
                                   lages are turning to smart energy solutions such as smart metering and smart-grid communications.

               Investments in 5G networks by firms such as MTN and Vodacom will reach R$ 15 trillion world-
               wide by 2025, according to the Global System for Mobile Communication (GSM Association).

               Mobile Phone Shipments in Africa
               Smartphone shipments in Africa in 2018 and 2019 revealed that there were over 40 percent
               more feature phones shipped than smartphones. However, in 2020 this number declined to about
               26 percent, and this trend is expected to continue, which will likely create increased demand
               for 4G and 5G capabilities as more consumers use these services. Major Chinese manufacturer
               Transsion leads all market share in Africa with 44 percent of the phone market as of Q1 2021
               through its brands Tecno, Itel, and Infinix. Samsung, by comparison, held 23 percent of the mar-
               ket share during the same time. Chinese manufacturers Huawei, OPPO, and Xiaomi are all in the
               top 5 of market share in Africa. A major reason customers value these brands is that 42 percent
               of all smartphones in Africa can be purchased for less than $100.
                   Another reason for the increase in smartphones among Africans is simply that people gener-
               ally do not have a personal bank but are able to use a Mobile Money account to store and trans-
               fer funds, with 200 million users in sub-Saharan Africa, the Middle East, and Northern Africa
               making over 27 billion transactions in 2020. Exhibit 7 reveals the breakdown of feature phones
               versus smartphones in Africa.

               Mobile Phones Provide Financial Inclusion in Africa
               Many people in Africa cannot afford to do business with a bank and carrying large amounts of
               cash around or even storing large amounts of cash at home is as much of a problem in Africa
               as in the rest of the world. In fact, in Nigeria alone, one of the richest nations in Africa, only
               2.6 percent of adults own a credit card. Payments requiring even small amounts of cash are
               much safer to pay electronically, and much more convenient. The concept of mobile money is
               a growing solution to this problem in Africa, allowing millions to store, use, and transfer funds
               electronically. In 2020 alone, 200 million people in Africa and the Middle East made 28 billion
               transactions and a total of nearly $800 billion in transactions were made in 2020 through this
               medium, with $490 billion being exchanged in sub-Saharan Africa.

               Nigerian Market
               Nigeria, home to Africa’s largest population and one of the youngest in the world, has a flourish-
               ing digital marketplace. The nation has excellent mobile infrastructure, with nearly 60 percent
               of residents having access to the Internet and around 50 percent owning a mobile phone. Nearly
               75 percent of Internet access in Nigeria is over mobile devices, and this number is even higher

                                   for online purchases. However, much of the problem with the other 50 percent not owning a mo-
                                   bile phone stems from broadband coverage in more rural areas. There is a clear need for further
                                   investment and infrastructure in these areas. Between 2018 and 2019, the online food retail and
                                   personal care markets in Nigeria increased about 50 percent and the online fashion sector in-
                                   creased over 40 percent. In general, Nigerians hold positive feelings about online shopping, with
                                   travel as the most profitable online business.
                                       Cash is still the primary payment method in Nigeria. Out of 137 nations, Nigeria ranked
                                   118th on credit card usage, and just 27 percent of online retail purchases are made with credit
                                   cards. Online payments are extremely popular in Nigeria, with 10 percent of payments coming
                                   from e-wallets such as KongaPay and PayPal. There is a growing trend toward mobile money in
                                   Nigeria and many other African nations. Customers can now easily spend and send money over
                                   their mobile phone. Banks can provide the service, but telecom companies are increasingly the
                                   payment service provider in this scenario.

                                   Conclusion
                                   Strategy Considerations
                                   Given the really strong competitors described in the case, MTN’s CEO Mupita needs a quality
                                   strategy plan. MTN operates in one of the fastest-growing regions of the world, but it is also one
                                   where the GDP trails behind that of many other nations. The haves versus have-nots can present
                                   quite a large disparity across Africa and the Middle East. Recall from the segment data that most
                                   of MTN’s revenues are generated from mobile devices, but fintech is an up-and-coming technol-
                                   ogy. Recall as well that mobile devices in South Africa generate significant income, but not so
                                   much in other regions. What nations do you think CEO Mupita should focus on? MTN, like all
                                   companies, has limited resources, and deciding which countries and services to further develop
                                   is paramount for success.
                                        Even attempting to decide which customers to serve is important. Should MTN focus on
                                   wealthy, profitable customers only, or should they continue to push and develop in rural Africa?
                                   Providing Internet services to those who cannot pay is certainly a noble mission, but MTN has to
                                   earn sufficient profits to pay the bills and keep its shareholders happy.
                                        What would you suggest CEO Mupita do with regard to acquiring new technology? Should
                                   new technologies be developed in-house, organically, through increased R&D, or can you iden-
                                   tify organizations that MTN should try to purchase to quickly acquire the necessary technology?
                                   Deciding where to allocate resources, what markets to enter, to what extent to invest in R&D, and
                                   whether to purchase rival firms are only a few of the many major strategic issues facing MTN.
                                        Help CEO Mupita develop a comprehensive 3-year strategic plan. Be sure not to simply re-
                                   port what the firm is doing or what you think the firm will be doing based on the news releases
                                   (unless you also agree with these plans based on your research and analyses). Develop a plan for
                                   what you think the firm needs to do, as if you were hired as a pricy consultant to develop and
                                   submit a roadmap for the future of MTN.
