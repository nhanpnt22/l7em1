Critical Analysis of Strategic Theories and Models in Global Context
Introduction
Strategy represents the long-term direction of an organization and serves as a fundamental concept in business management. As Whittington et al. (2022, p.59) define it, strategy encompasses "the long-term direction of an organisation," including both deliberate planning and emergent patterns. In today's globally interconnected business environment, understanding strategic theories and models is essential for effective decision-making, particularly when navigating cross-cultural and international contexts.

1. Fundamental Strategic Theories
1.1 Defining Strategy: Multiple Perspectives
The concept of strategy has evolved considerably since its military origins, with several key theorists offering complementary perspectives:

Chandler's Definition: Strategy as "the determination of the basic long-term goals and objectives of an enterprise, and the adoption of courses of action and the allocation of resources necessary for carrying out these goals" (Whittington et al., 2022, p.5). This definition emphasizes logical resource allocation but underestimates emergent aspects.

Porter's Perspective: Strategy involves "deliberately choosing a different set of activities to deliver a unique mix of value" (Whittington et al., 2022, p.5). This definition highlights differentiation and competitive positioning but may overemphasize deliberate choice in uncertain global environments.

Mintzberg's View: Strategy as a "pattern in a stream of decisions" (Whittington et al., 2022, p.5). This importantly recognizes that strategies often emerge through incremental decisions rather than grand plans—particularly relevant in diverse international markets where adaptation is crucial.

Critical Analysis: Each definition captures important aspects of strategy but also has limitations when applied globally. Whittington et al.'s inclusive definition encompasses both deliberate and emergent strategy, which is particularly valuable when operating across diverse international contexts where different strategic approaches may be required simultaneously.

2. Key Strategic Models for Global Context
2.1 Blue Ocean Strategy
Blue Ocean Strategy focuses on creating uncontested market space rather than competing in existing markets (Bourletidis, 2014). The model advocates simultaneous differentiation and low cost to create new market space and demand.

Critical Analysis: In global contexts, Blue Ocean Strategy offers valuable perspectives on identifying untapped markets across geographical boundaries. However, the model may underestimate institutional and cultural barriers to market creation in diverse international settings. Its emphasis on breaking conventional boundaries aligns well with international expansion but requires careful consideration of local market conditions and regulatory environments.

2.2 Porter's Five Forces
Porter's Five Forces analyzes competitive forces: threat of new entrants, bargaining power of suppliers, bargaining power of buyers, threat of substitutes, and competitive rivalry (Whittington et al., 2022, pp.63-68).

Critical Analysis: While valuable for industry analysis, Porter's model presents several limitations in global contexts:

It assumes relatively stable industry boundaries, which often blur in rapidly evolving global markets
The relative strength of each force varies significantly across different countries and regions
It underestimates the role of governments and regulatory bodies, which significantly impact competitive dynamics in international settings
The model doesn't adequately address collaborative strategies increasingly important in global value networks
As Indiatsy et al. (2014) note, the framework must be adapted for different national contexts where competitive dynamics may operate differently.

2.3 VRIO Framework
The VRIO framework assesses resources and capabilities based on Value, Rarity, Inimitability, and Organizational support (Whittington et al., 2022, pp.96-101).

Critical Analysis: In global contexts, VRIO provides a useful tool for assessing competitive advantage, but with important limitations:

Resources valuable in one market may be insignificant in another due to different customer preferences
Rarity is relative to specific geographical markets—resources common in developed markets may be rare in emerging economies
Inimitability varies across regulatory environments with different intellectual property protections
Organizational structures effective in one cultural context may be ineffective in others
As Indartono and Wibowo (2017) highlight, the framework connects more to vision than comprehensive strategy, which may limit its applicability to complex global operations requiring coherent coordination across diverse markets.

3. Strategic Position Analysis Models
3.1 PESTEL Analysis
The PESTEL framework analyzes macro-environmental factors: Political, Economic, Social, Technological, Ecological and Legal (Whittington et al., 2022, pp.73-78).

Critical Analysis: PESTEL is particularly valuable for global strategy as it explicitly addresses the diverse external factors organizations face when operating internationally. Its structured approach helps identify significant variations between markets. However, its breadth can lead to superficial analysis without prioritization of the most critical factors for specific regions or contexts. The framework's effectiveness depends heavily on the depth of local knowledge applied to each element.

3.2 The Strategy Lenses Framework
Whittington et al. (2022, pp.184-195) offer four "strategy lenses":

Design Lens: Strategy as deliberate, analytical planning
Experience Lens: Strategy as emergent patterns based on experience
Variety Lens: Strategy as evolutionary selection of initiatives
Discourse Lens: Strategy as communication and language
Critical Analysis: The multi-lens approach is particularly valuable in international contexts where different strategic perspectives may be required simultaneously. Western organizations might default to design approaches while Asian contexts may favor experience-based approaches. The framework acknowledges this diversity of strategic approaches but doesn't provide clear guidance on managing the tensions between perspectives in global organizations.

4. International Strategy Models
4.1 Global Integration vs. Local Responsiveness Matrix
This framework (Whittington et al., 2022, pp.280-285) identifies four international strategy approaches:

Global: High global integration, low local responsiveness
Multidomestic: Low global integration, high local responsiveness
Transnational: High global integration, high local responsiveness
International: Low global integration, low local responsiveness
Critical Analysis: This framework explicitly addresses the fundamental tension in global strategy between standardization and adaptation. Its strength lies in recognizing different strategic approaches for different contexts. However, the model simplifies the complex continuum of integration and responsiveness decisions organizations face across different business functions and geographical markets. The transnational ideal is conceptually appealing but extremely challenging to implement in practice.

4.2 Entry Mode Selection Models
Whittington et al. (2022) discuss various models for international market entry, including export, licensing, franchising, joint ventures, acquisitions, and greenfield investments.

Critical Analysis: These models provide valuable frameworks for a critical entry decision, but each comes with limitations:

They often present entry mode as a one-time decision rather than an evolving process
Many underestimate the importance of institutional and cultural factors in entry mode success
The models may overemphasize formal strategic planning while underplaying emergent adaptation
There's often insufficient attention to exit strategies if market entry proves unsuccessful

5. Strategic Alliances and Global Value Chain Models
Global strategy increasingly involves collaborative relationships across organizational boundaries (Whittington et al., 2022, pp.309-315).

Critical Analysis: Alliance models recognize the importance of inter-organizational relationships in global strategy but often:

Underestimate the complexity of managing relationships across cultural boundaries
Focus on formal structures over relational dynamics
Provide insufficient guidance on managing power asymmetries between partners
Neglect the dynamic evolution of collaborative relationships over time
The global value chain perspective offers valuable insights into how organizations structure activities across borders but may overemphasize economic rationality while underplaying institutional, cultural, and political factors that shape global operations.

6. Conclusion: Integrating Models for Global Strategy
No single strategic theory or model provides a complete framework for global corporate strategy. The most effective approach combines multiple models while recognizing their limitations. As the unit materials note, the increasingly popular approach of "Think globally, act locally" acknowledges the tension between global integration and local adaptation that runs through many strategic models.

The critical analysis of these models reveals both their value and limitations. For EMBA students, the key skill is not just understanding individual models but developing the judgment to select, adapt, and combine them appropriately for specific global contexts. This requires appreciation of both theoretical frameworks and practical realities of international business.
